in 9@@ 11 C@@ all , Profess@@ or admits to shooting gir@@ l@@ friend
in a 9@@ 11 call , his voice only slightly shaky , college professor S@@ han@@ non lam@@ b told police he had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and officers needed to get over to their house .
lam@@ b made a point to say his `` swe@@ et dog '@@ ' was there alive and probably upset , and said the dead woman '@@ s family contacts could be found on her phone .
inside the home , officers found A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss ' body and a hand@@ -@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white legal pad : `` I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me , '@@ ' read the letter authorities say was signed by lam@@ b .
there was no indication that lam@@ b , who was teaching two online classes for Del@@ ta State University in C@@ le@@ vel@@ and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , had already traveled 300 miles to the school '@@ s cam@@ pus , where police believe he shot and killed a well-@@ liked history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , in the do@@ or@@ way to his office .
Del@@ ta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a@@ .@@ m .
he said lam@@ b made the f@@ ate@@ ful 9@@ 11 call sometime after that .
by the end of the day , there would be one more death : lam@@ b took his own life as police closed in on him .
a day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated lam@@ b .
the details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped pa@@ int a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
students said they looked forward to his class .
police in G@@ au@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmidt himself had included lam@@ b in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the `` wonderful people '@@ ' he shared his academic life with .
both taught in the Di@@ vision of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 faculty members , and many students took courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations of problems .
a student who praised lam@@ b , Bran@@ don Be@@ av@@ ers , said he also seemed agit@@ ated and jit@@ tery , `` like there was something wrong with him . '@@ '
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said lam@@ b told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 20@@ 14@@ -@@ 15 academic year .
lam@@ b had earlier asked Del@@ ta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
this year , he was only teaching two online classes .
recent changes in the university '@@ s hiring policies meant that the doc@@ torate lam@@ b had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assi@@ stant professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did n@@ '@@ t know of any conflict between lam@@ b and Schmidt but `` obviously there was something in Mr. lam@@ b '@@ s mind . '@@ '
those are questions lam@@ b can no longer answer .
after fleeing the cam@@ pus , police later picked up lam@@ b '@@ s tra@@ il when he crossed back into Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i from Ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as .
before he could be ap@@ prehen@@ ded , lam@@ b killed himself with a single .@@ 3@@ 8-@@ cali@@ ber p@@ ist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a home about a mile south of his parents ' home on the out@@ skir@@ ts of Green@@ v@@ ille , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , said Washington Coun@@ ty cor@@ oner Me@@ the@@ l Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to that home , though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lam@@ b grew up in the area .
lam@@ b started working at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 , in 2009 and taught geography and education classes .
he received a doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
one of lam@@ b '@@ s long@@ time friends described him as smart , charismatic and fun@@ ny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older gu@@ y who tried for several years to teach her to play gu@@ it@@ ar .
he was quite the heart@@ thro@@ b back then .
all the girls would mel@@ t when he was around , '@@ ' said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had apparently been dating for some time .
in the 9@@ 11 call , lam@@ b said `` I killed my wife , '@@ ' but there was no record of them ever mar@@ rying .
they had a dog named ligh@@ t@@ ning that lived with them at the br@@ ick house that backs up to a ba@@ you in G@@ au@@ tier .
police said the dog was O@@ K .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss ' ex-@@ husband , Sha@@ wn O@@ '@@ Ste@@ en , said they divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who '@@ s now 19 .
`` S@@ he was completely devastated , '@@ ' O@@ '@@ Ste@@ en said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O@@ '@@ Ste@@ en said he had not met lam@@ b but heard through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail that lam@@ b was interested in music and played the Blu@@ es .
lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
later , they played together in the occasional gi@@ g .
O@@ '@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mi@@ ke Sha@@ ff@@ er , a bar@@ ten@@ der and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Ro@@ om , a di@@ m@@ ly lit bar near G@@ au@@ tier , said he last saw lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss the night of Sep@@ t . 5 , after lam@@ b had finished playing his gu@@ it@@ ar and harmon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crowd .
there was no sign of anything am@@ iss .
`` Ju@@ st a happy couple , '@@ ' he said .
we were cutting up and throwing one-@@ liners at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of w@@ it about them .
Schmidt , the sla@@ in professor , directed the first-@@ year semin@@ ar program and specialized in N@@ ative American and colonial history , said D@@ on Al@@ lan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three young children .
he studied at Em@@ po@@ ria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his frater@@ nity and student government .
on the Del@@ ta State cam@@ pus in C@@ le@@ vel@@ and on Tu@@ es@@ day night , about 900 people , including faculty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a cand@@ le@@ light mem@@ orial .
Schmidt '@@ s wife , Li@@ z , and brother J@@ ef@@ f Schmidt also attended the vig@@ il , during which the university cho@@ ir san@@ g `` B@@ right Mor@@ ning St@@ ar '@@ ' and `` amazing grace . '@@ '
classes resume W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day .
`` We '@@ re trying to get our students to come back , '@@ ' La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ ge@@ li@@ o S@@ oli@@ s reported from C@@ le@@ vel@@ and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i .
associated Pre@@ ss writers Em@@ ily W@@ ag@@ ster P@@ et@@ tus in Green@@ v@@ ille , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , and Re@@ bec@@ ca S@@ ant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying lam@@ b made the 9@@ 11 call after shooting Schmidt , and that while lam@@ b referred to Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in the 9@@ 11 call , there is no indication the two ever married .

to@@ ys R US says it wo n@@ '@@ t hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year , but the to@@ y and baby products re@@ tail@@ er says it will give current employees and seas@@ onal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work at stores and distribution centers around the country , down from the 4@@ 5,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season .
most of the jobs will be part-time .
the company said it will start inter@@ viewing applic@@ ants this month , with staff levels rising from October through December .
while the holid@@ ays themselves are months away , holiday shopping season is drawing closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to help them staff stores and sell , ship and deliver products .

UN Chief says There Is No Military Sol@@ ution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-@@ moon says his response to Russia '@@ s stepped up military support for Syria is that `` there is no military solution '@@ ' to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the U@@ .@@ N@@ . chief again urged all parties , including the divided U@@ .@@ N@@ . Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly '@@ s ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers `` made this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . '@@ '
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 poll numbers That S@@ how Donald trump Is For Re@@ al
some have tried to label him a fli@@ p-@@ f@@ lop@@ per .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are holding out for an implosion .
but no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald trump down from at@@ op the polls , it has n@@ '@@ t worked -LRB- yet -RRB- .
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald trump '@@ s lead at double dig@@ its , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l '@@ s nomination chances .
of course , it '@@ s still early in the election cycle .
none of this is to say that trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
pundits point out that at this time in 2011 , R@@ ick Per@@ ry '@@ s lead was giving way to a rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bush '@@ s Sup@@ er PA@@ C and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing trump '@@ s staying power and beginning to un@@ load their dollars to topple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is n@@ '@@ t just a passing phase :
trump '@@ s favor@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
right before Donald trump announced his candidacy in mid-@@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid-@@ July , it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald trump .
roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac poll in I@@ ow@@ a last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of trump .
two-thirds of G@@ OP voters would be happy with trump as the nominee .
in a CN@@ N@@ /@@ OR@@ C poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either `` enthusiastic '@@ ' or `` satisfied '@@ ' if trump were the nominee .
only two in 10 say they would be `` upset '@@ ' if he were the nominee .
only Ben Car@@ son generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as trump -LRB- 43 percent say they would be `` enthusiastic '@@ ' vs@@ . 40 percent who say the same of trump -RRB- .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
Mar@@ co Ru@@ bi@@ o with only 21 percent .
on the fli@@ p side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be `` dis@@ satisfied '@@ ' or `` upset '@@ ' if establishment favorite Je@@ b Bush becomes the nominee .
a majority of Republicans do n@@ '@@ t see trump '@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald trump has been widely criticized for his bomb@@ ast and insul@@ ts , 52 percent of lean@@ ed Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament to be president , according to M@@ ond@@ ay '@@ s A@@ BC New@@ s@@ /@@ Washington Post poll .
the same number holds in the first-@@ in-@@ the-@@ nation cau@@ c@@ us state of I@@ ow@@ a , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
still , 44 percent think he does n@@ '@@ t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independ@@ ents say his temper@@ ament does not belong in the White House , according to A@@ B@@ C@@ /@@ Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their pund@@ it hat@@ s , Republican voters think trump is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the G@@ OP nomination , four in 10 said trump was the best bet , according to a CN@@ N@@ /@@ OR@@ C poll out last week .
that '@@ s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Je@@ b Bush in late July .
full disclosure : G@@ OP voters have n@@ '@@ t had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycle , four in 10 Republicans picked R@@ ick Per@@ ry to win the nomination , vs@@ . only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
still , it shows that a plurality of G@@ OP voters see trump '@@ s campaign as plausible .
even if Republicans rallied around another candidate , trump still be@@ ats almost everyone .
some pundits point out that the spl@@ inter@@ ed field is likely contributing to trump '@@ s lead , while anti-@@ Tru@@ mp support is be spread diff@@ u@@ sely among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a Mon@@ mouth University poll in early September shows that , in a hypothetical head@@ -to-@@ head mat@@ ch@@ up between trump and most other Republican candidates , trump almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
he leads C@@ arly F@@ ior@@ ina by 13 points , Mar@@ co Ru@@ bi@@ o by 14 points , Wal@@ ker by 15 points , Je@@ b Bush by 19 points , and , finally , R@@ and Paul , John K@@ asi@@ ch and Ch@@ ris Christi@@ e by 33 points each .
he '@@ s in a dead heat with T@@ ed C@@ ru@@ z .
the only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would lead the busines@@ sman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head@@ -to-@@ head .
a bare majority of Donald trump '@@ s supporters say they '@@ ve made up their minds .
a new C@@ BS@@ /@@ N@@ Y@@ T poll out on Tu@@ es@@ day shows that just more than half of voters who support trump say they have locked in their votes .
obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to swit@@ ching candidates .
still , trump '@@ s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for trump .
six in 10 Republicans say they agree with trump on immigration .
even since Donald trump called immigrants from Mexico `` rap@@ ists '@@ ' in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation .
some are worried that trump '@@ s bomb@@ ast will drive crucial Hisp@@ anic voters away from the Republican Party and damage re@@ bran@@ ding efforts .
but according to M@@ ond@@ ay '@@ s new A@@ B@@ C@@ /@@ Post poll , six in 10 Republicans say they agree with trump on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems Donald trump will remain too .
frustration with government is clim@@ bing to new highs .
Donald trump and Ben Car@@ son now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their outsider status .
six in 10 Republicans in M@@ ond@@ ay '@@ s new A@@ B@@ C@@ /@@ Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington , too .
a des Mo@@ ines regist@@ er@@ /@@ B@@ loom@@ berg poll in I@@ ow@@ a from two weeks ago shows that three in four I@@ ow@@ a Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent `` un@@ satisfied '@@ ' and 21 percent `` mad as hell . '@@ '
MPs support greater state share in coal fees
Czech Republic to gain more than 400 million crow@@ ns
the Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties has supported the government '@@ s amend@@ ment to the mining Act , which ad@@ ju@@ sts the yield from fees from the open-@@ cast mining of bro@@ wn coal from mining companies .
Minister Jan M@@ lá@@ dek -LRB- Č@@ SS@@ D -RRB- told MPs that this will mean that both the state treasury and municipalities will receive more money .
the proposal was critici@@ sed by opposition MPs , who are afraid that that mining companies will no longer want to spon@@ sor municipalities as before , as they would have to pay higher fees directly into state coff@@ er@@ s@@ .@@ The Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties has supported the government '@@ s amend@@ ment to the mining Act , which ad@@ ju@@ sts the yield from fees from the open-@@ cast mining of bro@@ wn coal from mining companies .
the state '@@ s share shall increase to 67 percent , whole municipalities ' share shall be reduced from the current 75 percent to 33 percent .
the proposal also al@@ ters the method for the calculation of payments for miner@@ als min@@ ed by companies .
a change in fees for the mining of miner@@ als is to bring 4@@ 27 million crow@@ ns more into state coffers than was the case in 2013 .
according to the government , the measure will have a neutral effect on the income of municipalities as fees will be higher .
in the year before last , municipalities gained appro@@ x . 450 million crow@@ ns and the state treasury 150 million crow@@ ns .
municipalities gained around 200 million crow@@ ns and the state 66 million crow@@ ns from li@@ gn@@ ite mining .
the amend@@ ment also anti@@ cip@@ ates the increase in payments from extrac@@ tion areas with mining permits to one thousand crow@@ ns per hec@@ t@@ are per year .
the enti@@ re@@ ty of income generated from these payment shall remain with the municipalities .
Minister for Indu@@ stry Jan M@@ lá@@ dek -LRB- Č@@ SS@@ D -RRB- told MPs that , thanks to this , municipalities will receive 100 million crow@@ ns per year , as opposed to the previous figure of 14 million crow@@ ns .
the amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law , but stipu@@ lated by the government through decre@@ es .
payments will be calculated as the product of the quantity of miner@@ als min@@ ed and rates for individual types of mineral .
according to the government , the reason for the change is , among others , the option of reacting flexi@@ bly to the current economic situation .
however , M@@ P M@@ are@@ k Ben@@ da -LRB- O@@ DS -RRB- warned that the setting of fees by government decre@@ e may not be in accordance with the constitution .
Minister M@@ lá@@ dek responded saying that this would not be a tax , as in this case the government is making miner@@ als - which are state property - subject to a fee .
fees are received by the municipalities whose territory is affected by mining .
in the case of deep coal mining , three-quarters of the money is received by municipalities and one quarter by the state .
the same proportions shall apply to the extrac@@ tion of radioactive ro@@ cks .
part of the money collected by the state from fees shall be tied to a single purpose .
for example , 28 percent must be directed towards the remed@@ ying of damage following mining or the funding of the mine rescue service .
the proposal was today critici@@ sed by opposition MPs , who chiefly claimed that it would harm both municipalities and regional governments .
for example , Mich@@ al Ku@@ čer@@ a -LRB- top 0@@ 9 a Sta@@ rost@@ ové -RRB- warned that mining companies would no longer want to spon@@ sor municipalities as before , as they would have to pay higher fees directly into state coffers .
`` You ca n@@ '@@ t asset-@@ strip some of the poorest regions just so that the Finance Minister can improve his budget , '@@ ' said David K@@ ád@@ ner -LRB- Ú@@ sv@@ it -RRB- , whose constituency is in the Ú@@ stí nad La@@ bem Regi@@ on
Communist M@@ P H@@ ana Au@@ lic@@ ká also warned of increased unemployment in the Most area .
K@@ ád@@ ner and Au@@ lic@@ ká un@@ successfully proposed the rejection of the amend@@ ment , and Ku@@ čer@@ a wanted to return it to the government for revision .
the explan@@ atory report states that , according to extrac@@ tion companies , increases in fees would not be transmitted to coal prices as more than 90 percent of these are agreed on a long-term basis .
the chief consumers , power stations , would not , therefore , feel an increase in prices .
`` On the other hand , though , this fact increases the risk that extrac@@ tion organis@@ ations will compensate for increased payments with efforts to reduce their operating costs , which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees , '@@ ' admits the government .
however , it also stated that a fee increase would be bearable in terms of employment .
according to Milan Ur@@ ban -LRB- Č@@ SS@@ D -RRB- , who tab@@ led the amend@@ ment , a key issue is for MPs to know the conclusions reached regarding the up@@ dated energy concept and , chiefly , the government '@@ s decision on coal extrac@@ tion limits before passing the law .
he emphasi@@ sed that , were coal to be min@@ ed beyond the limits , it would have an impact on yields for both the state and municipalities .
urban does not agree with M@@ lá@@ dek on the fact that the decision on the breaking of the limit at the Českosloven@@ ské armády mine should only be taken after 2020 .
he said that limits at the Českosloven@@ ské armády mine should be broken due to social reasons , the national economy and the Czech energy sector .
V@@ es@@ el@@ ý to lead the Czechs as number one , se@@ eding will be affected by the weather .
all four Czech ten@@ nis players will appear on the table at T@@ hur@@ sday '@@ s draw for the Dav@@ is Cup pla@@ y-@@ off in India , and this time all of them will probably play .
due to the difficult weather conditions , cap@@ tain Jaro@@ sla@@ v Nav@@ rá@@ til is planning to spread the burden across all four players .
the weather in Delhi is hot , with high hu@@ mid@@ ity , and it is expected that the matches , which could stretch to five sets , will be demanding .
we must take that into account .
I '@@ d like to spread it out according to the weather
and according to how it '@@ s going , said Nav@@ rá@@ til at the Czech team '@@ s training session today at the R@@ aj@@ a K@@ um@@ ar K@@ han@@ na Cent@@ re .
team number one and world number forty Ji@@ ří V@@ es@@ el@@ ý is expected to take part in both the Fri@@ day and Sunday sing@@ les .
Lu@@ ká@@ š Ro@@ sol and Ra@@ dek Š@@ tě@@ pá@@ nek will probably take it in turns as the team number two .
I would like almost all of them to be involved .
I have an idea in my head , but I wo n@@ '@@ t talk about it now , said the cap@@ tain .
another certainty in the Czech lin@@ e-up should be Š@@ tě@@ pá@@ nek '@@ s participation in the Satur@@ day doub@@ les .
the only question is who will line up alongside the experienced doub@@ les player , who has an 18 : 4 record in doub@@ les in the Dav@@ is Cup .
it probably wo n@@ '@@ t be V@@ es@@ el@@ ý .
the remaining options are with Ro@@ sol or Adam Pav@@ lá@@ sek .
I really do n@@ '@@ t know who he '@@ ll play with and what it '@@ ll look like , '@@ ' said Nav@@ rá@@ til .
he said that he would decide according to how the sing@@ les develop .
one option could be Pav@@ lá@@ sek , who provided for a surprise win in the 1st round against the Austr@@ alians .
`` He '@@ s decent in doub@@ les , '@@ ' said Nav@@ rá@@ til .
it worked for me against Australia , and if I play , I '@@ d like to give the same performance that I did there from the second set on@@ wards .
`` I '@@ m gla@@ d for the experience and I '@@ d like to score a point , '@@ ' said Pav@@ lá@@ sek .
the home team will put Yu@@ ki B@@ ham@@ br@@ i -LRB- 1@@ 25@@ th in the AT@@ P ran@@ kings -RRB- , who won the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tourna@@ ment in Shang@@ ha@@ j last week , where he beat players ranked in the 3@@ 0@@ 0s and 4@@ 0@@ 0s , into the sing@@ les .
the number two will be Som@@ dev Dev@@ v@@ arm@@ an -LRB- 16@@ 4@@ th -RRB- .
both players are on the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tour and ours have AT@@ P experience , but we '@@ ve seen many times that ran@@ kings do n@@ '@@ t play a decisive role in the Dav@@ is Cup .
`` What decides are moment@@ ary form and the weather , '@@ ' said Nav@@ rá@@ til .
Fri@@ day '@@ s opening sing@@ les rub@@ bers start at 0@@ 6 : 30 CE@@ S@@ T and may last longer due to the weather .
forecasts say that it will rain and the court is not covered .
however , it will be possible to play under flo@@ od@@ lights .
they '@@ ve sor@@ ted it out now and the lights have about two thousand lu@@ x , which is plenty .
`` It should be possible to play it to a finish under lights , '@@ ' said Nav@@ rá@@ til .
Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n to make de@@ but at Prime Minister '@@ s questions
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n '@@ s de@@ but at P@@ M@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ enly awa@@ ited
new Labour leader Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his de@@ but at Prime Minister '@@ s questions later , taking on David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six all@@ ot@@ ted questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance likely to be closely scrutin@@ ised by the media and Labour MPs .
he has called for `` less the@@ at@@ re and more facts '@@ ' at the weekly show@@ piece .
he has also said he could ski@@ p some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n '@@ s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the T@@ U@@ C annual congress on Tu@@ es@@ day .
meanwhile , the Labour leader '@@ s decision to stand in silence during the sing@@ ing of the national an@@ them at a service on Tu@@ es@@ day to mark the 7@@ 5@@ th anniversary of the B@@ attle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n '@@ s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had `` stood in respec@@ tful silence '@@ ' and did recogni@@ se the `` heroism of the Royal Air Force in the B@@ attle of Britain . '@@ '
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n '@@ s shadow cabinet , O@@ w@@ en Smith , told BBC Two '@@ s New@@ s@@ night program@@ me he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them `` irrespective '@@ ' of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n '@@ s top team , citing differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspond@@ ent Rob@@ in B@@ rant says policy differences are also `` st@@ ac@@ king up '@@ ' within Labour following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n '@@ s appointment over its position on the European Union and the government '@@ s cap on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the T@@ U@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secretary , said the party was `` very clear '@@ ' that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 2@@ 6,000 to £ 2@@ 3,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the desp@@ at@@ ch box over the past decade since he became T@@ ory leader .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has `` crowd sour@@ ced '@@ ' ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ ling@@ ton North M@@ P has said P@@ M@@ Q@@ s is too confron@@ tational and that he will refrain from both `` repar@@ tee '@@ ' and trading bar@@ bs , instead vo@@ wing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela E@@ ag@@ le , the shadow business secretary , will de@@ pu@@ tise for him at P@@ M@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travel@@ ling abroad .
he has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had approached the Common@@ s Spe@@ aker John Ber@@ cow to discuss the issue .

pound rises as UK wage growth acceler@@ ates
the pound jumped following data showing a p@@ ick@@ -up in UK wage growth , while the FT@@ S@@ E 100 was led higher by bid target SA@@ B@@ M@@ ill@@ er .
between May and July , UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period last year .
the rate was the fastest since 2009 , and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise .
sterling rose more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 5@@ 0@@ 5 and was up 0.@@ 84 % against the euro at € 1.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 30 .
the FT@@ S@@ E 100 index closed up 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 2@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ M@@ ill@@ er was the stand@@ -out stock on the market , ju@@ mping 20 % after it received a bid approach from rival A@@ B In@@ Be@@ v .
a deal would combine the world '@@ s two largest bre@@ wers , bringing together brands such as Bud@@ we@@ iser , S@@ tel@@ la Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and G@@ rol@@ sch .
Bur@@ ber@@ ry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Rich@@ em@@ on@@ t .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ t '@@ s latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ ber@@ ry - had begun to grow again .
shares in Glen@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said it had raised $ 2.@@ 5@@ bn through a share pla@@ cement as part of its debt-@@ cutting strategy .
shares in pack@@ aging and paper group M@@ ond@@ i were the biggest fal@@ lers on the index , down 4.3 % , after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the firm to `` sell . '@@ '

J@@ D S@@ ports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
J@@ D S@@ ports Executive Chairman Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean `` more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers . '@@ '
but that spending power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs at his firm , he says .
the costs could hit J@@ D S@@ ports ' expansion plans , he added , which could mean fewer extra jobs .
opponents of ` mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ' fla@@ ts celebrate .
controversial building halted .
investor Pra@@ ga Pro@@ get@@ ti e In@@ v@@ estim@@ enti considers the ruling to be unlawful and will appeal .
hundreds of people protested against the building , which was to be built in the close vic@@ in@@ ity of the Con@@ vent of St. Ag@@ nes , in front of the Prague 1 Mun@@ ici@@ pal Authority . a petition was also submitted .
in its ruling the municipal authority stated that there was a breach of the Bu@@ il@@ ding Act , as not all mandatory aspects of the planning decision were observed .
according to the ruling , `` The planning decision in question does not contain several mandatory requirements , for example type of land , distance from neighb@@ our@@ ing buildings , sufficiently clear , comprehensible description of the shape of the building and de@@ line@@ ation of the area affected by construction . '@@ '
the municipal authority also considers the fact that some documents submitted for the decision were issued for the document@@ ation originally discussed , which , however , changed , to be unlawful .
these include , for example , the opinion of environmental bodies .
part of the building was to be built on land belonging to the National gal@@ lery , whose permission the investor had not , however , obtained .
it follows from official material submitted that the owner of the land only gave its consent to the project material for the planning process , and not to the location of the building on its land , wrote the construction office .
according to Fran@@ ces@@ co Augu@@ sto R@@ az@@ et@@ to from the investment company , the construction office did not take into account a ruling by its superior body , the Ministry for Regi@@ onal Development , according to which the deadline for the start of a survey had already exp@@ ired .
it was , in any case , a scandal@@ ous procedure .
`` We have been preparing this project for seven@@ teen years , we observe all laws of the Czech Republic and respect all authorities and institutions concerned , '@@ ' said R@@ az@@ et@@ to in a press release .
the project , n@@ ick@@ named the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low due to the fac@@ ade col@@ our allegedly proposed , has provoked strong emotions in Prague .
previously , hundreds of people had gathered to protest against the building .
associations and inhabitants of nearby houses objec@@ ted to the fact that some permits had been issued years ago for a building that looked different .
they also critici@@ sed the un@@ su@@ it@@ ability of the building for the historic Cent@@ re of Prague and the immediate vic@@ in@@ ity of the Con@@ vent of St. Ag@@ nes .
the building was designed by Z@@ den@@ ě@@ k F@@ rá@@ nek , who changed the project several times .
the original form of the project from 2008 , which included a glass fac@@ ade , was rejected by the Ministry of C@@ ulture based on the opinion of the National Her@@ itage Institute -LRB- N@@ HI -RRB- , which also cancel@@ led a permit issued by the Prague Her@@ itage Association .
however , the N@@ HI and the heritage department at the municipal authority approved a new project by Pra@@ ga Pro@@ get@@ ti e In@@ v@@ estim@@ enti fe@@ at@@ uring windo@@ ws in the shape of faces , and it was on this basis that planning permission was issued .
the architect rejected complaints made by opponents , saying that he had never considered a p@@ ink fac@@ ade , which gave the project its n@@ ick@@ name after the p@@ ink and white conf@@ ec@@ tionary .
Czech politician gives migrants a lift
Hung@@ arians put them all in prison .
Ber@@ g went to Hungary to give refugees humanitarian aid .
on the way he and his compani@@ ons picked up three Syrian refugees , whom he allegedly wanted to give a lift for half a kilome@@ tre .
at the time it was n@@ '@@ t yet a criminal off@@ ence , he claimed to Lid@@ ové noviny .
we knew that the police would n@@ '@@ t prosecute us for this .
but when they stopped us , we were surprised when they arrested us and re@@ man@@ ded us in cust@@ ody in S@@ ze@@ ged , he said .
the politician eventually spent nine hours in a cell .
he says that the police behaved properly , but there were communication problems because their English was n@@ '@@ t very good .
however , he says that the prison was miser@@ able .
for example , 15 Syrian refugees were cra@@ mmed in a cell measuring about three by four me@@ tre@@ s .
these included a two year-old boy and a four year-old girl .
they had already been in the cell for a day and due to the language barrier did n@@ '@@ t know what was going to happen to them , said Ber@@ g .
what can no longer be confis@@ cated ?

Met@@ cash laun@@ ches grassroots campaign to fight Al@@ di incur@@ sion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect its I@@ G@@ A stores from an Al@@ di on@@ slaught in South Australia and Western Australia .
gro@@ cer@@ y wholes@@ al@@ er Met@@ cash has k@@ icked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of I@@ G@@ A re@@ tail@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
as Al@@ di pre@@ pares to open two distribution cent@@ res and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ G@@ A super@@ markets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the I@@ G@@ A brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the A@@ dela@@ ide show .
I@@ G@@ A re@@ tail@@ ers and suppliers are ju@@ mping on board , with brands such as D@@ un@@ s@@ bo@@ rough@@ -based ice cre@@ am maker S@@ imm@@ o '@@ s offering taste testing at I@@ G@@ A stores and store owners selling dis@@ counted South Australian football league tic@@ kets to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the food , liqu@@ or and hardware wholes@@ al@@ er hosts its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ cash '@@ s I@@ G@@ A store foot@@ print and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ cash '@@ s I@@ G@@ A network in the eastern states .
South Australian and Western Australian sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers are notoriously paro@@ chi@@ al and I@@ G@@ A re@@ tail@@ ers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in N@@ S@@ W , Victor@@ ia and Que@@ en@@ s@@ land - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in wa compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Al@@ di will s@@ n@@ are around 5 per cent of the gro@@ cer@@ y market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent re@@ tail@@ ers .
in a report this week , Morgan Stanley analy@@ st T@@ om Ki@@ er@@ ath estimated that I@@ G@@ A re@@ tail@@ ers could lose $ 3@@ 60 million a year in sales and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in wa next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss of food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales and volumes on Met@@ cash '@@ s high fixed-@@ cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Co@@ les , even though a recent Ro@@ y Morgan survey found I@@ G@@ A sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers were most loyal .
Morgan Stanley believes Met@@ cash '@@ s food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales will fall 3.@@ 8 per cent in 2016 , 4.@@ 1 per cent in 20@@ 17 and 2.@@ 1 per cent in 20@@ 18 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 1@@ 0.3 per cent by 2020 .
last week , leading fund manager Ham@@ ish D@@ ou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ el@@ lan Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash could `` highly , probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash has declined to respond publicly to Mr D@@ ou@@ glass ' comments .
but it is understood that a Met@@ cash board member cont@@ acted Mr D@@ ou@@ glass last week .
I@@ G@@ A '@@ s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Met@@ cash '@@ s food and gro@@ cer@@ y business , which supplies about 1@@ 200 I@@ G@@ A re@@ tail@@ ers , have fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating de@@ leverage as sales and margins come under pressure .
however , the wholes@@ al@@ er is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year mat@@ ching shel@@ f prices at Co@@ les and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week , helping I@@ G@@ A re@@ tail@@ ers ref@@ ur@@ bi@@ sh stores by adding fa@@ ster@@ -@@ growing fresh food , and rolling out a better range of private label gro@@ cer@@ ies .
Met@@ cash chief executive I@@ an Mor@@ rice says the price mat@@ ching and store ref@@ ur@@ bi@@ shment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholes@@ al@@ er will return to underlying profit growth in 20@@ 17 , for the first time in four years .
T@@ han@@ asi K@@ ok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is backed by ten@@ nis Australia president Ste@@ ve He@@ aly
T@@ han@@ asi K@@ ok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves ku@@ do@@ s rather than criticism for his behavi@@ our .
T@@ han@@ asi K@@ ok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend N@@ ick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves ku@@ do@@ s rather than criticism for his own behavi@@ our , according to ten@@ nis Australia president Ste@@ ve He@@ aly .
K@@ ok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ o regularly referred to as the `` Special K@@ s , '@@ ' was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyr@@ gi@@ os sled@@ ge of St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal M@@ ast@@ ers .
in a fi@@ ery quali@@ fying match in C@@ inc@@ in@@ na@@ ti soon after , K@@ ok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ ris@@ on twice had to be separated by the chair ump@@ ire , with Har@@ ris@@ on declaring : `` Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should '@@ ve dec@@ ked Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should dec@@ k that k@@ id . '@@ '
while he was last seen sma@@ shing a ra@@ c@@ qu@@ et after cra@@ mp fo@@ iled a potential US Open upset of Richard G@@ as@@ qu@@ et , K@@ ok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is has been defended staun@@ ch@@ ly by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Gla@@ s@@ go@@ w , competing with Sam Gro@@ th for the second sing@@ les ber@@ th behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Dav@@ is Cup semi-@@ final against Britain .
`` One thing I do feel quite ke@@ enly about is I think T@@ han@@ asi '@@ s been dragged into the fra@@ y a little bit , '@@ ' He@@ aly said .
he did break a ra@@ c@@ qu@@ et when he lost when he cra@@ mped in the US , but he '@@ s not the first player to break a ra@@ c@@ qu@@ et out of frustration with himself , and I know T@@ han@@ asi well enough to know he would n@@ '@@ t be proud of that .
but , really , he '@@ s handled himself extremely well , in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Har@@ ris@@ on and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of credit .
he '@@ s a great team around him , he '@@ s got a great family around him and I just think he '@@ s been a little hard done by .
he '@@ s a very mature 19@@ -year-old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he has n@@ '@@ t ever had an issue with the other players , he '@@ s well respected in the lo@@ cker room , he tra@@ ins hard , he '@@ s in great shape , he '@@ s a very stable and mature young gu@@ y and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
He@@ aly also backed the decision to overlook Kyr@@ gi@@ os for the important tie , starting on Fri@@ day , describing the `` mutual decision '@@ ' as the right thing for all , but backing the Can@@ ber@@ ran to return as a long-term fix@@ ture in the team .
`` First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around -LSB- Kyr@@ gi@@ os -RSB- , '@@ ' He@@ aly said .
and I think N@@ ick , he '@@ s risen very quickly , as people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out , he '@@ s growing up in the public eye and he '@@ s made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we '@@ re trying to support him , we '@@ re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the li@@ me@@ light where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it '@@ s best for the team and it '@@ s best for him .
Europe migrant crisis : Hungary decla@@ res emergency , se@@ als border , de@@ tains migrants
declaring a state of emergency , Hungary se@@ aled off its southern border with Serbia on Tu@@ es@@ day and detained those trying to enter illegally , aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in .
chaos ensued at the border , as hundreds of migrants p@@ iled up in a no man '@@ s land , and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries ' chec@@ k@@ points , those fleeing violence in their hom@@ el@@ ands pit@@ ched t@@ ents and settled in .
but frustrations were on the rise .
as a police helicopter h@@ over@@ ed above , migrants chan@@ ted `` Open the border ! '@@ ' and sh@@ ou@@ ted insul@@ ts at Hungarian ri@@ ot police .
some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia '@@ s foreign minister declared it was `` unacceptable '@@ ' that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arri@@ ving from Macedonia and Greece .
-LRB- Serbia -RRB- wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
there will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , '@@ ' I@@ vic@@ a D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the turmoil at the Hung@@ ari@@ an-@@ Serbian border came a day after the 2@@ 8-@@ nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
the ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hop@@ efully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 1@@ 20,000 more refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tu@@ es@@ day for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent '@@ s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , was not p@@ inning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors .
Tu@@ es@@ day '@@ s state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases .
meanwhile , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country is also planning to build a raz@@ or-@@ w@@ ire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country , now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border .
CB@@ S News correspond@@ ent Char@@ lie D@@ '@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison inmates were en@@ listed in the race to finish the raz@@ or w@@ ire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the last few months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ ec@@ k and entry point into the European Union for migrants , many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has insisted that most arri@@ ving are economic migrants seeking a better life , not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations , including Germany .
the new laws that took effect at mid@@ night in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-@@ meter -LRB- 13@@ -@@ foot -RRB- raz@@ or-@@ w@@ ire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers .
`` due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government decla@@ res a state of crisis , '@@ ' government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ ac@@ s told reporters in the southern city of S@@ ze@@ ged .
we are very clear on this : illegal border crossing is a crime .
technically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Pre@@ ss reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ ond@@ i , homeland security adviser to Or@@ ban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country .
they got across by damaging the fence , are now in police cust@@ ody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws .
authorities are quickly repairing the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tu@@ es@@ day morning after deploying a train car covered with raz@@ or w@@ ire to close one of them .
chaos en@@ velop@@ ed the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hung@@ arians opened a tiny office in a metal con@@ tain@@ er to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside .
about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main high@@ way conne@@ cting Serbia and Hungary , saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton '@@ s lead over Ber@@ nie Sand@@ ers cut by half in national poll
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally , but Sen@@ . Ber@@ nie Sand@@ ers is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters -LRB- down from 58 percent -RRB- , while Sand@@ ers comes in second , with 27 percent -LRB- up from 17 percent -RRB- .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
more than five months before the start of the primary con@@ tests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support .
but Clinton '@@ s bac@@ kers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
since last month '@@ s CB@@ S News poll , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups , while Sand@@ ers has made some gains .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates , but those leads have narrowed .
her support among men has dropped considerably and Sand@@ ers only tra@@ ils her by 5 points .
Clinton '@@ s advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has eva@@ pora@@ ted , and she and Sand@@ ers are now even .
however , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of Sand@@ ers by double-@@ dig@@ its among liberals , but Sand@@ ers now has a 5-@@ point edge with this group .
about half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiast@@ ically support Clinton if she became the party '@@ s nominee .
a quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee .
six percent would not support her .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton '@@ s current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her .
views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiast@@ ically support her .
while 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiast@@ ically back Clinton , fewer Republican voters say that about their fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner , Donald trump -LRB- 35 percent -RRB- .
when Clinton '@@ s supporters are asked in an open-@@ ended question why they want her to be the nominee , the top answer is that she has the right experience -LRB- 16 percent -RRB- , followed by it '@@ s time for a woman president -LRB- 13 percent -RRB- , and that she is the best candidate for the job -LRB- 10 percent -RRB- .
also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton -LRB- 9 percent -RRB- .
agreement on the issues , and elec@@ tability are also cited .
as the vice president weigh@@ s a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third do n@@ '@@ t think he should .
when Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party '@@ s nomination , Biden is the top pick .
among Clinton supporters , more than half say Biden would be their second choice , far ahead of Sand@@ ers .
if Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton '@@ s lead over Sand@@ ers widen@@ s , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
Fif@@ ty-@@ five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
Biden is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most elec@@ table has risen .
still , when asked which is more important in a nominee , Democratic voters pick issues over elec@@ tability .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key characteristics among their party '@@ s primary voters .
majorities see Clinton , Sand@@ ers and Biden as honest and trust@@ worthy and as having strong leadership qualities .
Biden does the best of the three on honesty , while Clinton '@@ s strength is leadership .
thirty percent of Democratic primary voters do n@@ '@@ t think Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many as say that about Sand@@ ers -LRB- 15 percent -RRB- , but 27 percent do n@@ '@@ t have an opinion of him on this .
democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , Sand@@ ers and Biden as in line with their views ideologically .
on all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sand@@ ers .
as questions continue about Hillary Clinton '@@ s use of a personal em@@ ail address and serv@@ er while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it has n@@ '@@ t imp@@ acted their overall views of her .
but it '@@ s a different story among the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with her explanation , while just about a third are satisfied .
the public '@@ s views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
most Americans say the em@@ ail controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
it is mainly Republicans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trust@@ worthy by her party '@@ s voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and trust@@ worthy , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
Six@@ ty-@@ two percent of registered voters do n@@ '@@ t think of her as honest and trust@@ worthy .
at the same time , 55 percent of registered voters nationwide do n@@ '@@ t see trump as honest and trust@@ worthy either .
both Clinton and trump , however , get good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Biden , Car@@ son and Bush do the best on honesty .
more see Sand@@ ers as honest than not , but like Car@@ son , many do n@@ '@@ t have an opinion of him .
the margin of error for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws close behind Donald trump in national poll
Ben Car@@ son is running close behind Donald trump in the newest CB@@ S New@@ s@@ /@@ New York Times poll
the two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll , leaving others sc@@ ro@@ un@@ ging for a fo@@ o@@ th@@ old
Republican voters nationwide continue to back trump in large numbers , clim@@ bing from 23 % support in the last CB@@ S poll , conducted before the Fox News debate last month , to 27 % in the poll out Tu@@ es@@ day .
but Car@@ son rocke@@ ted in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also found Car@@ son doing well across demographic groups , ed@@ ging out trump among colle@@ ge@@ -@@ educated Republican voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly F@@ ior@@ ina and O@@ hi@@ o G@@ ov@@ . John K@@ asi@@ ch , has sli@@ pped behind with W@@ is@@ con@@ sin G@@ ov@@ . Scot@@ t Wal@@ ker falling far@@ the@@ st from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
former Florida G@@ ov@@ . Je@@ b Bush , former Ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as G@@ ov@@ . Mi@@ ke Hu@@ c@@ ka@@ be@@ e and Florida Sen@@ . Mar@@ co Ru@@ bi@@ o all tied for third place with 6 % .
the margin of error for the 3@@ 7@@ 6-@@ person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is p@@ lus@@ -@@ or-@@ minus 6 % , and was conducted Sep@@ t .
the latest CN@@ N@@ /@@ OR@@ C survey , released last week , showed Car@@ son rising in the polls -- landing at 19 % support among Republicans , behind trump '@@ s 32 % support .
the latest poll from A@@ BC New@@ s@@ /@@ Washington Post also showed trump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
facing a rising Car@@ son last week , trump took some pot@@ sh@@ ots at the retired neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on , even as Car@@ son apologized for questioning trump '@@ s faith .

nearly two years after a college student died during a frater@@ nity ha@@ zing ritual in Pen@@ n@@ sylvania '@@ s Po@@ con@@ o mountains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
members of New York City '@@ s Bar@@ u@@ ch College P@@ i Del@@ ta P@@ S@@ I frater@@ nity brutally assa@@ ulted Ch@@ un `` Michael '@@ ' Deng during an initi@@ ation rit@@ e in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
officials said he was blin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded , sad@@ dled with a 30-@@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field .
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell un@@ conscious .
P@@ i Del@@ ta P@@ S@@ I frater@@ nity members did not call 9@@ 11 after Deng passed out , and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
they did , however , find time to change Deng '@@ s clothes , Google his symptoms , and contact An@@ dy M@@ eng , the frater@@ nity '@@ s national president to seek advice , Poli@@ ce Chief Ch@@ ris W@@ ag@@ ner said at a news conference .
`` At this point , members began to hide parap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and basically put the frater@@ nity '@@ s well-being over that of Michael Deng '@@ s , '@@ ' Chief W@@ ag@@ ner said .
he could not be revived and he died the next morning .
according to an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head , tor@@ so , and th@@ igh@@ s .
`` To@@ o many families have been devastated as a result of frater@@ nity ha@@ zing , with at least one student dying every year from ha@@ zing since 1970 , '@@ ' D@@ ou@@ gla@@ s Fi@@ er@@ berg , an at@@ tor@@ ney representing Deng '@@ s family , said in a statement .
Fra@@ ter@@ ni@@ ties and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
a Mon@@ ro@@ e Coun@@ ty grand jury recommended third-@@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
Thir@@ ty-@@ two other frater@@ nity members , including Mr. M@@ eng , will also be charged with assault ha@@ zing and criminal conspiracy .
`` We want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there '@@ s an organization that sanctioned it , whether officially or uno@@ ff@@ ici@@ ally , we '@@ re going to hold them accountable as well , '@@ ' W@@ ag@@ ner said at a news conference Tu@@ es@@ day .
Bar@@ u@@ ch College banned the frater@@ nity and the national frater@@ nity revo@@ ked its affili@@ ation with the local chapter .
here '@@ s what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
a rate hike will come and the bul@@ l market will stum@@ ble , bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession .
this we know .
what we do n@@ '@@ t know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
a recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months .
the Federal Reserve '@@ s aggres@@ siveness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
that '@@ s why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to norm@@ alize .
there are , indeed , multiple variables at play .
in the end , however , market participants may find that all the ra@@ te-@@ hike fus@@ s may have been over@@ done .
`` The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of ` cheap money , ' `` Juli@@ an J@@ ess@@ op , chief global economist at Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the se@@ ism@@ ic shock that many seem to fear .
that '@@ s not to say there wo n@@ '@@ t be effects , however .
here '@@ s a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
once the hike hits , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
`` It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12@@ -@@ 24 months after the first hike , which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy , '@@ ' Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes .
more specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days after -LRB- average gain of 2.@@ 6 percent -RRB- then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cycles of 1@@ 4.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis B@@ ob dol@@ l , chief equity strategi@@ st at Nu@@ ve@@ en As@@ set Management , post@@ ed on Bar@@ ron '@@ s .
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the ra@@ te-@@ hi@@ king cycle and returns begin to diminish .
recessions are a fact of economic life , but rate hikes often help them along .
in the current case , the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could ha@@ sten a recession .
most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike .
according to Deutsche Bank , in the 1@@ 18 rate hikes since 1950 , only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent , according to the A@@ tl@@ anta Fed .
hi@@ king rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of `` whether this time is different , '@@ ' Deutsche said .
market participants have been bra@@ cing for a Fed hike all year , with all eyes turned toward this week '@@ s Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which ends T@@ hur@@ sday .
while many strategists and economists believe the F@@ O@@ M@@ C could approve a hike at this meeting , futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability .
`` In our study since 1950 , all hi@@ king cycles to date have been in a sup@@ er cycle of increasing leverage with GDP ec@@ li@@ p@@ sing prer@@ ec@@ ession pe@@ aks very quickly post the recovery commen@@ cing , '@@ ' the report said .
by contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
the current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
fixed income also has been volatile as the market anti@@ cip@@ ates a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience .
the principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy .
for bonds , it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hi@@ ke@@ /@@ cut in the cycle arrives .
at the end of the hi@@ king cycle bond yields fall immediately , '@@ ' Deutsche said .
Charles Sch@@ w@@ ab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer@@ - and shor@@ ter-@@ dated bonds to move closer together , flat@@ tening the cur@@ ve .
high-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though `` we are still cautious about stret@@ ching for yield , '@@ ' Ka@@ thy Jones , fixed income analy@@ st at Sch@@ w@@ ab , said in an analysis .
interestingly , Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations .
`` In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , '@@ ' she wrote .
short-term interest rates are up , the yield cur@@ ve is f@@ latter , credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tigh@@ tens policy .
broadly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multin@@ ation@@ als with lots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
`` History shows that ` quality ' stocks tend to out@@ perform during the three months following an initial rate hike , '@@ ' Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients .
firms with strong balance sheets out@@ paced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hikes , by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also out@@ performed their lower quality counterparts , by an average of 4 -LRB- percentage points -RRB- and 3 -LRB- percentage points -RRB- , respectively .
debt will become a big issue .
companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most , Goldman said .
outside pure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar .
savers could see gains as well through higher yields at the , though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold .
BBC R@@ adi@@ o 3 is a copy of Cla@@ ss@@ ic F@@ M says M@@ P Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
conservative M@@ P Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham critici@@ sed station for ` du@@ m@@ bing down '
argues it '@@ s becoming increasingly in@@ distingui@@ shable from commercial rival
also took aim at the BBC Mus@@ ic A@@ wards , saying they just ri@@ p off the Br@@ its
colleague Dam@@ i@@ en Col@@ lin@@ s M@@ P attacked The Vo@@ ice , saying that too was n@@ '@@ t original
BBC R@@ adi@@ o 3 is `` turning into '@@ ' Cla@@ ss@@ ic F@@ M , a leading M@@ P has claimed , p@@ iling fresh pressure on the broad@@ ca@@ ster to prove that it does something that commercial broad@@ ca@@ sters do not .
conservative M@@ P Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be `` du@@ m@@ bing down '@@ ' and is becoming increasingly in@@ distingui@@ shable from its commercial rival .
`` R@@ adi@@ o 3 seems to be - I do n@@ '@@ t like to use the word `` du@@ m@@ bing down '@@ ' - but it seems to be turning into Cla@@ ss@@ ic F@@ M , '@@ ' he said .
he also took aim at the BBC Mus@@ ic A@@ wards , launched last December .
the BBC Mus@@ ic A@@ wards which started last year seem to be the Br@@ its by another name .
so , if you '@@ re trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you '@@ re actually just mim@@ icking what is already on the market , '@@ ' Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC director general denied the charges , arguing that BBC R@@ adi@@ o 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public .
what I learn from R@@ adi@@ o 3 , I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else .
and it '@@ s commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
`` And also , R@@ adi@@ o 3 '@@ s commitment to finding new music and commis@@ sion@@ ing new works I think is also really important , '@@ ' he said .
earlier this year , BBC R@@ adi@@ o 3 control@@ ler Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past , because Brit@@ ons are less educated about classical music .
however , R@@ adi@@ o 3 was not the only element of the BBC '@@ s output which came under fire for tre@@ ading on the to@@ es of commercial rivals , during the C@@ ulture , Media and sport select committee hearing .
T@@ ory M@@ P Dam@@ i@@ en Col@@ lin@@ s attacked The Vo@@ ice - the mus@@ ical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of £ 2@@ 2@@ million .
can you see why that program@@ me is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive ?
Lord H@@ all insisted that the B@@ B@@ C@@ 1 show - which stars Pal@@ oma F@@ ai@@ th and Bo@@ y George as judges - was produced `` in a particularly BBC way . '@@ '
he added that he wants the Corporation to `` find a hit from our own in-@@ house stable '@@ ' next time it laun@@ ches an entertainment series .
however , he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Vo@@ ice in the future , or spending L@@ ic@@ ence fee pay@@ ers ' money on other entertainment form@@ ats .
Internet sales increased at slo@@ west ever rate in August and Black Fri@@ day may be to blame
first three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
experts believe November '@@ s Black Fri@@ day could be holding back spending
for over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain '@@ s high streets into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales are le@@ veling off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
experts say there are signs that online sales are le@@ veling off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
` If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to ration@@ ali@@ se over time , ' An@@ dy Mul@@ ca@@ hy , editor of IM@@ R@@ G sales index , told the Gu@@ ar@@ dian .
he explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers started using their mobile phones to make purchases .
it meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts , such as on the sof@@ a .
but now that is plate@@ au@@ ing a bit , you might see -LRB- growth -RRB- fall away .
the Black Fri@@ day phenomenon , which has been imported from America , is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales .
experts believe sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Fri@@ day in November .
last year five times the average number of sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers flo@@ cked to their computers to sna@@ p up deals cra@@ shing a number of re@@ tail@@ ers web@@ sites .
experts believe Black Fri@@ day , which saw sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers fight over bar@@ gains , could be holding sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers off from making purchases
research published by the British retail Con@@ sor@@ tium found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
for some products , such as T@@ Vs and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online , rather than using high street fashion chains .
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca c@@ ran@@ e crash as Bin Laden family sanctioned
bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first fun@@ er@@ als take place in Mecca
come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Bin@@ lad@@ in Group
the Health Ministry said a total of 3@@ 9@@ 4 people were also injured after the c@@ ran@@ e crashed down
carried al@@ of@@ t through the streets , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a c@@ ran@@ e collapsed at Mecca '@@ s G@@ rand mosque .
dressed largely in white , mour@@ ners pac@@ ked the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-@@ Mo@@ a@@ is@@ sem c@@ em@@ e@@ tery .
the sad possession passed by the holy site , where just days earlier a construction c@@ ran@@ e crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto wor@@ shi@@ p@@ ers .
the bodies were released for fun@@ eral as the Saudi King sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster , which also left 3@@ 9@@ 4 injured .
the bodies of 29 of the wor@@ shi@@ p@@ ers killed when a c@@ ran@@ e crashed collapsed at Mecca '@@ s G@@ rand Central Mos@@ que were carried through the streets
among the dead was fa@@ ther@@ -of-@@ four Q@@ asi@@ m A@@ kra@@ m , from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchest@@ er , who was on his first pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge when the c@@ ran@@ e crashed down .
Mr A@@ kra@@ m had been in the G@@ rand Mos@@ que with his parents ahead of the start of the annual H@@ aj@@ j pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge .
Saudi officials have already vowed that the H@@ aj@@ j to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descen@@ d on the city .
today , King Sal@@ man said the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group should not have left the c@@ ran@@ e '@@ s arm up when it was not in use .
an Arabic version of the decre@@ e , carried by the state-@@ run Saudi Pre@@ ss Agency , said the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group was partly to blame for the collapse .
the news agency '@@ s English service did not report that detail , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travel@@ ling abroad .
earlier this week Sal@@ man vowed to reveal what caused the c@@ ran@@ e to topple into a cour@@ ty@@ ard of the G@@ rand Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have conver@@ ged ahead of the H@@ aj@@ j pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge later this month .
Bin@@ lad@@ in Group has not released any statements about the c@@ ran@@ e collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment .
the royal decre@@ e also blamed the group for not using up@@ -to-@@ date safety measures and failing to coordinate with Me@@ te@@ oro@@ logical officials .
dozens of c@@ ran@@ es surround Mecca '@@ s G@@ rand Mos@@ que , part of the massive construction effort headed by the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group .
the Bin@@ lad@@ in family has been close to Saudi Arabia '@@ s ruling family for decades and runs major building projects .
Al Qaida '@@ s late leader Osama bin Laden was a rene@@ g@@ ade son di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by the family in the 1990s .
the crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge , which is required at least once in the life of every able-@@ bod@@ ied Muslim .
officials said 15@@ 8 people remain in hospital .
officials ordered one million ri@@ y@@ als -LRB- £ 17@@ 4@@ ,000 -RRB- be paid to the relatives of those killed , and the same amount to those permanently injured .
others injured will receive half that amount .
B & Q boss says Eastern European trade@@ smen working cheap is behind trend
Brit@@ ons are increasingly employing han@@ dy@@ men says Ver@@ oni@@ que La@@ ury
number of skilled trade@@ smen from Eastern Europe behind rise
resulting in 200 more S@@ cre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at trade@@ smen , opening
at same time K@@ ing@@ fi@@ sher is closing 60 B & Q outlets across the country
by Rup@@ ert Stein@@ er , Chief City correspond@@ ent for the Daily Ma@@ il
Brit@@ ons are said to be putting down their ham@@ m@@ ers and pa@@ int@@ bru@@ shes in fav@@ our of employing skilled Eastern European trade@@ smen to carry out work in their home
if you are han@@ dy with a ham@@ mer or a wh@@ iz@@ z at pain@@ ting walls , it seems you are in the minority these days .
because Brit@@ ons are increasingly employing han@@ dy@@ men to carry out DI@@ Y jobs in their homes , according to the boss of the company behind B & Q .
Ver@@ oni@@ que La@@ ury , new chief executive of K@@ ing@@ fi@@ sher , which ow@@ ns the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of skilled trade@@ smen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock@@ -@@ bottom prices is behind the trend .
as a result , K@@ ing@@ fi@@ sher is planning to open 200 more S@@ cre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at trade@@ smen , while closing 60 B & Q outlets .
M@@ rs La@@ ury said she wants more women to be employed in B & Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex .
currently the majority of staff are men .
she said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
M@@ rs La@@ ury said : `` We still have a majority of men working in our stores .
we need to move more towards a balance .
fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women .
women play a big part in the decision-making process .
M@@ rs La@@ ury , who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain '@@ s FT@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading firms , has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors .
K@@ ing@@ fi@@ sher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
M@@ rs La@@ ury said : `` This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
K@@ ing@@ fi@@ sher post@@ ed a fall in both half-@@ year profit and sales after the group shoul@@ dered the cost of sh@@ utting stores .
as a result of the trend K@@ ing@@ fi@@ sher , which ow@@ ns S@@ cre@@ w@@ fix and B & Q , is opening 200 new stores
December allow@@ ance of 600 crow@@ ns to pensioners under threat
`` It is the justice of equal stom@@ ach@@ s , it has nothing to do with human justice , '@@ ' said top 0@@ 9 deputy chairman Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Kal@@ ou@@ sek , who emphasi@@ sed the principle of deser@@ ved@@ ness .
O@@ DS parliamentary party leader Z@@ by@@ ně@@ k Stan@@ j@@ ura noted that , while the one-@@ off payment soun@@ ded good , in the long-term it would be better if it were part of the standard adjustment , as it would then be felt in years ahead .
`` We have space to find a mechanism to set it up , '@@ ' stated Stan@@ ju@@ ra@@ ,
who supported the original proposal of Minister Micha@@ ela Mar@@ k@@ s@@ ová -LRB- Č@@ SS@@ D -RRB- , according to which adjustment beyond the requirements of the law was to take place next year .
Mar@@ k@@ s@@ ová defended the additional amount , arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners , which she says is not a good one .
Mar@@ k@@ s@@ ová stated that higher adjustment next year would mean an impact of 5.@@ 5 billion crow@@ ns on the budget , with ministers fighting over every hundred million .
Prime Minister B@@ oh@@ us@@ la@@ v S@@ ob@@ ot@@ ka -LRB- Č@@ SS@@ D -RRB- reminded the right-wing parties that in the past they had lowered the adjustment rate .
Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v O@@ pál@@ ka -LRB- K@@ S@@ Č@@ M -RRB- highlighted the fact that the proposal does not discuss the reduction of actual pensions in 2016 and later .
the right-wing parties ' veto significantly complic@@ ates payment in December and will maybe even prevent it , he said .
the Č@@ SS@@ D '@@ s parliamentary party leader Roman Sk@@ len@@ á@@ k therefore proposed the shor@@ tening of the deadline for the committee discussion of the standard to ten or twenty days ; this , too , was blocked by the right-wing parties .
however , the committee will have one month , rather than the usual two , for the discussion .
the bonus should cost the state a total of 1.@@ 73 billion crow@@ ns .
money is to be chiefly taken from the budgets of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs .
next year pensions should rise by an average of approximately one hundred crow@@ ns .
according to this amend@@ ment to pension law , the sum is to be received by people who are entitled to a pension , or part there@@ of , in December .
it would also be available to those whose entitlement to a pension exp@@ ired in December , before its payment .
they would have to apply for the payment in writing , no later than by the end of next year .
pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly adjusted in January by the amount of the rise in prices and a third of the rise in actual salaries .
this year , pensions cor@@ respond to 4@@ 1.5 percent of gross salaries , and next year this would be 4@@ 0.5 percent .
according to the state '@@ s closing account , last year the state spent 3@@ 1@@ 4.@@ 7 billion crow@@ ns on old-@@ age pensions , a year-@@ on-@@ year increase of approximately 5.@@ 5 billion crow@@ ns .
expenditure on old-@@ age pensions represented 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all expenditure required by law .
according to data contained in the state closing account , the average full old-@@ age pension last year grew by 10@@ 4 crow@@ ns to 1@@ 0,@@ 7@@ 14 crow@@ ns .
the Czech Social Security Administration paid out 2.4 million full old-@@ age pensions and around 17@@ ,000 pro-@@ ra@@ ta pensions .
Y@@ ak@@ un@@ in aband@@ ons plans for a political career , will devote himself to science .
according to Russian media , the billion@@ aire was virtually assured of a Senate seat .
he was to represent the western Kaliningrad Ob@@ last , whose governor , Ni@@ ko@@ lay T@@ su@@ kan@@ ov , defended his mandate as the candidate for ruling party United Russia in Sunday '@@ s elections , in the Russian Federation Council .
according to Russian law , senators are not elected by the public , but are chosen by the governor from three candidates , whose names are announced before guber@@ na@@ tori@@ al elections .
the governor then chooses the candidates themselves after the elections .
one complic@@ ation for Y@@ ak@@ un@@ in was the fact that he has not lived in the Kaliningrad Ob@@ last for twenty years , as required by law .
the Kremlin had , though , granted Y@@ ak@@ un@@ in an exemp@@ tion on the grounds that he was an extraordinary and auth@@ or@@ ised pl@@ eni@@ poten@@ ti@@ ary to whom the legal requirement for long-term resid@@ ency did not apply .
shooting of the Czech com@@ edy Te@@ orie tyg@@ ra -LRB- The@@ ory of the Tig@@ er -RRB- has concluded
the final stra@@ w for the resolution of the main character is the voluntary death of his fa@@ ther@@ -in-@@ law , who has lost strength and patience .
the grand@@ mother -LRB- I@@ va Jan@@ ž@@ u@@ rová -RRB- made the decisions on the grand@@ father '@@ s life , old age and fun@@ eral .
Jan can see that he is going the same way with his wife Ol@@ ga -LRB- E@@ liš@@ ka Bal@@ zer@@ ová -RRB- .
he re@@ members that once he had his own will and dreams , and wants to live a free , dig@@ ni@@ fied life .
he wants to take back control over his life - and his solution is to run away from the one he has , says S@@ la@@ ví@@ k about the story .
B@@ aj@@ g@@ ar wanted to use the com@@ edy form to capture a certain type of relationship , in which one of the partners does n@@ '@@ t live a totally free life .
B@@ aj@@ g@@ ar says that it was clear from the start that Bar@@ to@@ ška , with whom he had previously worked on the series N@@ evi@@ di@@ tel@@ ní , would have the main role .
despite this , he says that the actor , who was appearing in front of the cameras after a long break caused due to con@@ val@@ esc@@ ence from a serious illness , surprised him .
we agreed on this three years ago .
I let him read the script and he said that he liked the sad@@ ness of it .
and he surprised me by saying that he was a clo@@ set athle@@ te .
in the past he would always ask where he would sit before fil@@ ming the next scene .
back then he would cycle , climb up ro@@ cks , and even hike up h@@ ills -
all of this in record tropical temperatures , adds the director .
according to Bar@@ to@@ ška , women mar@@ ry ti@@ gers so that over time they can make rab@@ bits out of them .
they give them some feed , then immediately close the door so that they do n@@ '@@ t think of playing the tiger outside the rab@@ bit h@@ ut@@ ch .
that '@@ s what we '@@ re trying to convey in our film , says the actor .
his wife , who may come across to audiences as a slightly negative character , is played by E@@ liš@@ ka Bal@@ zer@@ ová .
she is n@@ '@@ t only a negative character .
she '@@ s also good@@ -@@ na@@ tured , intelligent , em@@ pathetic and has good intentions .
at the same time she '@@ s a us@@ ur@@ per and wants to co@@ ok him to death , adds B@@ aj@@ g@@ ar .
the film tells the parallel story of Jan '@@ s married daughters O@@ lin@@ ka and A@@ len@@ ka -LRB- T@@ á@@ ň@@ a Vil@@ hel@@ mov@@ á and Pavla Ber@@ et@@ ová -RRB- and son@@ s-@@ in-@@ law E@@ rik and P@@ ep@@ ík -LRB- Ji@@ ří Hav@@ el@@ ka and J@@ aku@@ b Koh@@ á@@ k -RRB- .

Azerbaijan cancel@@ s part of T@@ eli@@ čka '@@ s visit due to criticism of human rights bre@@ aches
Czech European M@@ P Pavel T@@ eli@@ čka -LRB- AN@@ O -RRB- has postponed his journey to Bak@@ u on T@@ hur@@ sday after the Azerbaijan authorities today cancel@@ led the official part of his visit .
according to T@@ eli@@ čka , Bak@@ u did this following last week '@@ s resolution of the European Parliament critici@@ sing human rights bre@@ aches , of which T@@ eli@@ čka was a co-@@ author .
the Azerbaijan government '@@ s decision means that T@@ eli@@ čka will not have the opportunity to talk to official partners or visit political prisoners , which depends on the consent of the authorities , his Brussels office explained in a press release .
T@@ eli@@ čka had wanted to use the trip , planned several months in advance , to meet parliamentary leaders and representatives of the executive , as well as representatives of the democratic opposition , dissidents and political prisoners , stated the text sent to the Czech Pre@@ ss Office .
the European Parliament resolution condem@@ ns the `` unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan . '@@ '
the resolution calls on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians , officials and judges involved in political persecution .
the resolution was passed shortly after the recent sent@@ encing of opposition journalist K@@ had@@ ij@@ a Is@@ may@@ il@@ ova , who campaigned against corruption in government .
Russia does n@@ '@@ t rule out building air base in Syria .
on a visit to Nov@@ osi@@ bir@@ sk , B@@ og@@ dan@@ ov@@ sky did not rule out Russia building an air base in Syria in the future .
we do not have any such plans at this point in time .
however , nothing is ruled out , he stated .
Russia has already operated a sea base in Tar@@ tus for years , which it so far used as more of a servicing and log@@ istics Cent@@ re .
however , according to reports in the Russian press , supplies of Russian arms and military material have increased since the beginning of August .
according to Moscow these are weapons shi@@ p@@ ments deri@@ ving from valid trade agreements .
the Pentagon claims that the Russians are planning to set up an air base by the town of L@@ ak@@ ati@@ ya , which is , for the time being , a bastion of support for Syrian president Bashar Assad .
however , Washington is n@@ '@@ t entirely clear about Russia '@@ s specific military intentions in Syria , agree American commentators .
US Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the situation in Syria on M@@ ond@@ ay with his Russian counterpart Sergei L@@ av@@ rov . it was their third telephone conversation in the last ten days .
next week Israeli premier Biny@@ amin Netanyahu will visit Moscow to convey his country '@@ s concern about the stock@@ p@@ iling of a Russian arsenal close to the Israeli border .
white House spokes@@ man Jo@@ sh ear@@ nest called Moscow '@@ s support for Assad as a lost bet .
he stated that Russia '@@ s goals in Syria are unclear
and that Russia had made Syria a satellite state .
this may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a more long-term goal , the nature of which was not , according to ear@@ nest , clear .
according to speculation today , the war in Syria may be the main topic of Putin '@@ s speech to the upcoming meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York .
on the other hand , the Russian leader apparently does not intend to mention the situation in the Don@@ bas@@ s , Ukraine at all .
according to today '@@ s report in The New York Times , the American government does n@@ '@@ t rule out President Barack Obama meeting with the Russian president during the UN session .
there is , however , a difference of opinion among White House advisers .
refer@@ ring to the words of Kremlin spokes@@ man Dmitry Pe@@ sk@@ ov , the T@@ A@@ S@@ S agency today wrote that Putin '@@ s schedule for his stay in New York does not currently include a meeting with Obama .
use S@@ es@@ ame oil for a gal@@ l-@@ b@@ lad@@ der diet - hem@@ p oil helps to strengthen immunity .
a good way to increase the transfer of beneficial un@@ s@@ atu@@ rated fat@@ ty aci@@ ds from these fruits is to use extra vir@@ gin o@@ ils .
the re@@ tention of all healthy substan@@ ces in the oil during col@@ d-@@ pressing from seeds
means that these o@@ ils are also suitable as a component of healthy diet , including for g@@ all b@@ lad@@ ders .
some extra vir@@ gin o@@ ils are suitable for the prevention of car@@ diov@@ asc@@ ular disease
which , according to the Czech Institute of Health In@@ formation and Sta@@ tist@@ ics , is the long-term most common cause of death in the Czech Republic .
In@@ fla@@ m@@ mation of the g@@ all b@@ lad@@ der mainly affects women , but S@@ es@@ ame oil helps .
if you '@@ re a lover of Asian cu@@ is@@ ine , S@@ es@@ ame oil , an important part of original Asian recipes , should n@@ '@@ t be missing from your pan@@ try .
unlike the majority of other o@@ ils , it can be used in the preparation of hot di@@ shes and has a number of effects that are beneficial to one '@@ s health .
it often occurs in gal@@ l-@@ b@@ lad@@ der di@@ ets .
S@@ es@@ ame oil contains essential fat@@ ty aci@@ ds that help prevent gal@@ l@@ stones .
90 % of gal@@ l@@ stones are caused by infla@@ m@@ mation of the g@@ all b@@ lad@@ der , a problem that affects women three times more than it does men .
G@@ all-@@ b@@ lad@@ der issues generally affect people who are over@@ weight , do n@@ '@@ t take part in sport and consume a lot of animal fats .
S@@ es@@ ame oil is also a very good component of a liver diet , which is very similar to a g@@ all b@@ lad@@ der one .
to enjoy the full benefits of consuming S@@ es@@ ame oil , be careful about which exotic fo@@ od@@ stu@@ ffs you buy .
products from Asia often use excessively ro@@ ast@@ ed seeds , which usually have a stronger taste .
in the words of Lad@@ islav H@@ ač@@ ecký , CEO of B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia O@@ le@@ j from Kra@@ sli@@ ce near So@@ kol@@ ov , a producer of col@@ d-@@ pressed bi@@ o vir@@ gin oil , o@@ ils prepared in this way lose their effective substan@@ ces .
the company has recently started producing S@@ es@@ ame oil and uses only non-@@ ro@@ ast@@ ed white S@@ es@@ ame seeds .
our seed press presses 8 kil@@ os of S@@ es@@ ame seeds per hour .
our products are mechan@@ ically pressed at a temperature not exceeding 40 degrees and thus meet the conditions for extra vir@@ gin oil .
higher temperatures would entail a loss of nut@@ riti@@ ous substan@@ ces .
Sun@@ f@@ lower oil has benefits for those suffering from heart and circu@@ la@@ tory disease .
the most popular oil in the Czech Republic is sun@@ f@@ lower oil .
a study conducted by J@@ arm@@ ila H@@ amer@@ ská -LRB- Mas@@ ar@@ y@@ kova univerzita , Br@@ no -RRB- found that 43 % of respondents preferred sun@@ f@@ lower oil when cooking .
Sun@@ f@@ lower is not , however , suitable for cooking , as it starts to over@@ heat at 180 ° C .
it '@@ s better for e.g. seas@@ oning sal@@ ads and as part of controlled diet , where it helps prevent car@@ diov@@ asc@@ ular dise@@ a@@ se@@ ,
as it contains a high proportion of ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 6 non-@@ s@@ atu@@ rated fat@@ ty aci@@ ds , which reduce cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol the most out of all fat@@ ty aci@@ ds .
if you have heart problems , take care about the amount of fat and cal@@ ories you consume .
for example , one te@@ as@@ po@@ on@@ ful of sun@@ f@@ lower oil contains 62 cal@@ ories , and one te@@ as@@ po@@ on@@ ful of ra@@ pe@@ seed oil contains 99 cal@@ ories .
as far as energy values are concerned , it is important to re@@ ali@@ se that natural fo@@ od@@ stu@@ ffs containing nut@@ riti@@ ous substan@@ ces are much better than what are known as empty cal@@ ori@@ es@@ ,
which you will find in industri@@ ally process@@ ed products .
we therefore recommend using extra vir@@ gin o@@ ils .
like S@@ es@@ ame oil and hem@@ p oil , sun@@ f@@ lower oil has a life@@ span of nine months .
life@@ span can be extended through fri@@ d@@ ge storage .
old oil can mainly be recog@@ n@@ ised from its bitter taste .
on the other hand , clou@@ d@@ iness at the bottom is not a defec@@ t ;
it '@@ s a sign that the product has not been chem@@ ically refin@@ ed .
H@@ em@@ p oil contains the highest quantity of healthy aci@@ ds .
their extremely high ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 and ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 6 un@@ s@@ atu@@ rated fat@@ ty acid content means that seeds of properly cultivated hem@@ p are one of the so-called super@@ foods
and hem@@ p oil is therefore regarded as the heal@@ thiest veget@@ able oil .
the human body can not produce these essential fat@@ ty aci@@ ds by itself and must be absorbed from food .
the consumption of ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 fat@@ ty acid is of particular importance .
a scientific study published in the European Journal of clinical Science proved that daily in@@ take of this substance is insufficient .
mal@@ es in France and Greece consume 0.6 gra@@ m@@ mes per day , while mal@@ es in Iceland consume 2.5 gra@@ m@@ mes per day .
the recommended daily allow@@ ance is 1-@@ 4 gra@@ m@@ mes .
it is recommended to include hem@@ p as a subsidiary part of your diet for the strengthening of immunity and the healing of wounds .
H@@ em@@ p oil has anti-@@ infla@@ m@@ mat@@ ory effects and is an essential component of cell memb@@ ran@@ es .
H@@ em@@ p oil does not contain any psycho@@ active substan@@ ces .
B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia O@@ le@@ j sells 500 L of oil per year , confir@@ ming its
appeal to consumers .
users often consume one te@@ as@@ po@@ on@@ ful on an empty stomach in the morning .
while it does n@@ '@@ t have a strong taste , hem@@ p oil strengthens immunity , says Daniel V@@ l@@ ček from B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia O@@ le@@ j .
according to statistics , America is the most passionate nation about gr@@ ill@@ ing@@ ,
with 1.4 gr@@ ills per household .
a wide variety of gr@@ illing competi@@ tions take place all over the world , only confir@@ ming the success of this cul@@ inary discipline .
the Czechs have nothing to be ash@@ amed of here either .
based on consumer surveys of the Czech market , only 4 % of people have never gr@@ il@@ led .
the majority g@@ rill several times a year .
for gr@@ illing to work , preparation is important - ideally meat should be mar@@ in@@ aded for several hours before cooking .
which oil is the most suitable for this , while retaining healthy substan@@ ces during gr@@ illing ?
generally one should n@@ '@@ t use too much fat during the gr@@ illing itself .
experts agree that the majority of o@@ ils start to lose their taste at high temper@@ atu@@ res@@ ,
meaning that healthy extra vir@@ gin o@@ ils lose the body of the healthy substan@@ ces that we otherwise gain when consuming oil from foods prepared at lower temperatures .
however , this does n@@ '@@ t mean that extra vir@@ gin o@@ ils lose their value when gr@@ il@@ led .
Gra@@ pe oil for gr@@ illing , health and beauty
when you say ` meat ' , the experts from B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia O@@ le@@ j from Kra@@ sli@@ ce near So@@ kol@@ ov think of gra@@ pe oil .
it '@@ s a great supplement to meat and fish .
in cooking it distinguishes itself with its unique ability to enhance the fla@@ v@@ our of food .
due its high combu@@ stion point of 2@@ 16 ° C it '@@ s also suitable for f@@ rying and gr@@ illing .
in the words of Daniel V@@ l@@ ček from B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia O@@ le@@ j , one of the few Czech companies to produce gra@@ pe oil , this high does combu@@ stion point does not , however , mean that it loses its essential substan@@ ces - one of the few o@@ ils to do so .
experts agree that gra@@ pe oil is fifty times more effective than vitamin E and twenty times more effective than vitamin C .
it further contains a large quantity of lin@@ oli@@ v acid and is thus effective in the fight against cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol .
Gra@@ pe oil is also an important source of un@@ s@@ atu@@ rated fat@@ ty aci@@ ds , vitam@@ ins and miner@@ als .
the high quantities of these substan@@ ces helps reduce high blood pressure , increases me@@ tab@@ oli@@ sm and has positive effects on the kid@@ ne@@ ys .
the consumption of gra@@ pe oil also helps increase external beauty , improving skin ela@@ st@@ icity , helping to fight ac@@ ne and in the care of dry , brit@@ tle hair .
Ch@@ efs highly praise the use of gra@@ pe oil in cooking .
not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold di@@ shes , for example the seas@@ oning of sal@@ ads , it can also be used for hot di@@ shes .
when gr@@ illing it can be used in two ways , for mar@@ ination and gr@@ illing itself .
the mar@@ ination of meat and fish pre@@ serves their ju@@ ic@@ iness .
three components are required in the preparation of mar@@ in@@ ades : oil , a@@ cid@@ ity and seas@@ oning .
A@@ cid@@ ity is added through the use of e.g. ap@@ ple v@@ ine@@ g@@ ar , which helps to soften the meat .
S@@ eas@@ oning gives the meat taste and oil con@@ serves it and gives it the right bite , advis@@ es Daniel V@@ l@@ ček .
he adds that gra@@ pe oil is ideal for mar@@ ination because it is one of the few o@@ ils that penetra@@ tes red meat .
so your mar@@ in@@ aded meat or fish is ready for gr@@ illing - what next ?
extra vir@@ gin o@@ ils are distinguished by the fact that only a few drops are required for the preparation of foods .
the same applies to gr@@ illing .
some o@@ ils must not be used for this type of food preparation .
these include lin@@ seed , hem@@ p and ra@@ pe@@ seed oil , which should n@@ '@@ t be heated at all .
s@@ prin@@ kle the gra@@ te with oil before gr@@ illing to prevent the burning of food .
side orders are also an essential part of gr@@ illing .
practically anything goes with gr@@ il@@ led meat and fish - gr@@ il@@ led veget@@ ables , ro@@ ast@@ ed bread , light veget@@ able sal@@ ad and many more .
the ch@@ efs at B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia O@@ le@@ j recommend , for example , hot Summ@@ er sal@@ ad .
for this , you need : • 1 pe@@ ach • 1 bun@@ ch of rocket • 1 cup@@ ful chop@@ ped cu@@ cum@@ ber • 1 c@@ up mixed let@@ tu@@ ce leaves • 3 tab@@ le@@ spo@@ on@@ ful@@ s of gra@@ pe oil
put the torn rocket , chop@@ ped cu@@ cum@@ ber and large ch@@ un@@ ks of pe@@ ach into a sal@@ ad bo@@ wl .
add salt and pe@@ p@@ per to taste , as well as ground ch@@ ili and so@@ y sa@@ u@@ ce if desired .
add a few drops of gra@@ pe oil to finish .
s@@ prin@@ kle with fin@@ ely chop@@ ped al@@ mon@@ ds for an exceptional taste .
multiple scler@@ os@@ is : it '@@ s not just about the medication , but also about the patient '@@ s will to fight .
multiple scler@@ os@@ is is a complicated disease and people with this diagnosis need consultation from a number of specialists : neuro@@ log@@ ists , physi@@ other@@ ap@@ ists , er@@ go@@ therap@@ ists , u@@ ro@@ log@@ ists , oph@@ th@@ al@@ mo@@ log@@ ists , psychologists , psychiatri@@ sts and many more .
it is not , however , just about therapeutic treatment - for example , women with multiple scler@@ os@@ is also need consultation if they decide to have children , as the care of these patients also includes consultation in social law , recommendations for the modification of dwel@@ lings , etc .
despite this , all of the above is not enough : the development of the disease can be fundamentally affected by the patient themselves .
the more actively they fight the disease , the longer they can work and not have to fundamentally change their lifestyle .
as highlighted by doctors , pas@@ sivity in patients leaves room for the activity of the disease .
for example , it has been proved that regular movement significantly dela@@ ys the time when the patient requires a compens@@ atory aid , for example a wal@@ k@@ ing-@@ stick .
it is important for patients and those around them to not believe various myths , for example that the disease will automatically lead to them being confined to a whe@@ el@@ chair .
this is one of the reasons behind the creation of the De@@ j S@@ i šanci -LRB- ` give yourself a chance ' , www.@@ bez@@ my@@ tu@@ .@@ c@@ z -RRB- web@@ site , which is supported by the ongoing De@@ j S@@ i šanci media campaign .
the most important person in the treatment of a patient with multiple scler@@ os@@ is is the neuro@@ logi@@ st .
the saying that the earlier you start to treat the illness , the more the doctor can influence something , doub@@ ly applies to multiple scler@@ os@@ is .
this is due to the fact that we have medicines that treat multiple scler@@ os@@ is in its infla@@ m@@ mat@@ ory stage , when the process of neuro@@ de@@ generation is not yet so strong .
the earlier we intervene , the greater the hope that we can stop the disease and postpone invali@@ disa@@ tion , explains M@@ U@@ D@@ r . Ev@@ a Med@@ ová from the neuro@@ logical clin@@ ic of the General faculty Ho@@ sp@@ ital in Prague .
P@@ hy@@ si@@ other@@ ap@@ y , which most often deals with the weakening of the lower lim@@ bs and balance disorders , is also highly important for those with multiple scler@@ os@@ is .
patients are treated according to their individual needs : to maintain condition , improve walking , strengthen the pel@@ vic floor , alleviate sw@@ allowing disorders or improve coordination .
`` It really is individual and depends on the specific difficulties being suffered by the patient , '@@ ' says M@@ U@@ D@@ r . Mar@@ tina K@@ ö@@ vá@@ ri , senior consul@@ tant at the P@@ hy@@ si@@ other@@ ap@@ y and physical Medic@@ ine clin@@ ic of the faculty Ho@@ sp@@ ital in Mot@@ ol .
while people with multiple scler@@ os@@ is suffer from the same illness , it manif@@ ests itself differently in everyone .
while physi@@ other@@ ap@@ y does not stop the illness , it always helps to alleviate its symptoms .
movement also strengthens the immune system , which is desirable in the case of multiple scler@@ os@@ is .
a further positive aspect of regular exercise is the fact that patients can check what all they can do , strengthening their self-confidence .
`` exercise also rele@@ ases endor@@ ph@@ ins , which help you feel good , '@@ ' notes Ph@@ D@@ r . Kam@@ ila Ř@@ as@@ ová from the P@@ hy@@ si@@ other@@ ap@@ y clin@@ ic of the Kr@@ ál@@ ovské V@@ in@@ oh@@ rady faculty Ho@@ sp@@ ital .
influencing the physical aspect has an effect on the lim@@ b@@ ic system , which is responsible for emotions .
it also has a direct effect on the patient '@@ s mental state and immune processes , stabili@@ sing the disease , she adds .
`` previously , these patients would save their energy , but today we know that they need targeted exercise , '@@ ' says Prof@@ . Pa@@ ed@@ D@@ r . Pavel Kol@@ ář , head of the P@@ hy@@ si@@ other@@ ap@@ y and physical Medic@@ ine clin@@ ic of the faculty Ho@@ sp@@ ital in Mot@@ ol .
the goal of physi@@ other@@ ap@@ y is for the patient to stay self-@@ sufficient for as long as possible , including at work .
P@@ hy@@ si@@ other@@ ap@@ ists therefore cooperate with er@@ go@@ therap@@ ists to ensure that every patient receives ma@@ de-@@ to-@@ measure compens@@ atory a@@ ids .
many patients also need the care of a psych@@ ologist or psychiatri@@ st .
they are in a difficult life situation .
most people are shaken when a serious illness enters their life .
they experience shock , panic , fear .
they must respond to a considerable burden - the loss of their health .
when our sole aches in this way we should talk to someone and not take the whole burden on ourselves .
`` I work with them in a way that they eventually reach the conclusion that they can still live a full life , even with a handic@@ ap , and that multiple scler@@ os@@ is does n@@ '@@ t mean the end of their life , '@@ ' says psycho@@ therap@@ ist Ren@@ ata Mal@@ in@@ ová@@ -@@ Schu@@ ber@@ tová from the neuro@@ logical clin@@ ic of the General faculty Ho@@ sp@@ ital in Prague .
Air@@ bu@@ ses could n@@ '@@ t fly without Prague manufacturer L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere
avi@@ ation manufacturing is syn@@ onym@@ ous with precision and advanced technology .
new aer@@ op@@ lan@@ es are full of tit@@ ani@@ um and light or heavy com@@ posite materials that ca n@@ '@@ t be produced and process@@ ed by just anybody .
nevertheless , alongside the super@@ precise , compu@@ ter-@@ guided machine tools and auto@@ cla@@ ves for the creation of com@@ posi@@ tes , you can also encounter something as ordinary as a@@ pric@@ ot seeds .
inside the dru@@ m , reminiscent of a can@@ dy@@ f@@ loss pot , a mass of a@@ pric@@ ot seeds are used to wear down she@@ et-@@ metal parts fresh off the mil@@ ling machine .
`` We have n@@ '@@ t found any better solution , '@@ ' s@@ miles Ivan Dub@@ ský , CEO of avi@@ ation doors manufacturer L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere Czech Republic .
previously known as L@@ et@@ ov , the company produces complete door systems for the Airbus A@@ 3@@ 20 at its complex in the L@@ et@@ ň@@ any district of Prague .
it is the only company in the world to supply doors for the Brazilian Em@@ bra@@ er 170 model .
passen@@ gers walk through these doors , part of which is produced in Prague , to enter first and higher classes on the upper dec@@ ks of the Airbus A@@ 3@@ 80 , the largest passen@@ ger plane in the world .
doors full of com@@ posite materials are also are also assembled here for the new Boeing 7@@ 87 Dre@@ am@@ liner .
here , precision is the watch@@ word .
for example , the company has tor@@ que wren@@ ches adjusted twice per year .
should a record of an inspection be absent from the yellow label , the company would have some explaining to do from the Airbus or Boeing aud@@ itors , who pay the company regular visits to ensure that doors are being produced in accordance with the agreed rules .
however , advanced technology has not yet entirely replaced human sen@@ ses .
there are 1,500 ri@@ ve@@ ts on a single Airbus A@@ 3@@ 20 door .
these must be attached manu@@ ally but ri@@ ve@@ ters .
it takes them two days .
they can recogni@@ se , even from the sound of a falling ham@@ mer , whether a ri@@ vet has been correctly ham@@ mer@@ ed .
the tolerance limits within which they operate are minimal .
a ri@@ vet can rise above the aer@@ op@@ lan@@ e surface by 0-@@ 0.@@ 13 m@@ illi@@ me@@ tre@@ s .
that is about twice the th@@ ick@@ ness of a human hair .
inspections utili@@ se a well-@@ trained sense of touch .
when an inspec@@ tor runs their finger along a row of ri@@ ve@@ ts , they recogni@@ se when one is outside the tolerance limit .
they then get out a precise devi@@ ation gau@@ ge .
before 1989 L@@ et@@ ov produced the L@@ -@@ 39 military practice plane .
however , by 1991 it was n@@ '@@ t producing any .
the company had to quickly find new customers .
back then it started working with European avi@@ ation producer Airbus .
it won a ten@@ der for the supply of emergency doors for the A@@ 3@@ 21 model .
approaches to Boeing were not so successful .
`` At the time we were too small a firm that did n@@ '@@ t have enough money for investment or to be able to guarantee Boeing the long-term stability of supply , '@@ ' re@@ members Dub@@ ský .
the doors to the American producer would have stayed closed had L@@ et@@ ov not caught the attention p@@ f the French L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere group at the International Air Tran@@ sport Association conference in Prague in 1999 .
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus .
the next day we started negotiations with the French , says Dub@@ ský .
a year later , L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere bought the Czech company , and with a major company came new orders .
as as early as 2000 the company started produced door parts for the A@@ 3@@ 20 .
three years later , they also started producing doors for the upper dec@@ k of the A@@ 3@@ 80 .
in 2006 the company built a new production h@@ all for the processing of com@@ posi@@ tes for orders for the Boeing Dre@@ am@@ liner .
without L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere we would n@@ '@@ t have won those big orders ourselves .
maybe we '@@ d have been making parts or small components .
our partners want a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ - to thir@@ ty@@ -year guarantee for goods supplied , explains Dub@@ ský .
last year the Czech L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere achieved turnover of over 2.@@ 9 billion crow@@ ns and an after@@ -@@ tax profit of 14@@ 7 million crow@@ ns .
having an exclusive status among suppliers to avi@@ ation manufacturers comes at a price .
since 2000 , L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere has invested 1.5 billion crow@@ ns in the Prague company .
the company must have quality cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates , cer@@ tification for 12@@ 70 special production processes and quali@@ fication cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates for key employees .
without these , the company would not be able to manufac@@ ture aer@@ op@@ lan@@ e doors .
according to Dub@@ ský , gaining cer@@ tification that production processes meet clients ' requirements and maintain them through repeated inspections costs millions of crow@@ ns .
production processes change every year@@ ,
becoming every more precise and stringent .
we have to give employees additional training , up@@ grade equipment and have the entire process re-@@ cer@@ tified , adds Dub@@ ský .
the company is currently completing preparations for a me@@ tal@@ -@@ pla@@ ting process using z@@ inc and n@@ ick@@ el , rather than c@@ admi@@ um , which is harmful to human health .
although they received the as@@ sign@@ ment from the manufacturer , they then had to adapt their technology to the equipment and chemicals used in Prague .
the Boeing people come and veri@@ fy the concept of the entire production line .
then we produce their goods .
they also in@@ spect our laboratory .
they test one set of samples themselves in their own laboratory then compare the results with ours , says Dub@@ ský , describing the inspection process used by their clients .
the Prague company '@@ s reward for this are exclusive , long-term contracts .
the production of Em@@ bra@@ er planes today stands and falls with the Prague pl@@ ant@@ ,
which produces half of its total volume of doors .
replacing the Czech branch of L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere would be very complicated , if not impossible , for the Brazilian or European producer .
however , this does not mean that they can name their price for doors .
an integral part of the contract is the price cur@@ ve .
this states how much doors will cost per ten , fifty and one hundred pieces produced .
the piece price falls to a certain limit value .
we must fit into this price equation .
if not , we '@@ ll be losing money , says Dub@@ ský .
half of the h@@ all where the electr@@ ical bo@@ xes for the Airbus A@@ 400 M military plane are being completed is so far empty .
it is , however , a symbol of the future .
behind the partition they are building a new semi-@@ robo@@ tic production line for the ri@@ ve@@ ting and assembly of doors for the new A@@ 3@@ 20 Ne@@ o model .
this will lead to faster , more precise ri@@ ve@@ ting .
`` This is a growing trend in avi@@ ation ri@@ ve@@ ting , '@@ ' adds Dub@@ ský .
the future production has its sales secured .
Airbus has announced that airlines have so far ordered 3,@@ 2@@ 70 of the the A@@ 3@@ 20 model .
only a few me@@ tre@@ s away they are building a production line for the complete assembly of doors for the upper dec@@ k of the A@@ 3@@ 80 .
this was a strategic decision of our parent company .
the goal is to shor@@ ten the production time and lower costs .
the full assembly process could start within two years , says Dub@@ ský .
before this , however , the company must undergo quali@@ fic@@ atory tests for e.g. the assembly of some electr@@ ical and electronic equipment for doors intended for the largest Airbus .
the company is relying on the further development of production from com@@ posite materials .
apart from Boeing , it should also participate in the new Airbus A@@ 350 program@@ me , which will compete with the American Dre@@ am@@ liner .
`` It '@@ s a massive boost to the company when it can produce both metal and com@@ posite materials , '@@ ' says Dub@@ ský proud@@ ly .
however , L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere is reaching the limit of its production capacity in the Czech Republic .
there is no more space in the L@@ et@@ ov complex where it is based .
before it was taken over by its French parent company , it had 180 employees .
now it has 800 employees , and might have a hundred more within three years .
as long as Airbus and Boeing will compete over how many hundreds of new aer@@ op@@ lan@@ es are ordered by airlines every year , L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere wo n@@ '@@ t have to worry about work .
despite having orders for several years to come , L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere '@@ s parent company was facing bankruptcy .
the French group did n@@ '@@ t have enough money to cover its September loan payments .
in the end , L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere was able to come to an agreement with its main credit@@ or@@ s@@ ,
who ex@@ changed part of their loans for shares at the end of August .
creditors gained a share of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 percent in the company through a 5@@ 7.@@ 4 million EU@@ R increase in capital .
company debt was reduced by two thirds , equal to 180 million EU@@ R .
the second part of the financial remedy came at the beginning of Sep@@ tem@@ ber@@ ,
when the company distributed new shares to the value of 2@@ 2@@ 2.@@ 9 million EU@@ R among existing shareholders .
the company thus increased its base capital by a total 2@@ 80 million EU@@ R .
the entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing , who between them have a 85 percent market share .
it anti@@ cip@@ ates an average annual rise of four percent in orders up to 20@@ 17 .
its order book contains orders worth 2.@@ 6 billion EU@@ R , corresponding to four years ' worth of production .
the French media has said that L@@ ate@@ co@@ ere can finally breathe easy after being on a dri@@ p-@@ feed for years .
the Czech plant in L@@ et@@ ň@@ any is a major one for the group@@ ,
contributing 16 percent of its income .
it is the group '@@ s largest branch abroad by number of employees .
MPs support greater state share in coal fees
a change in fees for the mining of miner@@ als is to bring 4@@ 27 million crow@@ ns more into state coffers than was the case in 2013 .
according to the government , the measure will have a neutral effect on the income of municipalities as fees will be higher .
in the year before last , municipalities gained appro@@ x . 450 million crow@@ ns and the state treasury 150 million crow@@ ns .
municipalities gained around 200 million crow@@ ns and the state 66 million crow@@ ns from li@@ gn@@ ite mining .
the amend@@ ment also anti@@ cip@@ ates the increase in payments from extrac@@ tion areas with mining permits to one thousand crow@@ ns per hec@@ t@@ are per year .
the enti@@ re@@ ty of income generated from these payment shall remain with the municipalities .
Minister for Indu@@ stry Jan M@@ lá@@ dek -LRB- Č@@ SS@@ D -RRB- told MPs that , thanks to this , municipalities will receive 100 million crow@@ ns per year , as opposed to the previous figure of 14 million crow@@ ns .
the amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law , but stipu@@ lated by the government through decre@@ es .
payments will be calculated as the product of the quantity of miner@@ als min@@ ed and rates for individual types of mineral .
according to the government , the reason for the change is , among others , the option of reacting flexi@@ bly to the current economic situation .
however , M@@ P M@@ are@@ k Ben@@ da -LRB- O@@ DS -RRB- warned that the setting of fees by government decre@@ e may not be in accordance with the constitution .
Minister M@@ lá@@ dek responded saying that this would not be a tax , as in this case the government is making miner@@ als - which are state property - subject to a fee .
fees are received by the municipalities whose territory is affected by mining .
in the case of deep coal mining , three-quarters of the money is received by municipalities and one quarter by the state .
the same proportions shall apply to the extrac@@ tion of radioactive ro@@ cks .
part of the money collected by the state from fees shall be tied to a single purpose .
for example , 28 percent must be directed towards the remed@@ ying of damage following mining or the funding of the mine rescue service .
the proposal was today critici@@ sed by opposition MPs , who chiefly claimed that it would harm both municipalities and regional governments .
for example , Mich@@ al Ku@@ čer@@ a -LRB- top 0@@ 9 a Sta@@ rost@@ ové -RRB- warned that mining companies would no longer want to spon@@ sor municipalities as before , as they would have to pay higher fees directly into state coffers .
`` You ca n@@ '@@ t asset-@@ strip some of the poorest regions just so that the Finance Minister can improve his budget , '@@ ' said David K@@ ád@@ ner -LRB- Ú@@ sv@@ it -RRB- , whose constituency is in the Ú@@ stí nad La@@ bem Regi@@ on
Communist M@@ P H@@ ana Au@@ lic@@ ká also warned of increased unemployment in the Most area .
K@@ ád@@ ner and Au@@ lic@@ ká un@@ successfully proposed the rejection of the amend@@ ment , and Ku@@ čer@@ a wanted to return it to the government for revision .
the explan@@ atory report states that , according to extrac@@ tion companies , increases in fees would not be transmitted to coal prices as more than 90 percent of these are agreed on a long-term basis .
the chief consumers , power stations , would not , therefore , feel an increase in prices .
`` On the other hand , though , this fact increases the risk that extrac@@ tion organis@@ ations will compensate for increased payments with efforts to reduce their operating costs , which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees , '@@ ' admits the government .
however , it also stated that a fee increase would be bearable in terms of employment .
according to Milan Ur@@ ban -LRB- Č@@ SS@@ D -RRB- , who tab@@ led the amend@@ ment , a key issue is for MPs to know the conclusions reached regarding the up@@ dated energy concept and , chiefly , the government '@@ s decision on coal extrac@@ tion limits before passing the law .
he emphasi@@ sed that , were coal to be min@@ ed beyond the limits , it would have an impact on yields for both the state and municipalities .
urban does not agree with M@@ lá@@ dek on the fact that the decision on the breaking of the limit at the Českosloven@@ ské armády mine should only be taken after 2020 .
he said that limits at the Českosloven@@ ské armády mine should be broken due to social reasons , the national economy and the Czech energy sector .
decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
the world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day and T@@ hur@@ sday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
a survey of 80 economists pol@@ led by R@@ eu@@ ters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-@@ 0.@@ 25 percent range .
it '@@ s a historical event because it '@@ s been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero .
for the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates , '@@ ' said Ang@@ el U@@ bi@@ de , senior fellow at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation .
however the Fed can not ignore the less rosy global outlook .
it has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move .
the decision is due to be announced at 20@@ .@@ 00 CE@@ T on T@@ hur@@ sday .
Del@@ ta State University shoot@@ er left note of apolo@@ gy
after shooting and killing his gir@@ l@@ friend in Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i on M@@ ond@@ ay morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - S@@ han@@ non lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was `` sorry '@@ ' for the first murder and wished he `` could take it back , '@@ ' authorities revealed Tu@@ es@@ day .
police in G@@ au@@ tier , M@@ iss@@ . said lam@@ b , a geography and social science education instruc@@ tor at Del@@ ta State University , called 9@@ 11 around 10 a@@ .@@ m .
M@@ ond@@ ay and said he had shot and killed someone .
lam@@ b told the dispat@@ cher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
he said `` I shot my wife last night '@@ ' and also mentioned that there is a `` swe@@ et dog '@@ ' in the house that is `` not going to bother anyone '@@ ' but is likely upset .
police asked the cal@@ ler his name , but he did n@@ '@@ t give it .
lam@@ b did not provide an explanation for the shooting .
when police got to the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from lam@@ b , 45 , that said : `` I am so sorry I wish I could take it back .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only person who ever loved me .
after writing the note , lam@@ b drove 300 miles to Del@@ ta State where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a history professor , before eventually taking his own life late M@@ ond@@ ay as c@@ ops closed in .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did n@@ '@@ t know of any conflict between lam@@ b and Schmidt but `` obviously there was something in Mr. lam@@ b '@@ s mind . '@@ '
despite reports M@@ ond@@ ay that lam@@ b allegedly believed Pr@@ enti@@ ss was also roman@@ tically involved with Schmidt , authorities said Tu@@ es@@ day that there was `` no information , no evidence '@@ ' of a `` love tri@@ angle . '@@ '
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described as a `` good person '@@ ' by Sha@@ wn O@@ '@@ Ste@@ en , who said he had been married to her for about seven years .
the two divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O@@ '@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was `` devastated . '@@ '
he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss and her daughter were `` absolutely best friends . '@@ '
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked an online job from her home , according to L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , identified as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss by the Sun Her@@ al@@ d .
K@@ now@@ les said Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a h@@ ound dog named ligh@@ t@@ ning , had been dating lam@@ b for about three years .
`` S@@ he always wanted to help other people , '@@ ' K@@ now@@ les said .
police said lam@@ b had ph@@ oned relatives at some point M@@ ond@@ ay to tell them `` he '@@ s not going to jail . '@@ '
when c@@ ops caught up with him on H@@ igh@@ way 1 near Green@@ v@@ ille later that night , lam@@ b pulled his car over , bailed out on foot , ran into the wo@@ ods and shot and killed himself .
lam@@ b received a doc@@ torate in education from Del@@ ta State in the spring of 2015 , according to his resume post@@ ed on the university '@@ s web@@ site .

Manchest@@ er United '@@ s Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w out for months with double fra@@ cture
Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg during Manchest@@ er United '@@ s Ch@@ ampi@@ ons League defeat at P@@ S@@ V E@@ ind@@ hov@@ en .
while this left the full-@@ back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al remains hopeful Sha@@ w could play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reckless tackle from H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15@@ th minute after the 20-@@ year-old Sha@@ w had burst into the P@@ S@@ V area .
he had nine minutes of treatment on the pit@@ ch and required oxy@@ gen before being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : `` He has a double leg fra@@ cture and is in hospital . '@@ '
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchest@@ er .
it is awful - a boy who comes to Manchest@@ er United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fanta@@ st@@ ically and then this happens .
when it was in the dressing room he had an oxy@@ gen mask on .
he was c@@ rying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double fra@@ cture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Mor@@ eno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spo@@ t-@@ kick .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ ol@@ i , the refer@@ ee , did not pen@@ ali@@ se the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suggested the Italian official had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
it was a very bad tackle with two leg@@ s .
a t@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ w '@@ s account read : `` T@@ han@@ k you everyone for your messages , words ca n@@ '@@ t describe how g@@ ut@@ ted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . '@@ '
related : Manchest@@ er United suffer Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w blow in defeat at P@@ S@@ V
the England defen@@ der will have an added incentive to recover with the European Ch@@ ampi@@ on@@ ship in France next June .
Ph@@ illi@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the P@@ S@@ V co@@ ach , said : `` It '@@ s a very bad injury . '@@ '
if any player goes off with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to in@@ j@@ ure an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against V@@ an Ga@@ al '@@ s Holland at the 2014 World Cup .
`` He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to in@@ j@@ ure the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it '@@ s not good , '@@ ' C@@ oc@@ u said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he -LSB- Mor@@ eno -RSB- touched it , but I could n@@ '@@ t see the tackle on Lu@@ ke .
speaking to S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : `` I know how it feels , I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it , I am so sorry .
P@@ S@@ V '@@ s Andrés Gu@@ ard@@ ad@@ o was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Ch@@ ris S@@ mal@@ ling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ a@@ x better than this ?
it '@@ s one thing any parent soon lear@@ ns : when your child lov@@ es a book , it wo n@@ '@@ t be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seems , you are David Cameron .
asked by a provider of holiday child@@ care schemes to name his fav@@ ou@@ rit@@ e kids ' book , the prime minister opted for The Lor@@ a@@ x , the 1971 environmental f@@ able by D@@ r Se@@ us@@ s .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message published on the web@@ site of the Sup@@ er@@ C@@ amp@@ s company , continuing : `` fun@@ ny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it '@@ s one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed . '@@ '
all very well , except that the subsequent parag@@ rap@@ h in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a pré@@ c@@ is of the 2012 film version , which added new charac@@ ters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text .
`` set in the wal@@ led city of Th@@ ne@@ ed-@@ V@@ ille , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , A@@ ud@@ rey , by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , '@@ ' it read@@ s , chron@@ ic@@ ling a love interest unknown to D@@ r Se@@ us@@ s , real name The@@ od@@ or Se@@ us@@ s G@@ ei@@ sel , who died in 1991 .
if that was n@@ '@@ t suspicious enough , Cameron '@@ s submitted text read@@ s in part like a plot summary of the Lor@@ a@@ x film provided on the Internet movie datab@@ ase web@@ site , which begins : `` In the wal@@ led city of Th@@ ne@@ ed-@@ V@@ ille , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , A@@ ud@@ rey . '@@ '
given he is an avo@@ w@@ edly hand@@ s-@@ on parent , it seems unlikely Cameron is so un@@ familiar with the book '@@ s plot , in which a young un@@ named boy he@@ ars how the local environment was devastated by the av@@ ar@@ icious , tre@@ e-@@ chop@@ ping , th@@ ne@@ ed-@@ k@@ nit@@ ting O@@ n@@ ce-@@ ler , despite the protests of the e@@ pon@@ y@@ m@@ ous Lor@@ a@@ x , a squ@@ at , mou@@ sta@@ chi@@ o@@ ed cre@@ ature who `` speaks for the trees . '@@ '
most likely , such a relatively low@@ ly PR task would have been outsour@@ ced to an ai@@ de , seemingly one who has never read The Lor@@ a@@ x 20 times in a row to a child .
a D@@ owning Street spokes@@ woman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron '@@ s constituency office .
Sup@@ er@@ C@@ amp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron '@@ s staff , but had no further immediate comment .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly at risk of England om@@ is@@ sion but it '@@ s still tough
taking on Pakistan in the United Arab E@@ mi@@ rates is a tough as@@ sign@@ ment but after seeing the squ@@ ad England have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3-@@ 0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I would n@@ '@@ t rule out an away win , either .
A@@ la@@ sta@@ ir Co@@ ok '@@ s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that bat@@ ting line@@ up and the collective mindset is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful posi@@ tivity .
with the ball , Mo@@ e@@ en Ali is developing as a sp@@ inner and Ad@@ il Ra@@ shi@@ d , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , represents an attacking option .
related : Adam Ly@@ th dropped from England Test squ@@ ad and replaced by A@@ lex H@@ ales
the decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is obviously a tough one for me to analy@@ se as his head co@@ ach at Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
his seven tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that crick@@ e@@ ters are judged on output .
there were no question marks over Joe root , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selec@@ tors .
a couple of half-@@ centuries and Ly@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny .
hop@@ efully if he pun@@ ches out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire another opportunity will come along .
the England head co@@ ach , Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss , praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
the question of how long a Test bat@@ sman gets to make his mark is a tough one .
Ly@@ th got seven caps - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while N@@ ick Com@@ p@@ ton got nine .
only Com@@ p@@ ton got the chance home and away .
the only gri@@ pe you could have was that England went for J@@ ona@@ than T@@ rot@@ t in the Caribbean first - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now .
A@@ lex H@@ ales comes in and he is a bat@@ sman I rate highly .
he is an X-@@ factor crick@@ e@@ ter , which we at Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire saw early this season when he made 2@@ 36 against us on a T@@ rent B@@ rid@@ ge pit@@ ch that was doing a bit .
he must at least be affor@@ ded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the mak@@ e-up of the side in the U@@ AE .
the idea of Mo@@ e@@ en opening the bat@@ ting alongside Co@@ ok , which would get the extra sp@@ inner in while keeping four quick@@ s , has been floated and it is not something I am against .
I do n@@ '@@ t see why a stro@@ k@@ em@@ aker can not b@@ at there and this left-@@ hand@@ er has already shown he is one hell of a crick@@ e@@ ter .
Mo@@ e@@ en may not have done the job for his coun@@ ty , Wor@@ cest@@ er@@ sh@@ ire , but he has been a No@@ 3 for them and there is not much difference .
my old te@@ am@@ -@@ mate Just@@ in L@@ anger played his first 38 tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001 .
he pe@@ eled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes into the squ@@ ad as back@@ -up sp@@ inner and , in my limited dealings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
people may look at his raw stat@@ s - averaging 31 with the b@@ at and 35 with the ball - and think it '@@ s a pun@@ t but there are not a he@@ ap of sp@@ in@@ ners putting their hands up and selec@@ tors have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squ@@ ad , England look to have made a couple of shrew@@ d addi@@ tions to their co@@ aching staff .
the appointment of Ma@@ hel@@ a J@@ ay@@ awar@@ den@@ e , the Sri Lanka bat@@ sman , as a consul@@ tant for the Test matches could be a master@@ stroke .
he is one of the game '@@ s lov@@ eli@@ est blo@@ kes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes in for the wh@@ ite@@ -@@ ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless stre@@ ak into the set@@ up .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket , be it playing or co@@ aching , and like Ma@@ hel@@ a has n@@ ous that can be tap@@ ped .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can fre@@ sh@@ en up a side .
Col@@ ly '@@ s D@@ ur@@ ham te@@ am@@ -@@ mate Ben sto@@ kes is rested for the one-@@ da@@ yers , root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
while not everyone will agree , the co@@ aches and selec@@ tors do not set the schedule .
and you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
such decisions are never taken lightly .
Bre@@ x@@ it camp might win the day if economy is in dol@@ dru@@ ms by 20@@ 17
David Cameron '@@ s half-@@ bak@@ ed renegoti@@ ation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes , even without the election of gen@@ ial Jer@@ em@@ y `` Is it Yes or No ? '@@ ' Cor@@ by@@ n to the Labour leadership , or the T@@ U@@ C cutting up rough over Europe on Tu@@ es@@ day .
foreigners have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages too .
a European diplomat ch@@ um explained the other day that , sun@@ k in as@@ sor@@ ted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain '@@ s self-@@ absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes which they mostly do n@@ '@@ t want .
in B@@ righ@@ ton for its annual bean , the T@@ U@@ C decided it did n@@ '@@ t want them either if they eroded social protection .
we could even call it Da@@ ve and George '@@ s sel@@ fie agenda .
P@@ M and chan@@ cellor rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monu@@ ment , with or without local gran@@ de@@ e , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
it '@@ s all about me .
my European pal , who wants an outw@@ ar@@ d-looking Britain inside the EU tent - `` Do n@@ '@@ t leave us alone with France , '@@ ' says Berlin - suggests that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they do n@@ '@@ t care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , Germany '@@ s cau@@ tiously le@@ vel@@ -@@ headed chan@@ cellor , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for over@@ sta@@ yers Thatcher -LRB- 11 years -RRB- , Mitterrand -LRB- 14 -RRB- and Kohl -LRB- 16 -RRB- .
France '@@ s François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 20@@ 17 .
he is a fading force too .
Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
it '@@ s hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Sel@@ fie Br@@ its , whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they do n@@ '@@ t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies .
so some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately un@@ helpful remarks , S@@ NP@@ -style , during the UK '@@ s 20@@ 17 referendum campaign to ha@@ sten the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my pal suggests .
`` The renegoti@@ ation was a fix '@@ ' and `` Britain got nothing of value out of the renegoti@@ ation . '@@ '
the Europeans know to their cost how predatory Fle@@ et Street can be and how EU-@@ scep@@ tic the oligarch press bar@@ ons are , as they were not during the Tony Ben@@ n-@@ inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may di@@ m@@ ly remember Boris Johnson , the arch Euro-@@ opportuni@@ st , making his name as an `` EU straight ban@@ an@@ as '@@ ' Brussels correspond@@ ent in the early 9@@ 0s .
for all his fooli@@ shness E@@ d Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
they included the med@@ ley of tax-@@ shy ra@@ sc@@ als , ph@@ one-@@ hac@@ king foreigners and pseu@@ do non-@@ doms who own most of our great newspapers .
actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them , but real@@ ised that when you '@@ re in a cage with a ran@@ dy gor@@ illa you have to pass the ban@@ an@@ as to distra@@ ct it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir@@ ite than Blair in opposing Cameron '@@ s referendum whe@@ eze , since Blair had con@@ ceded the principle over the EU '@@ s abor@@ ted constitution , sun@@ k by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get@@ -out card .
the press never for@@ gave him that either .
but nice Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly pat on the back at West@@ min@@ ster on M@@ ond@@ ay - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-@@ adopting Ne@@ il K@@ inno@@ ck '@@ s boycott Murdo@@ ch strategy of the 8@@ 0s , a mistake then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sof@@ a he vac@@ ated on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n '@@ s official position on Europe is what I will kin@@ dly call evolving .
he says he '@@ d like us to stay in a reformed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ K@@ I@@ P '@@ s wo@@ ad@@ -@@ wearing tendency and the wil@@ der sho@@ res of T@@ ory little Eng@@ lan@@ der@@ ism can probably say yes to that .
it '@@ s what Hil@@ ary `` A Ben@@ n , but not a Ben@@ n@@ ite '@@ ' Ben@@ n said on radio and TV this week as the boy S@@ cou@@ t in him struggled not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n '@@ s appointment of ab@@ ra@@ sive John Mc@@ Don@@ ne@@ ll as shadow chan@@ cellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 7@@ 0s , when his old dad struggled on TV to be dis@@ loyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary '@@ s struggle was more attractive .
but fighting to stay in `` in all circumstances '@@ ' - Ben@@ n '@@ s phrase - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ ne@@ ll was saying , nor what J@@ C told peers and MPs at their private meeting on M@@ ond@@ ay night , by all accounts .
whatever the bottom@@ -up , tou@@ chy@@ -@@ fe@@ ely image Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember , he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 2@@ 4@@ /@@ 7 TV and especially in the ma@@ el@@ st@@ rom that is social media , a hot@@ bed of parano@@ ia and betrayal .
it '@@ s fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour '@@ s support for granted in the referendum campaign , as Mc@@ Don@@ ne@@ ll has said .
Sim@@ on J@@ en@@ k@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ ne@@ ll and Cor@@ by@@ n '@@ s basic equi@@ vo@@ cation about EU membership - consistent with their Ben@@ n@@ ite siege economy , anti-@@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic discussion among lef@@ tw@@ ing dissidents for whom the nar@@ ci@@ ssi@@ sm of small difference is a central ten@@ et of doctr@@ inal squab@@ bles .
as with his equi@@ vo@@ cation over Nato - T@@ om Watson is adam@@ ant that J@@ C wo n@@ '@@ t campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless ?
the US is already pretty disappointed with the Br@@ its '@@ ' fee@@ ble military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost-@@ cutting T@@ ory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on M@@ ond@@ ay .
experts critici@@ se Public Health England e-@@ ciga@@ ret@@ tes review
claims by a government-@@ funded agency that e-@@ ciga@@ ret@@ tes are 95 % less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
experts writing in the British Medical Journal -LRB- B@@ M@@ J -RRB- joined the Lancet in critici@@ sing the evidence used by Public Health England -LRB- P@@ H@@ E -RRB- in its report on e-@@ ciga@@ ret@@ tes .
P@@ H@@ E published the `` landmark '@@ ' report last month , describing it as a `` comprehensive review of the evidence . '@@ '
but several researchers have questioned the robust@@ ness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the `` extraordinarily f@@ lim@@ sy foundation '@@ ' on which P@@ H@@ E based its main conclusion .
writing in the B@@ M@@ J , two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were `` built on rock or sand . '@@ '
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European public health at the London School of Hy@@ gi@@ ene and T@@ rop@@ ical Medic@@ ine , and Sim@@ on Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of clinical epidemi@@ ology at the University of Li@@ ver@@ pool , said : `` A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . '@@ '
they said the public would expect P@@ H@@ E '@@ s claims that `` the current best estimate is that e-@@ ciga@@ ret@@ tes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking '@@ ' would be based on a detailed review of evidence and mode@@ l@@ ling .
in fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-@@ criteria decision analysis -LRB- M@@ CD@@ A -RRB- model to syn@@ the@@ si@@ se their opinions on the harms associated with different nic@@ ot@@ ine-@@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research paper .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said one spon@@ sor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco for an independent study .
he also endorsed b@@ at '@@ s public health credentials in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-@@ ciga@@ ret@@ te manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Phili@@ p Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e-@@ ciga@@ ret@@ te champions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at P@@ H@@ E .
the research paper produced by the group `` tel@@ l@@ ingly conce@@ des '@@ ' there is a lack of `` hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria , '@@ ' Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the P@@ H@@ E report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said P@@ H@@ E '@@ s claims that `` there is no evidence so far that e-@@ ciga@@ ret@@ tes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-@@ smo@@ kers '@@ ' were premature .
Pro@@ f K@@ ev@@ in F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and wel@@ l@@ being at P@@ H@@ E , said the claims in the B@@ M@@ J had been responded to before .
he said : `` E@@ -@@ ciga@@ ret@@ tes are significantly less harmful than smoking . '@@ '
one in two lifel@@ ong smo@@ kers dies from their addiction .
all of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-@@ ciga@@ ret@@ tes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long-term effects .
P@@ H@@ E has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smo@@ k@@ ing-@@ related illness and smoking costs the N@@ H@@ S £ 2@@ bn a year .
by sp@@ elling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-@@ ciga@@ ret@@ tes are not risk-@@ free , they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national rem@@ it .
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former Chan@@ nel 4 chief
the former Chan@@ nel 4 chairman Lu@@ ke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broad@@ casting program@@ mes such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Vo@@ ice , saying its commercial rivals would `` give their right arm '@@ ' for hit shows such as the Albert Square so@@ ap .
Johnson said the L@@ ic@@ ence fee should only be used to make the sort of program@@ mes that are not made by other UK broad@@ ca@@ sters .
he critici@@ sed the BBC for putting public service program@@ mes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough sl@@ ots against its rivals '@@ ' biggest rating shows , and on channels such as B@@ B@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC '@@ s director general , Tony H@@ all , said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organis@@ ations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Chan@@ nel 4 to do a ti@@ e-up with the BBC without success .
`` I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broad@@ casts program@@ mes that would clearly be shown by un@@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed rivals , '@@ ' Johnson told the House of Lor@@ ds communication committee , as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC .
if you keep the L@@ ic@@ ence fee , which I '@@ m not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to program@@ mes that others are n@@ '@@ t making and commis@@ sion@@ ing .
they broadcast The Vo@@ ice in a prime slo@@ t because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
the idea that no one else would show that is a joke , it '@@ s lu@@ dic@@ rous , it '@@ s obviously nonsense .
Johnson said : `` I do n@@ '@@ t see why a re@@ gressive tax should fund program@@ mes that could be funded without subsidy .
the Vo@@ ice is one , East@@ En@@ ders is another , admittedly made in-@@ house .
frankly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I struggle to see how it '@@ s public service broad@@ casting .
I do n@@ '@@ t think that would diminish the BBC at all .
Johnson , a seri@@ al entreprene@@ ur who led Chan@@ nel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was guilty of ch@@ asing ratings `` because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support . '@@ '
his comments about the BBC '@@ s most popular shows echo those of former S@@ ky executive Tony ball , who used his Mac@@ T@@ ag@@ g@@ art lecture in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said the BBC '@@ s more ni@@ che public service program@@ mes `` go on to B@@ B@@ C@@ 4 where quite often you ca n@@ '@@ t measure the audience but they fulf@@ il their rem@@ it and they can argue when they go on their san@@ cti@@ mon@@ ious missions about justifying £ 4@@ bn in L@@ ic@@ ence fee income , `` Well of course , we do all these obscure program@@ mes that no one watched . '@@ '
they put them on a slo@@ t where no one was ever going to watch them .
on the L@@ ic@@ ence fee , Johnson told the committee : `` I challenge you to find a more re@@ gressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
of course you all think , we all think , £ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they do n@@ '@@ t consume a lot of the BBC .
former S@@ ky and Chan@@ nel 5 executive David El@@ stein , who also gave evidence to the committee on Tu@@ es@@ day , said the BBC should revise its R@@ eith@@ ian mission to `` inform , educate and enter@@ tain . '@@ '
he said little of the BBC '@@ s output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV output and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broad@@ ca@@ sters in Australia and Canada and change it to `` inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . '@@ '
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said only a handful were shown on TV , and enter into alliances with commercial broad@@ ca@@ sters to make them all available to watch online .
` S@@ on@@ ogene@@ tics ' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
the video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change direction the moment they are bla@@ sted with s@@ onic pul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change direction the moment they are bla@@ sted with s@@ onic pul@@ ses that are too high-@@ pit@@ ched for humans to hear .
the pul@@ ses work by swit@@ ching on motor neur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry memb@@ ran@@ e channels that respond to ultra@@ s@@ onic waves .
related : researchers read and write brain activity with light
researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure , dubbed son@@ ogene@@ tics , in which ultra@@ sound can be used to activ@@ ate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells from outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Ch@@ al@@ as@@ ani , a research@@ er at the Sal@@ k Institute in L@@ a J@@ ol@@ la , California , told the Gu@@ ar@@ dian that the procedure could one day replace deep-@@ brain stimu@@ lation , an inva@@ sive procedure that delivers electr@@ ical pul@@ ses into people '@@ s brains to treat symptoms of Par@@ kin@@ son '@@ s disease .
Nem@@ at@@ ode worms do not usually react to ultra@@ sound , but Ch@@ al@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing micro@@ sc@@ opic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found , ampli@@ fy the ultra@@ s@@ onic waves which then pass inside the worms .
the amp@@ lified ultra@@ sound waves act on structures called TR@@ P@@ -@@ 4 ion channels , found in the memb@@ ran@@ es of some of the worms '@@ ' cells .
the sound waves make these ion channels open up and activ@@ ate the cells they are attached to , according to a report in Nature Commun@@ ic@@ ations .
to make ultra@@ soun@@ d-@@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des , Ch@@ al@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neur@@ ons carried TR@@ P@@ -@@ 4 ion channels .
when he applied ultra@@ sound to the modified creatures , the sound waves were amp@@ lified by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted into the worms , where they swit@@ ched on the modified motor neur@@ ons .
the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons on and off with pul@@ ses of light .
but Ch@@ al@@ as@@ ani said that son@@ ogene@@ tics could have some advantages over that technique .
unlike light , which has to be sent down an op@@ tic fi@@ br@@ e to the desired location inside the brain , low frequency ultra@@ sound waves can pass through tissue un@@ hind@@ ered , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the sk@@ ul@@ l .
`` We believe that , using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it may be possible to make target human neur@@ ons temporarily susceptible to the ultra@@ sound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , '@@ ' said Ch@@ al@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insu@@ lin@@ -@@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student hal@@ ls
it '@@ s been 11 years since I moved into student hal@@ ls as an oblivi@@ ous 19@@ -year-old , still believing in ber@@ ets and moral relativ@@ ism , but it '@@ s only now I recall the strained s@@ miles of those I an@@ no@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be dist@@ il@@ led into eight simple rules .
moving into hal@@ ls can range from mil@@ dly ner@@ ve-@@ ra@@ cking to totally terrifying .
it '@@ s tempting to bab@@ ble : telling people where you '@@ re from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on Cor@@ by@@ n and why you `` honestly neither love nor hate M@@ arm@@ ite because seriously gu@@ ys it '@@ s just ye@@ ast extract H@@ A@@ H@@ A@@ H@@ A I '@@ ll be in my room .

and help others take one too - ask questions and show interest .
it ste@@ ers the conversation and helps you to S@@ cou@@ t out the people you like versus those you would n@@ '@@ t talk to even if your eye@@ la@@ shes were on fire and they were dispen@@ sing extin@@ gui@@ sh@@ ers .
give people space .
people '@@ s rooms often mor@@ ph into drin@@ ks recep@@ tions , mov@@ i@@ e-@@ night ven@@ ues and communal hang@@ out spots , but they '@@ re also where people get dressed and adjust their under@@ wear .

In@@ t@@ rover@@ ts get a raw deal at university .
your room should be a retreat , yet many hal@@ ls form an inter-@@ ro@@ om@@ -@@ stro@@ l@@ ling culture that '@@ s friendly , social and conducive to lifel@@ ong friend@@ ships .
that can be hell for someone who '@@ s trying to re@@ charge .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , `` I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I '@@ ve expen@@ ded on inter@@ acting with you . '@@ '
try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ alis@@ ing - and maybe text instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
one gu@@ y in my student hal@@ ls had a policy that if a door was n@@ '@@ t locked he was invited in .
he saw some things .
make friends through bak@@ ing .
since you '@@ re starting uni at the height of Bak@@ e-@@ O@@ ff man@@ ia , kno@@ cking on people '@@ s doors to introduce yourself with a pla@@ te of bro@@ w@@ nies seems margin@@ ally less we@@ ir@@ d , less 1950s `` welcome to the neighb@@ our@@ hood , I bak@@ ed you something , now smile as I ask you personal questions .

offering hom@@ em@@ ade treats is a great way to make friends .
your hous@@ em@@ ates will feel obliged to chat , and may end up associ@@ ating your face with a ta@@ sty surprise .

she '@@ s in jail now .
you should n@@ '@@ t make no@@ ise that keeps people from sle@@ eping or studying .
this is n@@ '@@ t just to be a decent human , but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses .
a girl on my corrid@@ or asked her neighb@@ our if they would n@@ '@@ t mind turning down the dru@@ m and bas@@ s because it was 3@@ am and she had an ex@@ am in the morning .
they responded by turning it up .
when they finally shut up at 5@@ am , she kin@@ dly let them sleep for two hours before bla@@ sting her own music , locking her door as she left for her three-@@ hour ex@@ am .
would n@@ '@@ t it be romantic if your future spo@@ use happened to move into the same h@@ all as you ?
Conversely , would n@@ '@@ t it be k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le-@@ bit@@ ingly awkward if you mist@@ o@@ ok a hall@@ mate for your future spo@@ use , ho@@ oked up , broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get cust@@ ody of all your mutual friends ?
of course , the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hall@@ mate is definitely not your future spo@@ use , try to at least talk some sense into your gro@@ in .

Ev@@ a looked forward to having twins , despite uncertain prospects for the future .
Ev@@ a experienced hardship even while she was pregnant with Ví@@ tek , who is now seven years old .
Ví@@ tek '@@ s father had left her , leaving her to prepare for the baby on her own .
I came to terms with the situation relatively quickly - I was really looking forward to the baby and looked for the posi@@ tives .
I tried not to bother myself with uncertainty and the fact that I '@@ d be bringing the baby up on my own .
and I definitely had the hope that we would n@@ '@@ t be on our own for long , says Ev@@ a , remembering her first pregnancy .
even back then , on the Internet she met V@@ aš@@ ek , who was older than her and who she started to talk about her fav@@ ou@@ rit@@ e films with .
V@@ aš@@ ek even took Ev@@ a and Ví@@ tek home from the mater@@ nity hospital , but was n@@ '@@ t in too much of a rush to assume the role of ste@@ p@@ father .
`` He then took a back seat for a while , '@@ ' says Ev@@ a in document@@ ary series Č@@ ty@@ ři V T@@ om 3 .
the theme of the third season of the Czech television series having another go at finding happiness .
Ev@@ a cop@@ ed with caring for Ví@@ tek and supporting the family through part-time work and a lot of help from her mother and a@@ unt .
in the end , even the prospect of responsibility for someone else '@@ s child did n@@ '@@ t spo@@ il V@@ aš@@ ek '@@ s affec@@ tion for Ev@@ a .
they finally became a couple around Ví@@ tek '@@ s second birthday , and Ví@@ tek now sees V@@ aš@@ ek as his father , and calls him this , too .
even though V@@ aš@@ ek already has two adult daughters , he himself says that he is enjoying fa@@ therhood at sixty , and can also devote more time to children .
since then , Ví@@ tek has been joined by two-year old Leon@@ tý@@ na , and even twins .
`` V@@ aš@@ ek has f@@ itted right in with our family , maybe because my mother has never inter@@ fer@@ ed in my relationships much , '@@ ' s@@ miles Ev@@ a .
not much space ?
at least we '@@ re close to one another .
twins E@@ ma and E@@ la were born by Ca@@ es@@ are@@ an section after Ev@@ a was diagnosed with cho@@ le@@ st@@ as@@ is in the closing stages of her pregnancy .
C@@ ho@@ le@@ st@@ as@@ is is a disorder in the production and activity of b@@ ile aci@@ ds , which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of the pregnant woman and manif@@ ests itself in it@@ ch@@ iness .
the illness is dangerous to the un@@ born fo@@ e@@ tus , which is at risk of premature birth and death . it usually disappears of its own accord in the mother following birth .
lu@@ ck@@ ily for Ev@@ a and V@@ aš@@ ek , E@@ ma and E@@ la were born healthy , even though she was only in her 3@@ 6@@ th week .
little E@@ ma was placed in an inc@@ ub@@ ator on an intermedi@@ ary ward where V@@ aš@@ ek '@@ s ni@@ ece worked , who was able to take care of her and see that she was accommod@@ ated .
E@@ la was bigger and I had her by my side as soon as I was taken from intensive care to my room , says Ev@@ a about the difficult time after the birth .
she spent twenty days in the mater@@ nity hospital until the doctors dis@@ charged the babies , who had reached the weight of two kil@@ os .
Ev@@ a did n@@ '@@ t enjoy the wait in hospital .
`` I was going crazy being away from my husband and children , '@@ ' says the mother of four , remembering the difficult moments on the post@@ par@@ tum ward .
she and her husband had considered fil@@ ing a compla@@ int due to the in@@ sensitive manner of one doctor .
in the end that did n@@ '@@ t happen and the doctors dis@@ charged Ev@@ a and the twins .

Ev@@ a is convinced that the children see the comfort of family life and the pleasant atmosphere , and not the size or sh@@ ab@@ bin@@ ess of the house .
for now we '@@ re coping quite well , better than we '@@ d expected .
while it '@@ s harder to hide un@@ ti@@ d@@ iness in such a small space and we sometimes step over the rolling babies , at least we '@@ re all close to one another , laugh@@ s Ev@@ a , who can see the positive side of any situation .

Apple hit by the y@@ o-@@ yo effect .
it '@@ s all because of the displa@@ ys .
a more powerful process@@ or , higher-@@ resolution camer@@ a , stronger c@@ asing and display screen that can discern different touch strengths are the advantages offered by the recently launched nin@@ th-@@ generation i@@ P@@ hon@@ es .
the last two listed have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of 6@@ s and 6@@ s P@@ lus i@@ P@@ hon@@ es .
up until now the trend with Apple has been for every generation of i@@ P@@ hone to be ligh@@ ter than the one before it .
the only exceptions to this were the third and fourth generations , whose weight was slightly more than that of preceding i@@ P@@ hon@@ es .
however , the two-@@ gra@@ m@@ me difference from previous models was truly negligible .
this is far from true for new i@@ P@@ hon@@ es .
compared to last year '@@ s 6 and 6 P@@ lus i@@ P@@ hon@@ es , the weight of the smaller model rose by 14 gra@@ m@@ mes and the larger by a whole 20 gra@@ m@@ mes .
on the one hand it '@@ s no wonder - last year '@@ s affair with phones b@@ ending in pockets caused Apple some considerable problems .
the new models ' c@@ asing is made of tougher 7@@ 000 alu@@ mini@@ um allo@@ y , which also manifested itself in the weight .
however , the displa@@ ys have a much greater impact .
in these new models Apple has used 3@@ D touch technology , which helps displa@@ ys distinguish between the strength of touch .
this meant that displa@@ ys had to be f@@ itted with an extra layer of capacity sen@@ sors .
the weight of the screens of new i@@ P@@ hon@@ es thus more than doubled against preceding generations .
in the smaller i@@ P@@ hone it rose from 12 to 29 gra@@ m@@ mes , and in the larger one from 19 to 40 gra@@ m@@ mes .
in the i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s the display is the he@@ avi@@ est component used .
the full weight of this new model , a mere 14@@ 3 gra@@ m@@ mes , is then reached through the sti@@ ff@@ ening c@@ asing , which affected all other components .
in the larger model , the largest component used is the battery , whose weight has not , however , increased against its predecessor .
here , too , the greatest growth has been in the display .
the weight of the 5.@@ 5 '@@ ' i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s is thus 192 gra@@ m@@ mes .
the practic@@ ality of the new display technology will become apparent only through use .
users will be able to try it our for the first time on Fri@@ day 25 September , when sale of the i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s and 6@@ s P@@ lus will begin in selected countries .
have fl@@ akes been the break@@ fast of champions for tens of thousands of years ?
archa@@ e@@ ologists in Gro@@ t@@ ta P@@ ag@@ lic@@ ci , Italy have made a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities .
they have discovered tra@@ ces of settlements of modern humans from various periods , including wal@@ l-@@ pa@@ int@@ ings , remains of tools and so on .
however , at level 2@@ 3@@ A , which according to the tools found dates back 30 thousand years , researchers have found something that is strongly reminiscent of the remains of a break@@ fast buff@@ et .
at the site they found tra@@ ces of o@@ at gra@@ ins that apparently went through a production process similar to the o@@ at fl@@ akes that are so popular today .
in this process , gra@@ ins are first so@@ aked , then dri@@ ed , sh@@ elled , blan@@ ched and flat@@ tened .
gra@@ ins have been found in P@@ ag@@ lic@@ ci ca@@ ve that were evidently heated up or blan@@ ched , then ground between two mil@@ l@@ stones - this is at least indicated by tra@@ ces of use found on two stones in the ca@@ ve .
while researchers were not able to prove in their article for P@@ NA@@ S magazine that the complete fl@@ ake production process took place in the ca@@ ve , the resemb@@ lance is quite striking .
we also do not have any evidence of how the people ate the fl@@ akes , although the possibility that it would have been with some liquid and quite possibly also served warm , is entirely logical .
at the same time it is highly interesting evidence of how inten@@ sively people used cer@@ e@@ als , even long before the rise of agriculture .
thus if the o@@ at fl@@ ake interpretation is correct , the oldest fl@@ akes preceded agriculture by approximately twenty thousand years .
new stop announcement with the Br@@ no Public Tran@@ sport Com@@ ap@@ ny
so once again I listened to the announc@@ ements of the names of stops in the tro@@ l@@ ley@@ bus : H@@ n@@ us@@ á@@ č@@ kova , P@@ ří@@ zrak , F@@ ráz@@ ova , Spra@@ te@@ c@@ ká .
for sure , the tro@@ l@@ ley@@ bus was a bit no@@ isi@@ er , so the male voice making the announc@@ ements was somewhat less easy to understand than before , when the stops were announced by a female voice .
the female voice is higher-@@ pit@@ ched , so in the deeper no@@ ise of public transport it '@@ s easier to pick out than the deeper male voice .
while the public transport company argues that the voice was chosen by passen@@ gers themselves - I do n@@ '@@ t know which ones , they did n@@ '@@ t ask me - they must have chosen it from studi@@ o record@@ ings made in complete silence , which obviously soun@@ ded completely different than against the ra@@ ck@@ et of a bus engine .
I '@@ ve lived in Br@@ no for quite a few decades now , so I know the correct names of all those stops off by heart and obviously I do n@@ '@@ t need these announc@@ ements , but people from other places who do n@@ '@@ t know their way around Br@@ no , and at whom these announc@@ ements are mainly aimed , might be confused , and if they go to the final stop by mistake , they can claim that the stop they were meant to get off at was n@@ '@@ t announced .
maybe they should run the selection process for an announc@@ er again , this time with the addition of transport no@@ ise and the ra@@ ck@@ et of a motor , in which the mut@@ ter of the bus lou@@ d@@ speaker almost gets lost .
then I would n@@ '@@ t have to listen to stops called V@@ odní Her@@ šp@@ ice , Š@@ mírov@@ a , or Pon@@ or@@ ná in the scre@@ ech@@ ing tra@@ m that I got onto at Kom@@ á@@ rov .
in my old age I do n@@ '@@ t think that my hearing got that much worse in the single day when they changed the announc@@ er .
before that day I understood the announc@@ ements quite well .
good morning , com@@ ra@@ de super@@ inten@@ dent
notes by a rail@@ way worker
few people today know what the so-called complex checks were during the rule of the biggest , smar@@ test political party .
let me reminis@@ ce .
the bus was delayed .
I entered the dispat@@ cher '@@ s office at the moment the radio announced that it was seven o@@ '@@ clock .
`` You '@@ re lucky you did n@@ '@@ t bu@@ mp into the com@@ ra@@ de super@@ inten@@ dent , he got here a minute before you and he did n@@ '@@ t look like he was in a great mood , '@@ ' noted the dispat@@ cher while I was writing my name in the visitors ' book .
thanks , I '@@ ll be careful .
write that I '@@ ve going through the districts to review minor mechanical devices .
ca n@@ '@@ t do it - the checks are on today .
we '@@ re all cra@@ pping ourselves because of it , it '@@ s terrible .
what '@@ s it all about ?
`` You '@@ ll see , '@@ ' said the dispat@@ cher , making a face .
you will next time , too .
I ran out to the corrid@@ or .
at that moment the doors to the super@@ inten@@ dent '@@ s office opened and the super@@ inten@@ dent appeared .
B@@ ut@@ ton@@ ed@@ -up , with a st@@ ony face and perfectly f@@ itted uniform .
`` Go@@ od morning , com@@ ra@@ de super@@ inten@@ dent , '@@ ' I greeted him respec@@ tfully , quickly doing up the two bu@@ tt@@ ons of my uniform jack@@ et .
`` Go@@ od morning , '@@ ' he replied and I quickly ran up to the first floor , without notic@@ ing the cold , fore@@ bod@@ ing tone that the older man had replied in .
`` You '@@ re just playing , '@@ ' I was welcomed by engineer Ev@@ a , an elderly la@@ dy for whom I had a lot of respect .
apparently she '@@ d even been the super@@ inten@@ dent until she was removed by the com@@ ra@@ des .
we '@@ ve got checks on and you only just make it .
how many times had I asked what these complex checks were , but no-@@ one wanted to talk about it .
apparently they only happen once every three years , everyone has to attend them , and they '@@ re quite unpleasant .
at least for some .
well , they said I '@@ d see .
I pulled a file with periodic announc@@ ements out of a dra@@ wer . at that moment the phone ran@@ g .
`` Hol@@ c@@ man here , come to my office immediately , '@@ ' said the super@@ inten@@ dent '@@ s voice .
what '@@ s his problem ?
we met each other now and nothing ... '@@ ' I mu@@ mbled , but no-@@ one answered , all of them lost in their thoughts .
`` hel@@ lo , com@@ ra@@ de super@@ inten@@ dent , here on your orders , '@@ ' I reported , barely inside the super@@ inten@@ dent '@@ s office .
the super@@ inten@@ dent was sitting behind his de@@ sk , looking over some pap@@ er@@ work .
`` Com@@ ra@@ de mechan@@ ic , '@@ ' he announced after a moment , without raising his head and still carefully scan@@ ning the pap@@ er@@ work , `` your behavi@@ our does not please me at all . '@@ '
he threw the pap@@ er@@ work down on the table , lean@@ ed on the arm@@ rests of his chair and looked at me with a fixed , unpleasant , spi@@ teful , pi@@ er@@ cing look .
I became dis@@ concerted .
what '@@ s up ?
only yesterday his deputy was pra@@ ising me , saying that I '@@ d settled in very well in my few months in the job and that he was happy with me to the highest possible degre@@ e@@ ,
and that the super@@ inten@@ dent had done very well when he pulled me out of the track brig@@ ade .
and now this ?
you must re@@ ali@@ se that you are a rail@@ way track techn@@ ici@@ an and you must behave accordingly .
the type of gre@@ eting that you used this morning was simply unacceptable .
I st@@ am@@ mer@@ ed that I '@@ d used this gre@@ eting since childhood , that that was how I '@@ d been brought up and that I did n@@ '@@ t see anything wrong with it .
it was like a red ra@@ g to a bul@@ l for the super@@ inten@@ dent .
`` You work on a socialist rail@@ way and the only acceptable gre@@ eting is ` čest práci ' -LRB- ` hon@@ our to work ' -RRB- , '@@ ' sna@@ pped the super@@ inten@@ dent .
and furthermore , you '@@ re still mix@@ ing up gre@@ et@@ ings to your superi@@ ors .
one minute you say ` Mr ' and the next it '@@ s ` Com@@ ra@@ de ' .
to you , I '@@ m not Mr Sup@@ er@@ inten@@ dent , but Com@@ ra@@ de Sup@@ er@@ inten@@ dent .
deputies are com@@ ra@@ de deputy , head track maintenance supervisors are to be addressed as com@@ ra@@ de track maintenance supervis@@ or !
now kin@@ dly remember that !
I '@@ m sorry , Mr ... com@@ ra@@ de super@@ inten@@ dent , but ... but I greeted you with a normal , everyday gre@@ eting .
there '@@ s nothing bad about that , after all ... and that hon@@ our to work , or com@@ ra@@ de ... you know ... I '@@ m not in the Party ...
`` That is n@@ '@@ t one of your virtues , that you are n@@ '@@ t in the Party , '@@ ' declared the super@@ inten@@ dent col@@ dly , having cal@@ med down slightly in the meantime .
you '@@ ll hear more about that later .
in any case , bear in mind that you have n@@ '@@ t got that chair up@@ sta@@ irs reserved until you retire .
that was n@@ '@@ t good .
when the super@@ inten@@ dent told someone that something was n@@ '@@ t one of their virtues , the prospects were n@@ '@@ t good for whoever was on the receiving end .
for a moment he looked at me with a cold , pi@@ er@@ cing look and I search@@ ed for words to answer him with .
I was also an@@ no@@ yed by the way he arrog@@ antly addressed me in the familiar form .
he was only a few years older than me and acted like my lor@@ d and master - actually , com@@ ra@@ de and master .
J@@ ov@@ ial , pu@@ ff@@ ed@@ -up , authoritarian , arrogant , whatever suited him at any given moment .
we all used the formal form to address him .
so be it , he '@@ s the super@@ inten@@ dent .
actually , not everyone did , the chairman of the Party organis@@ ation used to the familiar form to address him , and non-@@ party members , too .
the super@@ inten@@ dent , however , addressed many people in the familiar , especially those to whom he could apply his superiority .
right now he was putting me down for what was a lot of rub@@ bi@@ sh .
I thought something about an ar@@ se and it was as much as I could not do to sh@@ out it in his face -
except that would mean that I would n@@ '@@ t even return to p@@ ick@@ ax@@ e work on the line , never mind become a rail@@ way official .
how would I support two children ?
and the half-@@ built house !
I was ready to cry , but I controlled myself .
I would n@@ '@@ t give him that pleasure .
`` That '@@ s all for now , you can go , '@@ ' the super@@ inten@@ dent ended the audience and started again carefully examining the pap@@ er@@ work that he '@@ d had in his hand before .
they summon@@ ed me at half past ele@@ ven .
everyone from the office was already there and when I asked what was going on they replied , ye@@ ah , it '@@ ll be fine .
only J@@ ož@@ in said cau@@ st@@ ically how it had been his habit that they could n@@ '@@ t fire all of us because the com@@ ra@@ de super@@ inten@@ dent would have to do the work himself with his mini@@ ons , and there was no risk of that .
here , he emphasi@@ sed the word ` com@@ ra@@ de ' , as if he knew what the super@@ inten@@ dent had put me down for in the morning .
it was quite the meeting in the super@@ inten@@ dent '@@ s office .
the com@@ ra@@ de super@@ inten@@ dent was sitting behind his de@@ sk and behind the other de@@ sk were other com@@ ra@@ des who were to decide on my future as a civil serv@@ ant .
the vet@@ ting officer , chairman of the revolutionary trade@@ s-@@ union committee , the rec@@ order from the sta@@ ff@@ ing department , the cler@@ k for special purposes , something like a counter@@ intelligence officer in the army , and the deputy , my boss .
and the most important person , the chairman of the Party organis@@ ation .
I knew him from the rail@@ way line .
a normal rail@@ way worker , who pac@@ ked sle@@ ep@@ ers and shov@@ eled gra@@ vel .
and also a former guard .
there were ru@@ m@@ ours that back then there was no jo@@ king with him , he was a proper mon@@ ster .
cro@@ oked ton@@ gues claimed that he '@@ d left school after seven years , had n@@ '@@ t lear@@ n@@ t anything , could n@@ '@@ t do anything .
and when they closed the jail he ended up with a p@@ ick@@ ax@@ e working on the rail@@ way line .
but a com@@ ra@@ de , yes , he was a dy@@ ed-@@ in-@@ the-@@ wo@@ ol com@@ ra@@ de !
the super@@ inten@@ dent instruc@@ ted me to sit down .
I had but@@ ter@@ flies in my stomach and a lu@@ mp in my thro@@ at .
the vet@@ ting officer read the assessment from the civic committee from my place of residence .
I come from a working-class family , I am married , have two children and so on and so on .
so far so good , I thought and breath@@ ed just a little bit better .
then the assessment from the Party '@@ s street organis@@ ation .
this was a repeat of the assessment from the civic committee , perhaps they were written by the same person .
but then it came !
parents long-term members of the Party , refused to attend the chec@@ king committee and subsequently left the Party , allegedly for health reasons .
the super@@ inten@@ dent looked at me sharply .
the vet@@ ting officer noticed this and stopped reading .
the super@@ inten@@ dent instruc@@ ted him to continue .
it only got worse after that .
I had been a member of the town committee of the Union of Socialist You@@ th , where I was chosen as a Party candidate .
irrespective of my parents , who had left the Party , the Party put its trust in me .
but I got married and , apart from at the national committee offices , I also had a ceremony in a church .
I '@@ d let down the Party '@@ s trust in me in the worst way possible .
because of this I had been removed from their list of candidates .
but it was n@@ '@@ t enough !
I had both of my children ch@@ rist@@ ened , and when my mother died , I even organ@@ ised a church fun@@ eral for her , even though she was a former Party member .
in doing all of this I was showing a negative attitude to the Party .
once the vet@@ ting officer had finished reading , only the tap@@ ping of the super@@ inten@@ dent '@@ s pen@@ c@@ il on the table interrupted the tense silence .
everyone looked at me fix@@ edly and I wished I was somewhere very far away .
during this I had constantly been sil@@ ently repeating to myself `` Communists - super@@ people , Communists - super@@ people . '@@ ' What had I got myself into ?
why had n@@ '@@ t I stayed with the black@@ smi@@ ths ?
I could have fixed points without any bloody checks .
but now ?
my career as a rail@@ way officer had finished earlier than it had started .
return to the brig@@ ade ?
that probably wo n@@ '@@ t work , the super@@ inten@@ dent '@@ ll definitely kick me out for an hour .
`` Com@@ ra@@ de , how did you vet the com@@ ra@@ de under discussion here ? '@@ ' the super@@ inten@@ dent interrupted the tense silence with a question directed at the vet@@ ting officer .
well , according to the assessment from his previous employment .
do you have it here ?
the vet@@ ting officer was visibly in two minds .
there were be@@ ads of swe@@ at on his temp@@ les and he was blin@@ king nerv@@ ously , as if he himself was being vet@@ ted .
he no@@ d@@ ded eagerly and passed a piece of paper to the super@@ inten@@ dent .
`` Well , '@@ ' declared the super@@ inten@@ dent with a hint of j@@ ovi@@ ality , which was , however , often the harbinger of a storm .
at first glance nothing but praise , gradu@@ ated with distinction , studied industrial college , worked on commission as a lo@@ ck@@ smi@@ th , met the quota with an average of one hundred and twenty percent .
except the important stuff was missing .
where did you get that assessment from , com@@ ra@@ de ? '@@ ' he again turned to the vet@@ ting officer , who felt as if the situation was starting to turn against him and that very soon he might not be a vet@@ ting officer .
the com@@ ra@@ de gave it to me when he joined us .
is that sufficient ?
`` Well , when he joined us , we went to do brig@@ ade work in the district , '@@ ' bab@@ bled the vet@@ ting officer .
and there they do n@@ '@@ t ask for assessments , his was a kind of extra , so I put it into his fol@@ der .
`` So when you were put in a technical job this slip of paper was enough , '@@ ' said the super@@ inten@@ dent dr@@ ily .
the vet@@ ting officer b@@ linked nerv@@ ously and could n@@ '@@ t quite bring himself to answer .
`` It does n@@ '@@ t matter , we '@@ ll discuss it next time , '@@ ' said the super@@ inten@@ dent , closing the matter . the vet@@ ting officer was visibly relieved .
he '@@ d managed it for the time being .
`` W@@ hat@@ s wrong with you , com@@ ra@@ de ? '@@ ' asked the super@@ inten@@ dent , turning to me .
suddenly he was addressing me in the formal , so I '@@ m finished !
my vision went dark and I started feeling hot .
there followed a tor@@ rent of rebu@@ kes and accusations and I knew that I was the most repu@@ gnant cre@@ ature on Earth , who did n@@ '@@ t deserve the sligh@@ test mercy .
in giving him this incomplete assessment I had led the com@@ ra@@ de vet@@ ting officer into error and not understood why the assessment was incomplete when I got it from the vet@@ ting officer at the factory .
also that I was an anti-@@ socialist element who , at the time of the building of socialist realism had supported the wh@@ ir@@ l of religious ob@@ s@@ cur@@ anti@@ sm , na@@ y , taken part in it .
that I had committed many things , or was maybe committing now , and I sil@@ ently pra@@ yed for it to be over .
it was all one to me now .
I did n@@ '@@ t care that I '@@ d be thrown out of my position as a mechanical officer .
I did n@@ '@@ t care that they '@@ d take my p@@ ick@@ ax@@ e away from me .
that '@@ s work for honest , decent people , not for enemies of the people , as I was in the eyes of the com@@ ra@@ de super@@ inten@@ dent .
`` That will be enough , com@@ ra@@ de super@@ inten@@ dent , '@@ ' said the Party chairman suddenly , empha@@ tically interrup@@ ting the super@@ inten@@ dent '@@ s lecture .
here the com@@ ra@@ de had made a mistake , a massive mistake .
mistake ? it was nothing but idi@@ o@@ cy !
and he got his punishment !
do n@@ '@@ t forget that , com@@ ra@@ de super@@ inten@@ dent !
what can be worse for a young person than to close his doors to the party for a while !
to open them again , he would have to prove that he had changed , that he is again worthy of our trust .
the une@@ du@@ cated guard spoke like a book .
where did that come from ?
is he that well-@@ read or was he par@@ ro@@ ting phra@@ ses from Party training courses and meetings ?
that '@@ s why we must give that young com@@ ra@@ de a chance !
a chance to show that he has changed .
and who else should give him that than you , com@@ ra@@ de super@@ inten@@ dent ?
it is your responsibility to support this young , yes , somewhat confused com@@ ra@@ de in his efforts to reform !
it is your responsibility as a Party member , of which no-@@ one can absol@@ ve you !
in fact , it the responsibility of us all as Party members .
here the com@@ ra@@ de must see that the Party has not forgotten us .
that , as a caring mother , it does not just punish , but also love .
once the chairman had finished , no-@@ one said a word .
N@@ o-@@ one had expected such a turnaround in the situation .
least of all me .
`` I agree with you entirely , com@@ ra@@ de chairman , '@@ ' said the super@@ inten@@ dent ic@@ ily , no@@ d@@ ding in agreement , trying to take back the initiative .
if you had let me finish , then you would have heard that I was getting to exactly this conclusion .
everyone no@@ d@@ ded their heads in agreement , but you could see that they did n@@ '@@ t believe a single word .
`` So I was confirmed in the position of independent cler@@ k for the care of basic resources , '@@ ' I who@@ op@@ ed when I returned to the office , immediately bursting into tears .
it was good that , apart from engineer Ev@@ a , everyone was at lunch .
she sil@@ ently listened to my incoherent description of my recent experiences , during which time I cal@@ med down .
once I '@@ d finished , she asked if I wanted a coffee .
without waiting for an answer , she put water to bo@@ il and got the mu@@ gs ready .
during this she talked about vet@@ ting practices .
about how they '@@ d give you one assessment , often full of praise , and they '@@ d send the second one , full of dir@@ t , to your new employer .
however , I did n@@ '@@ t end up where I should have done , but with a p@@ ick@@ ax@@ e on the rail@@ way line , so the com@@ ra@@ des from the factory did n@@ '@@ t know where to send it .
and our vet@@ ting officer ?
he '@@ ll be worrying about where he '@@ d eat or drink what , and eventually it turned out the way it did .
`` He '@@ ll catch it from the old man , '@@ ' she noted mal@@ ici@@ ously .
he definitely wo n@@ '@@ t enjoy it today .
be careful around him though , he '@@ s quite venge@@ ful .
and the Party chairman ?
basically much worse than the super@@ inten@@ dent , no altru@@ ist .
a zero with a p@@ ick@@ ax@@ e has great power .
the water for the coffee was starting to bo@@ il and the office soon filled with the scent of fre@@ shly poured coffee .
I threw a sugar cu@@ be into the mu@@ g and sil@@ ently mixed the hot bre@@ w .
perhaps I was out of the wo@@ ods .
they would n@@ '@@ t fire me now , and the next checks would n@@ '@@ t be for three years .
in any case , the com@@ ra@@ de super@@ inten@@ dent would n@@ '@@ t let me forget this day just like that .

village symbol comes to life
after years of in@@ activity , the whe@@ el of the Ch@@ lum wind@@ m@@ ill is again turning .
situ@@ ated on a fif@@ teen@@ -@@ metr@@ e high ma@@ st , it can be seen for miles around .
people from the surrounding area call it the ` Ch@@ lum fan ' .
the wind@@ m@@ ill even found its way onto the co@@ at of arms of the village , population 150 , which it was awarded in 2010 for the community '@@ s hom@@ ec@@ oming gathering .
`` B@@ ack then we applied for a co@@ at of arms , and obviously we wanted the ` fan ' on that - everyone in the area knows it , '@@ ' says village mayor Ji@@ ří Ma@@ šek .
the Ch@@ lum wind@@ m@@ ill is a local technological monu@@ ment .
one could also say that it is a mem@@ en@@ to of the present : it serves as a reminder of the time when the local people fought for good@@ -@@ quality dr@@ ink@@ ing-@@ water@@ ,
which in the past was a rare occurrence in Ch@@ lum .
it was only in 1910 that the local council settled on a solution that served them well until the mid-@@ 1980s :
a seven@@ -@@ metr@@ e well was du@@ g in the village , which lies near the tur@@ n-@@ off to Čí@@ chov .
three years later the well was supplemented with a metal structure and wind@@ -@@ powered pump for pu@@ mping water into the reservo@@ ir at the highest point of the village , close to the church .
`` The structure was built by the firm of An@@ ton@@ ín K@@ un@@ c from H@@ ran@@ ice na Mor@@ avě at a cost of 2,@@ 400 crow@@ ns , '@@ ' states the pla@@ que on the en@@ closure of the ma@@ st structure .
after several repa@@ irs and falls of the wind@@ whe@@ el , the pump reached the end of its life@@ span in 1971 .
7 May 1973 saw the opening of a new chapter in the fight for water : on this day a new pipeline started serving Ch@@ lum .
the wind@@ -@@ powered pump remained merely a non-@@ functioning symbol of the village and local r@@ arity .
the village '@@ s dominant feature was put into operation at this year '@@ s hom@@ ec@@ oming gathering .
it was only in 2008 that the local inhabitants decided to repair the wind@@ whe@@ el and put it back into operation
and a replic@@ a of the original whe@@ el - smaller by half a metr@@ e - was ordered .
the whe@@ el was mounted on a ma@@ st , which however had to be dismantled in the same year
as the producer of the whe@@ el chose an un@@ suitable material , meaning that the whe@@ el was unable to resist gu@@ sts of wind .
the structure then laid under a ro@@ of , dismantled , for several years .
however , as of this year the whe@@ el , mounted on a high ma@@ st , is again turning .
on the occasion of the hom@@ ec@@ oming gathering the village had the replic@@ a whe@@ el modified and re-@@ mounted on top of an iron to@@ wer .
however , the whe@@ el only pu@@ mps water from the well to a blind sp@@ ill@@ way .
in the summer we dis@@ connected it totally because there was n@@ '@@ t enough water in the well .
it pumped empty .
`` In the autumn we '@@ ll then dis@@ connect the sh@@ af@@ t of the pump wind@@ whe@@ el in the suc@@ tion basket again , '@@ ' said Ma@@ šek .
Ch@@ lum is n@@ '@@ t the only village in the Czech Republic that has a wind@@ whe@@ el its co@@ at of arms ; however , it is the only village of this type in the whole of the Vy@@ so@@ č@@ ina region .
a similar element , hon@@ our@@ ing a local technological monu@@ ment , can be found in the co@@ ats of arms of e.g. Ch@@ val@@ kov@@ ice and Z@@ el@@ ená H@@ ora near V@@ yš@@ kov , Ku@@ žel@@ ov near Hod@@ on@@ ín , Part@@ ut@@ ov@@ ice near P@@ ř@@ er@@ ov and Poli@@ ce near V@@ se@@ tí@@ n .
no hard feelings , but I '@@ ve never heard of Laf@@ ata , admits Tri@@ poli@@ s main@@ stay Go@@ ian .
`` I remember the match against S@@ la@@ via very well , and my goal , like all in my career , '@@ ' laugh@@ ed 34 year-old Go@@ ian and the pre-@@ match press conference .
back then our co@@ ach was G@@ he@@ or@@ gh@@ e H@@ ag@@ i , we were un@@ lucky to lose .
I hope that I score a goal against S@@ par@@ ta now , too .
just that this time we wo n@@ '@@ t lose , '@@ ' continued Go@@ ian .
Go@@ ian has played 60 international matches for Romania and is a key player for the Greek team .
playing as a swe@@ ep@@ er , Go@@ ian will face attacks by the S@@ par@@ ta stri@@ kers .
a few thousand people will turn up , no hell , said S@@ par@@ ta player Hy@@ b@@ š on the du@@ el with the Greek team .
he also has some idea of what awa@@ its on T@@ hur@@ sday .
I know Fat@@ ai well - he played with my brother Lu@@ ci@@ an for A@@ stra in Romania .
back then I saw all their games .
I know that he '@@ s a very good strik@@ er , that '@@ s also why he went to S@@ par@@ ta , said Go@@ ian .
Go@@ ian did not mention any other S@@ par@@ ta players by name , and was then asked directly if he knew about David Laf@@ ata , S@@ par@@ ta cap@@ tain and top scor@@ er in the history of the Czech league .
Go@@ ian smi@@ led at this and directed a mil@@ dly repro@@ ach@@ ful look at the Czech journalists .
he had a helpless look on his face , as if to say : `` Why are you asking me about that ? '@@ '
after a moment of silence he spoke .
we '@@ ve seen a few vide@@ os and we '@@ ve seen that S@@ par@@ ta plays very much as a team .
it has some really good players .
and Laf@@ ata ?
no hard feelings , but I do n@@ '@@ t know anyone else apart from Fat@@ ai .
the S@@ par@@ ta players , on the other hand , know very well about Go@@ ian .
`` He has experience with bigger clubs , you could say that he keeps A@@ ster@@ as '@@ s defence going , he organis@@ es their play , '@@ ' noted S@@ par@@ ta assi@@ stant co@@ ach Stan@@ islav He@@ j@@ kal .
while Go@@ ian has his best years behind him , he can bo@@ ast a very interesting football C@@ V .
in previous times he attracted interest from Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mund , St@@ ut@@ t@@ g@@ art and both Manchest@@ er teams - United and City - but when he left Ste@@ au@@ a Bucharest he signed for Italian club Pal@@ er@@ mo . he also played for Gla@@ s@@ go@@ w R@@ ang@@ ers .
we '@@ re expecting an unusual , aggressive style , says the co@@ ach .
S@@ par@@ ta is a big team , they regularly play in European competition , they compete for victory in the Czech league .
for me they are the fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes in this game , but we are playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result .
we will try to win , just like S@@ par@@ ta , said Go@@ ian .
I '@@ m sharing a room with Slov@@ ak go@@ ali@@ e Tom@@ á@@ š Ko@@ š@@ ický , who '@@ s really looking forward to playing the Czech team .
me too .
but I can say for the whole team that we will fight hard .
Kof@@ ola to move from Poland to the Czech Republic , considering entering the Prague stock exchange .
new headquarters would be in O@@ strava .
due to trading in company shares on the Warsaw stock exchange , Kof@@ ola S@@ .@@ A was registered in Poland .
our primary goal is to have the group headquarters in the Czech Republic .
the steps that we have so far taken in this project are primarily of a legal and administrative nature and do not have a real impact on events within the company , says Daniel Bur@@ y@@ š , CF@@ O of the Kof@@ ola group .
`` shareholders are considering the listing of the company on the Prague stock exchange in relation to the moving of the company '@@ s headquarters . '@@ '
due to its listing on the Prague Sto@@ ck Exchange the company is completing a pro@@ spec@@ tus , which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future .
the moving of the headquarters of the holding company and the related share transfers will take the form of a non-@@ public transaction in which only existing shareholders will participate .
no shares will therefore be offered to the public or new investors as part of this transaction .
`` A@@ ny offering of shares to new investors would take place - if so decided by the company and its shareholders - at a later stage , either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or the first quarter of 2016 , '@@ ' stated the company .
the firm had previously stated that any share offer would consist of the issuing of new shares or the sale of existing shares .
this offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and in Poland , including the placing of shares on the Warsaw stock exchange .
Czech Tele@@ vision objec@@ tivity test on level of inform@@ ed@@ ness about the migrant crisis
another short test of the objec@@ tivity and balance of news on the refugee crisis supplied by the main Czech media .
this time it focuses on Czech Tele@@ vision '@@ s main news program@@ me .
how did it fare ?
when they '@@ re teaching journalism students about how the media manipu@@ lates reality , they could show them today '@@ s edi@@ tion of Czech Tele@@ vision '@@ s `` U@@ dá@@ losti '@@ ' program@@ me .
about 80 % of the program@@ me was devoted to the migrant crisis .
apart from the first minute , when C@@ T reported on unrest on the Ser@@ bi@@ an-@@ Hungarian border and it eup@@ hem@@ ist@@ ically said that migrant attacks on police was a case of them losing their patience -LRB- they threw stones and used metal bars -RRB- , it was a case of the current pro-@@ migrant propaganda - judge for y@@ ourselves by the tit@@ les of individual reports .
criticism of NGOs - lots of space given to non-@@ profit organis@@ ations that critici@@ se the bad treatment of migrants .
Syrian children in Czech school - story about integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic .
refugees as not only a threat , but also an opportunity
travel@@ ling of refugees - C@@ T consistently uses the term refugee , and not migrant .
what is striking is that in its stock foot@@ age C@@ T consistently uses solely foot@@ age of women and small chil@@ dr@@ en@@ ,
while in the same program@@ me , C@@ T itself stated that 80 % of migrants held in the Czech Republic are male .
summary : mostly propaganda un@@ hear@@ d-@@ of since the days of Communist ag@@ itation .
as a former journalist I must say that I '@@ m ash@@ amed of my colleagues .
ec@@ ology in practice
once when I bought a flat in a high-@@ rise I soon found that I was n@@ '@@ t the only inhabit@@ ant .
Sil@@ ver@@ fish moved into my form@@ ica to@@ i@@ let .
pet sil@@ ver@@ fish , ver@@ min with an imperfect transformation , i.e. they do n@@ '@@ t experience that transformation from c@@ ater@@ pillar to be@@ et@@ le , the young looks like an adult , just very small , and it grows .
I found them disgu@@ sting and did n@@ '@@ t shir@@ k in getting rid of them .
first by hand and then with chemicals .
the socialist@@ -@@ era chem@@ ist '@@ s gave me some blue cry@@ st@@ als to get rid of them .
I think it was called Z@@ y@@ klon B .
or something else ?
but it successfully got rid of them .
I did something similar with the P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h ants .
I used a box of ju@@ ven@@ ili@@ sing agent that would be taken by the ants would take to their nest and stop the que@@ en from producing more young .
but I di@@ gress .
as time went by , the insec@@ ts become an object of admiration for me and I increasingly came round to the opinion that they have the same right to life as us humans .
furthermore , in my experience , inter@@ fering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace another .
it '@@ s true , though , that with fle@@ as and bed@@ bu@@ gs I '@@ d have no problems worsening my k@@ arma by killing them .
at our new home my partner and I agreed that , just so long as they were n@@ '@@ t clim@@ bing around our ne@@ cks , they were free to tu@@ ck into fallen fl@@ akes of skin , invisible eye@@ la@@ shes and so on .
after a while their peaceful existence was disrupted by a sp@@ ider .
it was a normal type of corner@@ -@@ dwel@@ ler that that settled in on the ceiling .
we '@@ d thought that it lived off normal flies and mosquitoes , which only increased our comfort level .
because it was there for several years , we found out that it mainly lived off sil@@ ver@@ fish and that it evidently kept their numbers to a bearable level .
through close , regular contact while we were answ@@ ering the call of nature we found out that it was a female .
this was because we were witness to the romantic cour@@ t@@ ship with a partner that was about a third her size . we saw him carefully plu@@ ck at the web fil@@ aments so that he was n@@ '@@ t g@@ ob@@ bled up before it got to the long@@ ed-@@ for cop@@ u@@ lation .
it took about three days , during which they did n@@ '@@ t move and did n@@ '@@ t react to our checks .
below the to@@ i@@ let bo@@ wl , where the romantic games took place , we later found the dri@@ ed-@@ out remains of the male next to the female .
after that the sp@@ ider did n@@ '@@ t move for weeks on end .
when we thought it was all over , we were surprised by a large number of small sp@@ id@@ ers dan@@ gling in various places around her .
they soon disappeared .
some of them had been e@@ aten by their mother and the others had scattered elsewhere .
after a week , the female herself disappeared .
we do n@@ '@@ t know whether she went somewhere else or died , but after a month she re-@@ appeared on the ceiling .
true , it was the somewhat smaller offspring , probably daughter , of its ancest@@ or from the to@@ i@@ let .
for a while she discre@@ et@@ ly followed our behavi@@ our from the ceiling and then moved under@@ ne@@ ath the to@@ i@@ let bo@@ wl , judging our failure to attack her as friendship .
the large number of somewhat more numerous sil@@ ver@@ fish was again reduced and the sp@@ ider quietly went about its business of feeding itself .
for a whole year our ecosystem did n@@ '@@ t change .
in that time our daughter reached the age where it '@@ s embarrassing to use a pot@@ ty .
up until then we had tolerated it , but we were starting to get fed up of constantly emp@@ ty@@ ing the cont@@ ents .
we were ever-@@ more insist@@ ent in getting her to use the to@@ i@@ let .
however , our daughter used the sp@@ ider , which she had a very good view of when wi@@ ping , as an excuse to continue her bad habit .
she did n@@ '@@ t accept it all when we said that having a sp@@ ider in the house was good luck .
by c@@ rying and scre@@ aming she forced us to get the pot@@ ty out .
there was nothing else to do .
the moment arrived when the sp@@ ider had to make way in the interests of our daughter progre@@ ssing in her development .
it was up to me .
it was caught in a j@@ ar and ban@@ ished somewhere into the gar@@ den via the bal@@ con@@ y .
I par@@ ted from it as I would a friend , but after such a long time together I felt horrible , as if I was kicking out a relative .
we assumed that the sil@@ ver@@ fish would become more common and start to reproduce by geome@@ tr@@ ical progres@@ sion .
and what do you know ? - a week went by , two weeks , and we did n@@ '@@ t see a single one .
I started to speculate about the cause .
it occurred to me that , following the example of the ants , the sp@@ ider had n@@ '@@ t cultivated them there and that the environment of the to@@ i@@ let was n@@ '@@ t as fav@@ ou@@ rable to their existence as we '@@ d thought .
but then the first medium-@@ sized ones appeared and soon it was s@@ warming with them .
I had to think up another theory for their disappearance and then I real@@ ised that their connection to the sp@@ ider was that , when they could n@@ '@@ t see it , they thought that it was hiding somewhere else and that danger could come from anywhere .
or maybe they had some kind of tele@@ path@@ ic connection to their pre@@ dat@@ or and its rapid disappearance provoked some panic response in them .
I '@@ m am under no illusions about their powers of vision .
they shows some indication of being scared of the light , but never reacted to me wav@@ ing my hand or sudden movements .
our daughter now goes to the to@@ i@@ let regularly .
I think she '@@ s forgotten about the pot@@ ty .
now we just need to attract another sp@@ ider here .
I '@@ m now transm@@ itting my wish to the Internet and I have they have n@@ '@@ t turned their backs on us after that evic@@ tion .
otherwise we '@@ d have to use the Z@@ y@@ klon B .
ten statements by Albert Einstein that enriched the world .
the things said by the brilliant scientist from the last century will probably never stop fascin@@ ating humanity .
he im@@ mer@@ sed himself so deeply in everything that the results were always incredible revelations .
Albert Einstein -LRB- 187@@ 9 - 1955 -RRB- was one of the most important scientists of all time .

there is no doubt that the description itself and the system of findings in the popular theory of relativity is , for many , so complex that they prefer to use easier points of reference for learning about it .
however , it is not easy .
it would not be Albert Einstein , though , if he had n@@ '@@ t found a brilliant solution to this , too : an hour close to your loved one seems like a minute ; a minute in a hot ov@@ en seems like an hour - that is relativity .

hospitals in the Z@@ lí@@ n Regi@@ on to expect changes worth 1.5 billion .
`` It '@@ s a success when you consider that all four have been in the black for all of this year , '@@ ' stated regional govern@@ er Stan@@ islav Mi@@ šá@@ k conten@@ tedly .
the total profit of regional facilities is currently about 32 million crow@@ ns .
this is partly due to higher payments from insurance companies , and which are just as fav@@ ou@@ rable for this year .
this fact , too , shows that after some lean years , hospitals can now finally afford larger investments .
-L@@ C@@ B- preparations are therefore being made in K@@ ro@@ měří@@ ž , V@@ se@@ tí@@ n , Uher@@ ské H@@ radi@@ ště and Uher@@ ské H@@ radi@@ ště for construction work that will cost a total of 1.5 billion crow@@ ns .
the long period when we only bought instruments has ended .
now we must start to construct new buildings , as top healthcare is not possible without them , said regional deputy minister for healthcare Lu@@ bom@@ ír Ne@@ čas .
the changes are eagerly awa@@ ited in all hospitals .
building work will start next year .
a tend@@ ering process is now underway in V@@ se@@ tí@@ n for a supplier for a new pa@@ vili@@ on for internal medicine worth nearly 300 million crow@@ ns .
the addition of a dial@@ ysis unit is planned in K@@ ro@@ měří@@ ž .
Uher@@ ské H@@ radi@@ ště wants to add a new ward worth 200 million crow@@ ns to the central pa@@ vili@@ on that it opened this year .
Ba@@ ť@@ a Ho@@ sp@@ ital in Z@@ lí@@ n can look forward to the long-@@ delayed construction of a new central recep@@ tion and ward , which will cost three-quarters of a billion crow@@ ns .
in all cases these are fundamental changes that are the biggest in recent years .
`` This is an extraordinarily important step for the region as a whole , patients and doctors , '@@ ' said Vě@@ ra P@@ rou@@ sk@@ ová , director of the department of internal medicine in V@@ se@@ tí@@ n .
the five-@@ sto@@ rey building is to be ready in approximately two years and will offer comfortable facilities for internal medicine and neuro@@ logy , dial@@ ysis , new out-@@ patient wards , b@@ eds and an intensive care unit .
greater comfort for patients .
the changes , which will chiefly be noticed by patients , will affect all regions .
the new buildings will replace those in which , for example , many patients share a single room , there is only one to@@ i@@ let per floor , b@@ eds are non-@@ adjust@@ able , windo@@ ws not insulated and healthcare workers do not enjoy adequate working conditions .
`` For example , our internal medicine department was built thir@@ ty-@@ five years ago and now it '@@ s reaching the end of its life@@ span , '@@ ' pointed out Pavel Cal@@ á@@ bek , director of Z@@ lí@@ n Ho@@ sp@@ ital .
within a few years it will be replaced by a modern , seven@@ -@@ sto@@ rey building connected to the accident and emergency de@@ part@@ ment@@ ,
meaning that both doctors and patients will have all departments for acute cases in the one place , and in new premis@@ es .
construction work following the same model in Uher@@ ské H@@ radi@@ ště is already half-@@ finished .
the central recep@@ tion is already in place and will be joined by an internal medicine ward within three years .
`` Con@@ struction work will be paid through a loan and partly from our own funds , '@@ ' explained hospital director Pe@@ tr S@@ lá@@ dek .
Uher@@ ské H@@ radi@@ ště is the only hospital in the region that is able to afford its own financing .
it still enjoys the greatest profits and did n@@ '@@ t even make a loss three years ago when , for example , the hospital in Z@@ lí@@ n experienced a loss of nearly two million crow@@ ns .
`` We have good contracts with insurance companies , excellent output , we '@@ re increasing income and effectively manage costs throughout the whole hospital , '@@ ' said Vla@@ st@@ im@@ il Vaj@@ dá@@ k , who is in charge of the hospital '@@ s finances .
patients of the hospital in K@@ ro@@ měří@@ ž can also look forward to changes .
during the next ten to fifteen years up half a billion crow@@ ns are to be spent on repa@@ irs , new instruments and reconstruction .
repa@@ irs to the sob@@ er@@ ing-@@ up station will be complete this year , after which work will begin on a dial@@ ysis unit and a building to house a new magne@@ tic resonance unit .

nobody has explained to how I am supposed to keep refugees in the Czech Republic when they do n@@ '@@ t want to live here .
following a meeting with his European counterparts Minister for the Interior Milan Ch@@ ovan@@ ec -LRB- Č@@ SS@@ D -RRB- compla@@ ins that other countries are putting pressure on the Czech Republic to accept refugee distribution quotas while rejecting any discussion .
he also adds that nobody has yet explained how he is to keep allocated refugees in the Czech Republic when they do n@@ '@@ t want to live there anyway .
`` We did n@@ '@@ t get an answer , and we therefore requested that quotas were left out of the final text , '@@ ' said Ch@@ ovan@@ ec to journalists .
could you describe more specifically the position that you took into the meeting of EU foreign and interior ministers ?
we do not agree with mandatory quotas or the system , which can not work .
we can not talk about migrants as if they were bag@@ s of salt or flou@@ r .
they are living beings who have a vision , are going somewhere , have relatives .
what we wanted to hear from our colleagues was how they would keep migrants on the territory of M@@ ember States if they were re@@ distributed .
we can not imagine this .
we did n@@ '@@ t get an answer , so we requested that quotas be left out of the final text .
we did not have any problems with the other conclusions from the meeting - functional hot@@ spots , that is regist@@ ration points , the protection of borders , camps outside Europe , a trust fund for African countries and other matters .
we have been speaking about this for a year and think that this is the way forward .
but to say that quotas will solve everything ?
not long ago we were discussing forty thousand , now it '@@ s one hundred and twenty thousand .
when will it be five hundred thousand ?
and how will we keep those people in our country ?
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ eight percent of people who pass through the Czech Republic want to go to Germany .
almost no-@@ one wants to come here , we simply do n@@ '@@ t know how to keep them here .
other foreigners , Ukrainians , Vietnamese and others , for whom the Czech Republic is a destination country , have ambitions to come here ; they get asylum - but interest from this wave of migration , that is from Syria and other countries , is virtually zero .
you have said that refugees do not want to come to the Czech Republic , but we have already undertaken to accept fifteen hundred people .
would n@@ '@@ t it be possible to accept more this way ?
we undertook to accept fifteen hundred people , but with conditions .
we said : functional hot@@ spots , border protection , military operations .
what will happen with that 1500 is that 1@@ 100 of them will undergo asylum proceedings .
they will come to our detention facilities and we will treat them the same as the ones we have caught .
it '@@ s a major issue and we '@@ ll discuss with Europe whether we can hold people who are registered in Italy , Greece or Hung@@ ar@@ y@@ ,
because Europe '@@ s attitude is that if they '@@ re registered , they ca n@@ '@@ t be held .
this means that , if they enter our territory with regist@@ ration , and if there '@@ s an agreement , which there is n@@ '@@ t yet , it could be that do n@@ '@@ t even hold those 1@@ 100 on the territory of the Czech Republic and then they leave for Germany once they '@@ ve arrived .
if we '@@ re able to hold them for the duration of their asylum proceedings , we will start those proceedings .
if they are citizens of Syria or E@@ rit@@ rea , then according to European statistics 98 percent of them get international protection .
then they get documents that allow them to travel in Europe .
and I think that these people will then end up in destination countries .
then there are the four hundred people who '@@ ll be re@@ settled here .
that '@@ s the second project , which is just starting at the moment , are there we only progre@@ ssed in that we '@@ re debating with the churches about the possibilities for them finding work , accommodation and so on for them .
but that '@@ s a very long-term project .
you said that other countries were n@@ '@@ t willing to discuss the matter with us at the ministers ' meeting .
is n@@ '@@ t it more the case that , not only is the Czech Republic rejecting quotas , it is also not offering solidar@@ istic measures that could un@@ block the discussion ?
and what kind of solidar@@ istic measure should that be , in your opinion ?
if the Federal Republic of Germany issues an invitation for all refugees from Syria , that message spreads through all camps in not only Europe , but also Turkey and Jordan in a matter of hours .
it encourages a further wave of immigration towards Germany , because they do n@@ '@@ t want to come to the Czech Republic .
we think that the right path is the protection of external borders - to discourage these waves of migration , help the ne@@ edy and separate out the economic migrants .
to show them unambiguously that they do n@@ '@@ t have a chance .
fifty thousand Kosov@@ ars came to Germany last year alone .
from safe Kosovo , where we pay everything in the country , including police , the courts and state at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys .
if could separate and not accept them , and accept them solely according to economic needs , then the fifty percent of what the social security systems pay out to them for nothing could go towards refugees .
the number of people held in the Czech Republic increased the day after Germany introduced checks .
now it '@@ s eigh@@ ty , and on the first day it was twelve .
how far must it go before border checks become even more stringent ?
we were worried about capturing hundreds of people .
these are the numbers that we can manage .
we still have several hundred free spac@@ es in br@@ ick@@ -and-@@ mort@@ ar detention facilities .
obviously , everyone we catch will be returned to Austria within seven days .
that '@@ s out standard procedure .
the Austri@@ ans are the only ones who take them from us . with Hungary it '@@ s complicated and the Greeks - that '@@ s something else entirely .
where is the tipping point ?
a thousand a day ?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day .
two hundred , three hundred people on two , three consecutive days exhau@@ st our capacities sufficiently that we have to resort to crisis plans .
I have an agreement with the prime minister that we would then immediately call an emergency government meeting .
he takes a considerable interest in the whole issue , and we talk on the oph@@ one several times per day .
should that situation arise , the government can de facto meet immediately and a single ruling would decide on rein@@ for@@ cements for the police and army , let '@@ s say the customs service , and maybe the prison service .
is an extreme option the state of emergency that has been called in some parts of Hungary ?
I do n@@ '@@ t think it '@@ ll go that far here .
you must re@@ ali@@ se that we are in a different position , we are a land@@ locked state within the European Union . our one and only Schengen border is at the airport .
I do n@@ '@@ t know what would have to occur for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic . I do n@@ '@@ t want to s@@ care@@ mon@@ ger .
all the information that we have , be it from Moldova , Serbia or Hungary , indicates that the Hung@@ arians are trying to divert the flow of migration to Croatia and Slovenia , which would then mean a direct route into Austria .
this would only margin@@ ally concern the Czech Republic - hardly at all .
S@@ la@@ via pays off majority of debts at last minute
in effort to sta@@ ve off bankruptcy declaration .
the S@@ la@@ via football team has paid off its debts .
foot@@ bal@@ lers have received their money too .
the S@@ la@@ via football club was in court for the first time due to its insolvency proceedings on Tu@@ es@@ day@@ ,
almost three months after an insolvency petition for approximately 20 million crow@@ ns was submitted against it by a company called online Services from Sa@@ mo@@ a in the Pacific Ocean .
over the course of several hours , S@@ la@@ via '@@ s legal representative , Z@@ uz@@ ana M@@ lád@@ ková , tried to convince judge Micha@@ ela W@@ en@@ zlov@@ á to not declare S@@ la@@ via bankrupt .
it should be said that she did have a case .
one of the main arguments was that , the week before last , S@@ la@@ via was taken over by CE@@ F@@ C China , a large industrial and investment group from China , and Czech billion@@ aire Ji@@ ří Š@@ imá@@ ně .
S@@ la@@ via has visibly received money , at the last minute , from the new owners .
this was also demonstrated by S@@ la@@ via '@@ s statement prior to Tu@@ es@@ day '@@ s court proceedings - on M@@ ond@@ ay the V@@ r@@ šov@@ ice club paid the tens of millions of crow@@ ns owned .
`` Ever@@ y@@ thing was paid between 11 and 15 September , '@@ ' stated S@@ la@@ via '@@ s legal representative , Z@@ uz@@ ana M@@ lád@@ ková .
who did S@@ la@@ via pay the money to ?
both current and former players and commercial partners .
specifically , these included , for example , former Slov@@ ak international Milan I@@ v@@ ana and Czech mid@@ fi@@ el@@ der Mario L@@ ič@@ ka .
S@@ la@@ via also paid a fee to agent Alex@@ an@@ dr@@ e L@@ os@@ en@@ ický .
the club also paid fees due to the Prague 10 Mun@@ ici@@ pal Authority on Fri@@ day .
the insolvency dispute now de facto only involves liabilities disputed by S@@ la@@ via .
either the a@@ fore@@ mentioned liabilities did not exist in the first place or are subject to lawsuits .
nonetheless , we are prepared to pay these amounts , should we lose these cases .
M@@ lád@@ ková told the judge that `` We have the requ@@ isite funds on a bank account , which we can demonstrate through the submission of an account statement . '@@ '
`` Ever@@ y@@ thing that was due has been paid , '@@ ' declared M@@ lád@@ ková , adding that the only un@@ paid liabilities were that were not yet due , or disputed .
it is also certain that the judge will not come to a decision within the next few days and that the proceedings shall continue .
she gave S@@ la@@ via three weeks to send detailed evidence that it really has paid the a@@ fore@@ mentioned debts .
all evidence will then be assessed .
a decision will be made by November at the earliest .
the judge ordered that the proceedings continue on the third of November .
however , the decision will not be made at this meeting , but in writing following it .

Blan@@ ka could have been built so as to not collap@@ se@@ ,
but would have cost half a billion more , says expert from company that composed project document@@ ation for the tun@@ nel .
Blan@@ ka could have been dr@@ il@@ led more safely , says the expert .
the Blan@@ ka tun@@ nel complex could have been built so as to prevent the two ground collapses in S@@ tro@@ mov@@ ka park , claimed Alexandr B@@ ut@@ ov@@ ič , production manager at Sat@@ ra , chief project manager of the tun@@ nel projec@@ t@@ ,
during a press tour of the tun@@ nel on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day evening .
that would , however , have been about half a billion crow@@ ns more expensive .
the complex opens to motor@@ ists on Satur@@ day after@@ no@@ on .
it '@@ s always a compromise between cost and safety .
`` Wh@@ ile the tun@@ nel could have been dr@@ il@@ led more safely , costs would have risen expon@@ entially , '@@ ' said B@@ ut@@ ov@@ ič@@ ,
according to whom the conditions in S@@ tro@@ mov@@ ka were the same for the whole construction period ; despite this , the ground collapsed only me@@ tre@@ s from the spot where the dr@@ illing process started using a safer , more careful method .
`` If that method had been used 500 me@@ tre@@ s earlier , the tun@@ nel would have been half a billion crow@@ ns more expensive , '@@ ' stated B@@ ut@@ ov@@ ič .
three ground collapses occurred during the construction of the Blan@@ ka tun@@ nel .
Cra@@ ters appeared in S@@ tro@@ mov@@ ka twice in 2008 , and in 2010 the ground collapsed near the Ministry of C@@ ulture in Prague 6 .
according to M@@ etro@@ stav director Ji@@ ří Bě@@ lo@@ hlav , the tun@@ nel is over@@ priced , he told Euro magazine .
according to the original plans the tun@@ nel should have cost 17 billion crow@@ ns .
once VAT , which increased twice during the construction period , is included , seven@@ teen billion becomes twenty-@@ one billion .
once technology , land purchases , engineering activities , adjustments and similar items are included , the cost is 29 billion , which is n@@ '@@ t that far off 37 billion , said Bě@@ lo@@ hlav .

to get around that , users are recommended either to wait for the rush to die down , or to try and up@@ grade through i@@ T@@ unes .

Fe@@ dex earnings mixed , lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
Fe@@ dex reported disappointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its full-@@ year profit forecast on weaker demand for fre@@ ight services and higher costs in its ground division .
the company also said it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seas@@ onal workers for the holid@@ ays .
at this time last year , Fe@@ dex announced it would hire 50,000 seas@@ onal workers for the holid@@ ays .
its shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes ahead of W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day '@@ s opening bel@@ l .
Fe@@ dex Cor@@ p@@ . said that it expects to earn between $ 1@@ 0.@@ 40 and $ 1@@ 0.@@ 90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 cents from an earlier prediction .
analysts expected $ 1@@ 0.@@ 84 , according to a survey by F@@ ac@@ t@@ S@@ et .
the reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes averaging 4.@@ 9 percent , which will take effect Jan@@ . 4 , and higher sur@@ charges for ground shi@@ pment of heavy or large packages , which begin in November .
the company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-@@ cutting , higher revenue and growth in online commerce .
Chairman and CEO F@@ red Smith said the company was `` performing solid@@ ly given weak@@ er-@@ th@@ an-@@ expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . '@@ '
the holid@@ a@@ y-@@ hiring plans were announced a day after rival ups said that that it plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same that it hired last year .
in the quarter that ended Au@@ g@@ . 31 , Fe@@ dex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 , short of the $ 2.@@ 44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surve@@ yed by Z@@ ac@@ ks Investment Research .
revenue rose 5 percent , to $ 1@@ 2.3 billion .
six analysts surve@@ yed by Z@@ ac@@ ks expected $ 1@@ 2.@@ 23 billion .
Fe@@ dex has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping , which has caused revenue in its Ex@@ press unit to stagna@@ te .
but the boom in online shopping has boosted results at Fe@@ dex G@@ round .
in the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-@@ insurance .
the express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the fre@@ ight business on higher labor costs .
in pre@@ market trading about an hour before the opening bel@@ l , Fe@@ dex shares were down $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
they closed Tu@@ es@@ day down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most anticipated meeting in years , Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 2@@ 7-@@ foot H@@ ond@@ uran ma@@ ho@@ g@@ any table deciding if it '@@ s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
looming over them at one end of the central bank '@@ s or@@ nate , two-@@ story boar@@ dro@@ om will be a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that Fed Cha@@ ir@@ woman Jan@@ et L@@ . Y@@ el@@ len and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation '@@ s economic interests above all others .
the central bank has a dual charge from Congress : maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable .
but since the Great Recession , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there '@@ s an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and that third mandate could be the X-@@ factor in a too-@@ clo@@ se-@@ to-@@ predict decision , to be announced T@@ hur@@ sday , about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being we@@ aned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-@@ zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
even though most data show the economy growing solid@@ ly , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-@@ cautious Fed officials sk@@ it@@ tish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point .
`` Ob@@ vi@@ ously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch , '@@ ' said L@@ ind@@ sey M@@ . Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief economist at bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fe@@ l Nicola@@ us & Co .
`` But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further , '@@ ' she said .
there '@@ s no consensus about what the Fed will do , which in itself is causing financial market jit@@ ters .
about half of economists surve@@ yed recently by B@@ loom@@ berg predicted a rate increase this week .
financial markets , however , are expecting the Fed to hold off , with a key indicator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate , unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
on Tu@@ es@@ day , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 2@@ 2@@ 8.@@ 89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16@@ ,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week , said John L@@ on@@ ski , chief economist at Mo@@ ody '@@ s Capital Mar@@ kets Research Group .
`` It would be a surprise if the Fed hi@@ ked rates at this point in time , '@@ ' he said .
if Fed policymakers did , `` they would have to go to great leng@@ ths in their policy statement to hold financial markets ' hands so they do n@@ '@@ t panic . '@@ '
other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act .
just a month ago , the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would vali@@ date the strength of the U.S. recovery .
Y@@ el@@ len had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed .
although job creation slowed in August , labor market growth has been solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment .
wage gains have shown signs of picking up .
and although inflation continued to run below the central bank '@@ s annual 2 % target , Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices .
the economy `` can cope with higher rates , and needs them , given the tigh@@ tness of the labor market , '@@ ' said I@@ an She@@ ph@@ er@@ d@@ son , chief economist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but financial markets around the world started con@@ vul@@ sing late last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth .
the market has reboun@@ ded somewhat this month , with the Dow now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
for Fed policymakers , the market turmoil adds to the complex calculus of when to raise the interest rate .
`` absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tightening at this meeting , '@@ ' said Stephen D. O@@ liner , a senior research fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Z@@ im@@ an Center for Re@@ al E@@ state and a former Fed official .
now , he predicts they '@@ ll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
`` There '@@ s a lot of uncertainty about what the imp@@ acts on the U.S. economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post-@@ dates the developments in China , '@@ ' O@@ liner said .
the health of the global economy is n@@ '@@ t one of the Fed '@@ s primary concerns , so technically it should n@@ '@@ t be fac@@ to@@ red into its decision-making .
but , in effect , the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
the central bank '@@ s influence in recent years has been enormous .
the mere hint by then-@@ Chairman Ben S@@ . Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might `` t@@ aper '@@ ' its monetary expansion triggered market con@@ vul@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertw@@ ined , Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consul@@ t with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
its decision-making process is `` more art than science , '@@ ' said Z@@ ach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , head of global strategy for weal@@ th-@@ management firm En@@ vest@@ net In@@ c .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ ack@@ er , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mon@@ d , va . , noted this month that `` the Fed has a history of over@@ reacting to financial market movements that seem un@@ connected to economic fundamentals . '@@ '
L@@ ack@@ er , a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , cited decisions in 199@@ 8-@@ 99 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage point over three meetings `` despite limited identi@@ fiable implications for U.S. growth , '@@ ' L@@ ack@@ er said .
a year later , Fed officials reversed those cuts .
the Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market meltdown , said Adam S@@ . P@@ os@@ en , a former member of the Bank of England '@@ s ra@@ te-@@ setting committee .
the latest turmoil does n@@ '@@ t come close to that level , he said .
`` You certainly do n@@ '@@ t want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset , '@@ ' said P@@ os@@ en , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do n@@ '@@ t think they should get ahead of the cur@@ ve .

speed on motor@@ ways to remain unchanged .
the Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties has rejected a higher speed limit of 150 k@@ m@@ /@@ h .
on selected sections of motor@@ way it will not possible to increase the maximum permitted speed to 150 k@@ m@@ /@@ h in fav@@ ou@@ rable weather condi@@ tion@@ s@@ ,
decided the Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties on Tu@@ es@@ day in agreeing to the Senate '@@ s amend@@ atory proposal rejecting the speed increase .
the amend@@ ment to the roads Act will now be passed on to the president .
President Mil@@ o@@ š Zem@@ an had said at the end of April that he would veto a law to allow driving at 150 k@@ m@@ /@@ h .
also against the move was Tran@@ sport Minister D@@ an Ť@@ ok -LRB- on behalf of AN@@ O -RRB- , according to whom the Czech motor@@ way network is n@@ '@@ t yet built for such speeds .
on Tu@@ es@@ day Ť@@ ok supported the Senate '@@ s version of the law in front of the Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties .
in accordance with the original government proposal , the approved amend@@ ment now allows the increase of the maximum speed from 90 to 110 k@@ m@@ /@@ h on selected first-@@ class roads , especially four-@@ lan@@ e ones .
the Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties had originally expanded this to include motor@@ ways , on selected sections of which driving would be permitted at speeds of up to 150 k@@ m@@ /@@ h , but this was rejected by the Senate .
MPs have now as@@ sented to this proposal .
with the agreement of the Minister for Tran@@ sport , Sen@@ ators also removed the authority of the police to have the final say in the modification of local roads that are maintained by municipalities .
the Senate '@@ s version , approved by the Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties , anti@@ cip@@ ates the leng@@ th@@ wise laying of se@@ wage systems , water systems and cab@@ ling for public ligh@@ ting beneath road sur@@ fac@@ es@@ ,
saving municipalities money that would be spent on land purchases .
this would mean that municipalities would also not be required to take care of ve@@ ge@@ tation along the sides of local roads , regardless of the owner of the land .
the amend@@ ment is also intended to help improve the protection of roads and make it easier for municipalities to handle vehicles that have been to@@ wed away and that are not claimed by the owners .
municipalities would now be able to sell such vehicles if not claimed by their owners within a six-month period following no@@ tification of to@@ wing away .
municipalities will have the option of banning the transit of goods vehicles across their territory on secon@@ d@@ - and third-@@ class roads under threat of a fine , which also apply to the ha@@ u@@ la@@ ge company .
the amend@@ ment also aboli@@ shes the option of introducing electronic car tax st@@ ickers instead of paper ones , which shall therefore continue to be used beyond 1 January next year .
according to the government , this will save money on the introduction of an electronic system .
Ú@@ stí mayor to go on trial
may get 10 years for over@@ priced Lit@@ tle Citi@@ zens ' welcome .
the case concerns the allegedly over@@ priced Lit@@ tle Citi@@ zens ' welcome project .
the police also wanted to prosecute M@@ P Z@@ uz@@ ana K@@ ail@@ ová -LRB- Č@@ SS@@ D -RRB- in this case , although she was not released by the Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties .
according to the legal classi@@ fication of the case , both may receive prison sentences of up to ten years .
the main trial is currently planned for two days in October .
the indictment states that , according to the state prosecutor , Man@@ dí@@ k and Mac@@ ík caused damage to the minimum amount of one million crow@@ ns .
the prosecutor '@@ s case is based on an expert report .
according to the prosecutor , former members of the city authority used their official roles to gain assets to the benefit of the company that organ@@ ised the Lit@@ tle Citi@@ zens ' welcome .
according to the indictment , Man@@ dí@@ k ta@@ sk@@ ed the then head of the municipal services , education and culture department of the Ú@@ stí nad La@@ bem city authority with a ten@@ der process for five interconnected companies .
when another company offering the lowest price entered the competition , the authority cancel@@ led the process .
the city is then said to have ent@@ ru@@ sted the contract to an administra@@ tor and the competition was only entered by D@@ aro@@ th@@ ore , which was then awarded the contract by the city council .
the city paid a minimum million crow@@ ns more than it should have done .
both the accused , led by the goal of ensuring that D@@ aro@@ th@@ ore was awarded the public contract for the organis@@ ation of the Lit@@ tle Citi@@ zens ' welcome event in Ú@@ stí nad La@@ bem , conducted coordinated actions over an extended period of time that were , at the very least , in breach of the requirement for process that is in line with that of good management , writes the state prosecutor .
it continues to state that , at the same time , they were aware D@@ aro@@ th@@ ore , following its awar@@ ding of this contract , charged Ú@@ stí nad La@@ bem a price for the real@@ is@@ ation of the Lit@@ tle Citi@@ zens ' welcome event that was disproportionately excessive compared to the true value of services actually provided .
according to records , the company received more than five million crow@@ ns over three years .
in the end , the city only paid approximately 1.7 million crow@@ ns of this then withdrew from the contract .
according to the expert report , the amount paid was excessive by at least one million crow@@ ns .
Man@@ dí@@ k had previously denied any breach of the law .
I did n@@ '@@ t commit any criminal off@@ ence , I '@@ m innocent .
I do n@@ '@@ t understand this fabric@@ ated affair , said the already former mayor , also saying that , under his leadership , the city was only continuing a similar project from previous years .
the event was organ@@ ised by the R@@ ox@@ y II agency in the years 2008-@@ 2010 .
`` It was under the same conditions , for the same amount of money , '@@ ' added Man@@ dí@@ k .
criminal investigators originally also wanted to charge M@@ P K@@ ail@@ ová , who had also been a member of the city council .
however , the Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties did not release her for prosecution .
criminal investigators therefore ad@@ jour@@ ned the case regarding her , but anticipate charging K@@ ail@@ ová once her mandate in the Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties ends .
the Lit@@ tle Citi@@ zens ' welcome was a social event that took place several times per year .
in it , mothers received ch@@ equ@@ es worth 5 thousand crow@@ ns to buy children '@@ s goods and small gifts .
Hungarian police allegedly set a dog on a refuge@@ e@@ ,
then forced journalists to dele@@ te foot@@ age .
Hungarian police on the border with Serbia allegedly briefly detained an A@@ P camer@@ am@@ an and forced him to dele@@ te foot@@ age allegedly showing a police dog kno@@ cking a refugee to the ground .
however , this accu@@ sation is questioned by the Hungarian government .
the alleged incident occurred on Satur@@ day evening , when A@@ P camer@@ am@@ an Lu@@ ca Mu@@ zi was fil@@ ming migrants crossing the border with Serbia through a cor@@ n@@ field close to the Hungarian town of R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke .
police intervened against the refugees and one of them set a dog with a mu@@ zz@@ le on one Syrian .
the dog rolled the man , who was sh@@ ou@@ ting `` P@@ le@@ ase , please , I '@@ m a refugee , '@@ ' over onto the ground , claims Mu@@ zi .
the fact that Mu@@ zi was fil@@ ming this was noticed by one police officer , who stopped him from leaving .
the journalist was then forbidden from ph@@ oning either his superi@@ ors or his colleagues in s@@ itu .
the policemen led Mu@@ zi off to a dark room by the regist@@ ration Cent@@ re for refugees and requested that he show them what he had recorded .
they then ordered him to dele@@ te the recor@@ ding .
Mu@@ zi thus lost the results of two days ' work in Serbia and Hungary .
he said that he felt as if he was in danger due to the presence of the dogs .
A@@ P sent a letter of protest to Hungarian government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tán K@@ ová@@ cs .
in it , the agency described the behavi@@ our of the police as unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and without fear that the government would destroy legally obtained material .
with reference to the police report , K@@ ová@@ cs questioned Mu@@ zi '@@ s version of events .
he said that the police had only wanted him to show them whether they were in some pictures , to which they allegedly had a right .
when they found that they were n@@ '@@ t , they did n@@ '@@ t force him to dele@@ te anything .
`` dogs may bar@@ k - they '@@ re trained to do so to deter people and spread a bit of fear , but they certainly did n@@ '@@ t attack , '@@ ' claims K@@ ová@@ cs .
the unpredictable Ch@@ ampi@@ ons League
win at City will give us a boost , believe Ju@@ vent@@ us
`` It '@@ s disappointing , I do n@@ '@@ t think we deserved to lose , '@@ ' said City co@@ ach Manuel P@@ el@@ leg@@ rin@@ i , shaking his head .
we had more chances and played better than Ju@@ vent@@ us .
it was a classic Ch@@ ampi@@ ons League match .
neither team created many chances , but we had the ball for longer .
`` The defeat was n@@ '@@ t due to tactics , Ju@@ vent@@ us just scored two beautiful goals , '@@ ' said P@@ el@@ leg@@ rin@@ i , whose team con@@ ceded a goal for the first time in 6@@ 36 minutes of competitive action .
prior to the game , last season '@@ s fin@@ alists Ju@@ vent@@ us were in the exact opposite situation - after three rounds of S@@ erie A , the defending champions have only one point , with two goals scored and four con@@ ceded , and are 16th in the table .
for this reason , too , the turnaround at the E@@ ti@@ had was surprising .
`` This win will help us psychologically , it '@@ ll give us a boost , '@@ ' believes co@@ ach Mas@@ si@@ mili@@ ano Al@@ leg@@ ri , who lost three main@@ stays - P@@ ir@@ lo , T@@ é@@ vez and V@@ id@@ al - before the start of the season .
in Manchest@@ er they were replaced by P@@ og@@ ba , M@@ andž@@ u@@ ki@@ ć and Mor@@ ata .
`` That '@@ s true , this is a really important victory , hop@@ efully it can help us get on a winning run , '@@ ' hopes Mor@@ ata .
because when we '@@ re on one , we '@@ re among the best teams in Europe .
we were the better team in the second half , especially when we were attacking .
the players deserve this result .
`` Be@@ fore our equ@@ alis@@ er we could have con@@ ceded for 2 : 0 , but Gi@@ an@@ lu@@ ig@@ i kept us in there , '@@ ' Al@@ leg@@ ri was full of praise for go@@ al@@ keep@@ er Buff@@ on .
`` We wasted several good chances , '@@ ' said City mid@@ fi@@ el@@ der Y@@ aya T@@ our@@ é .
we '@@ ll have to put this down to experience and try and get a better result next time .
fa@@ re@@ well Angela , fa@@ re@@ well old Germany II .
before we further discuss the issue of immigrants , we should re@@ ali@@ se that the whole media hyster@@ ia is directed by profession@@ al@@ s@@ ,
both according to the needs of the media and from above .
so let '@@ s pause for a moment .
nowadays the newspapers are full of small children being carried on their parents ' arms on the du@@ sty jour@@ ne@@ ys of the exodus .
this automatically provo@@ kes feelings of guilt and sympathy in people - that is , European people .
well , it is n@@ '@@ t just desperate children coming here ; take a look at the boats landing at the Greek islands and you wo n@@ '@@ t see too many children !
the news recently has been somewhat lacking in foot@@ age of boats going towards L@@ amp@@ ed@@ us@@ a , refugees at the French border by M@@ ent@@ on , on whose beautiful you '@@ ll see thousands of young men lou@@ n@@ ging around .
most of them are young black men .
nor do you see foot@@ age from Cal@@ a@@ is , where these black and dark@@ -@@ sk@@ in@@ ned men are waiting to see if they can get through the Chan@@ nel tun@@ nel .
but that '@@ s not so tou@@ ching .
even those pictures of the primitive Christian church set up by the E@@ rit@@ re@@ ans did n@@ '@@ t make such a big impression on Europeans .
it seemed too false .
when they '@@ re talking about refugee quotas , they somehow fail to mention that it '@@ s just about those poor children from Syria , but also those sty@@ li@@ sh - for those of an older generation : fashi@@ on@@ ably at@@ tired - young men@@ ,
who with their mus@@ cles look like they just stepped out of a fit@@ ness Cent@@ re .
here '@@ s a personal experience .
this summer we were lying on the private be@@ ach of a hotel in the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus .
regardless of the fact that it was a private be@@ ach , suddenly a large group of cars arrived .
they were n@@ '@@ t exactly old ban@@ gers .
some young black people got out of them .
about thirty men and five women .
aged between 15 and 30 .
they went onto the be@@ ach , all of them dressed in desig@@ ner clothes and shoes . holding , of course , smar@@ t@@ phones .
N@@ o-@@ one ca@@ red about the fact that it was a private be@@ ach - not even the employees - Turks , Muslims ! - they were evidently afraid of them .
they took over all the sun lou@@ n@@ gers .
if you were n@@ '@@ t lying on one and were in the sea , bad luck .
they were dressed like something out of an American rap@@ per film .
hat@@ s and na@@ il on their heads , white and col@@ our@@ ful A@@ di@@ d@@ as tra@@ in@@ ers on their feet .
then they took over the local be@@ ach bar and started party@@ ing .
they took over the tables round about and squeezed in next to the sitting dark@@ -@@ sk@@ in@@ ned and white - i.e. Muslim and European - customers without asking .
mothers and children ran away from the d@@ ining pati@@ o to somewhere quiet .
the blacks who had arrived d@@ rank be@@ er straight from small bott@@ les - like in American seri@@ als ? ! - they discarded the empty bott@@ les on the be@@ ach round about them .
they were constantly sh@@ ou@@ ting lou@@ dly at one another .
not in English of course .
then they started drinking w@@ ine , also straight from the bottle .
they jumped into the hotel swi@@ m@@ min@@ g-@@ pool - in desig@@ ner swi@@ m@@ wear , especially the young ladi@@ es - scre@@ amed and sh@@ ou@@ ted in the water , while mothers and children and pensioners ran away , terri@@ fied , and after half an hour there was n@@ '@@ t a single non-@@ black person on the be@@ ach or in the pool .
everyone had disappeared .
regardless of whether they were Christian or Muslim .
the hotel employees were scared to even talk about them .
the wa@@ iter said to me in a low voice : `` D@@ id you see the gold they had on them ? '@@ '
`` Y@@ e@@ ah , '@@ ' I said .
`` They definitely did n@@ '@@ t get that from working , '@@ ' said the wa@@ iter .
I remembered : `` I know , they all had massive gold chains around their ne@@ cks .
and one had a massive gold cross , maybe twenty cen@@ time@@ tre@@ s long , on his ne@@ ck .
and the women were dressed like in a Gold@@ smi@@ th '@@ s .
`` Ar@@ e they drug smugg@@ lers ? '@@ ' I asked .
`` You saw how they were bo@@ oz@@ ing , '@@ ' replied the wa@@ iter .
they do n@@ '@@ t smugg@@ le or use drugs .
they smugg@@ le something else entirely .
then it was clear to me what they were smuggling .
however , in June 2@@ 10@@ 5 -LSB- s@@ ic -RSB- that was n@@ '@@ t yet so important to me .
I had no idea what was to follow .
but the secret services and leading politicians should be the first to know .
I do n@@ '@@ t think they would n@@ '@@ t know .
at that time about 1.5 million immigrants were on their way to Europe .
and they come and come and come .
now we have seen that the chief problem of the European Union is that it is the milit@@ antly politically correct politicians preten@@ ding to be intellectuals and the lobbying and economic groups associated with them that hold the greatest power .
Germany and its politicians - nowadays public@@ ally recog@@ n@@ ised as the main force in Europe - lie , lie and lie - and not just them , as well as EU heads of state and television , including ours .
for example , the recent television foot@@ age of the enthusiastic welcoming of refugees is on the level of foot@@ age shown on Russian television in August 1968 .
of course there were a few trendy liberals at the station , but mainly it was - established German - Muslims that were welcoming them .
for weeks on a lot of nonsense was spoken on Czech Tele@@ vision about how , according to some survey or other , almost all Germans were in fav@@ our of welcoming emigran@@ ts .
however , anyone who has spent just a few days in Germany knows that this is a massive lie .
this is confirmed by further informa@@ tion@@ ,
for example the famous public opinion survey conducted by AR@@ D , the Con@@ sor@@ tium of Public broad@@ ca@@ sters in Germany .
even a week ago it was still being claimed by AR@@ D that more than 50 % of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees .
this was also reported on Czech television .
however , they kept quiet about what broke the next day in Germany : an opinion poll showed that 9@@ 4.5 percent of Germans did n@@ '@@ t want to accept any more immigrants - 6@@ 7,000 people took part in the poll .
it is true that five years ago , in 2010 , Chancellor Merkel declared publicly : `` Our efforts to establish a ` multi-@@ cul@@ ti ' society have totally failed . '@@ '
she further said : `` Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society . '@@ '
`` All efforts for such coexistence have failed totally . '@@ '
according to Merkel , in a country with four million Muslims , the strategy that allows people from varying cultural environments to live alongside one another without integrating has not proved successful . today they live here with us and we have lied to ourselves for some time that they will not stay , and go away again some day .
this is not , however , the reality .
the multicultural approach , when we tell ourselves that we will just live happily alongside one another , has failed .
it has failed completely .
however , even Merkel probably does not have the power to oppose those holding the power in Germany and Europe , and mainly political correc@@ tness .
this is shown in the escalation of events .
conflict is rapidly increasing .
the Euro@@ ger@@ man Sch@@ ul@@ z , President of the European Parliament , M@@ EP for the SPD , is allegedly the only member of the Parliament who does not have a school@@ -@@ leaving cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate - yes , he is the one about whom Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play a concentra@@ tion-@@ camp guard - has made a spectacle of himself several times .
it appears , particularly in light of recent statement by German politicians , that Germany has crossed the Ru@@ bic@@ on .
we must take note that , apart from some , the majority of European politicians do not support these statements and that the politicians of countries that were the victims of Nazism are horri@@ fied .
what has happened to the Germans ?
the rich , successful and reliable Germans ?
those who for years tried , at least outw@@ ar@@ dly ? to come to terms with their terrible past as aggress@@ ors and murder@@ ers of millions ?
are those who say that it is part of the soul of Germany to so@@ w the seeds of aggres@@ siveness , superiority and violence , right ?
was Chancellor Ot@@ to von Bismarck right when he exer@@ ted all his powers to prevent advocates of the Greater German solution to German unification from taking control of the whole Cent@@ re of Europe ?
when he said that the Greater German idea would destroy Germany ?
probably .
once he was deposed , preparations started for the First World War .
the Greater German idea , which led the Germans and Europe into two world wars and cost millions of lives , has probably returned in another form .
following Marxist attempts to take over the country , for example with the rote Ar@@ me@@ e F@@ rak@@ tion , after the failure of the G@@ DR , a new German ideology , based for example on ec@@ ology , which was , for example , one of the chief ideological branches of Nazism , started to develop .
we could call it trendy liberal .
the German elites long prevented the creation of German nationalism , and therefore left all the fighters against atomic power , enthusiasts seeking parad@@ ise for all in peace and tac@@ itly supported the old imperial and Nazi slogan Un@@ ser Wal@@ d mu@@ ss le@@ b@@ en -LRB- ` our forest must live ' -RRB- .
to appe@@ ase the rest@@ less young people who , all over the world , want to do things differently and better , they fully went over to the side of those fighting against global warming , closed nuclear power plants , etc .
in this they for@@ got that within this stream of thought there is also a strongly antisemi@@ tic - pro-@@ Palestinian - and anti-S@@ lav@@ onic element , considering all S@@ lav@@ s to be trouble@@ some ver@@ min - that goes right back to Karl Marx , a J@@ ew by descent , who was mainly a German nationalist .
as shown in recent statements by Sch@@ ul@@ z and German ministers , openly threatening the di@@ sob@@ ed@@ ient Eastern countries , this also includes the idea of Germany in a leading ro@@ le@@ ,
and which must be listened to without ex@@ cu@@ se@@ s@@ ,
or wo@@ e be@@ tide you !
when we add to this the fact that immigrants are a highly suggesti@@ ble group of voters , we have what we have .
standing behind this is , as ever , capital , particularly German capital , which suits it and which lives off the fact that , through the banks and Union , Germany actually controls the majority of states of the European Union .
the pse@@ ud@@ ob@@ eli@@ efs of trendy liberals first led Germans into the sw@@ amp of ec@@ olog@@ ic@@ alism and multiculturalism and has now brought them , and may still bring them , millions of Muslims
who , attracted by the si@@ ren calling , will soon run up against the wall of reality that Merkel does want to see , and will start to rebel .
again , Germany can only threaten its neighb@@ ours with force , again it can ideologically cap@@ tiv@@ ate part - and it appears that it is an increasingly small part - of its population ; however , reality will , as ever , catch up with it .
will Germany burn again ?
Muslim shel@@ ters are already burning .
what will the German government do when public protests break out in Germany against the coming Islamists ?
Islamists who will be aided by Muslims who have been living in Germany for years , but have not been integrated so that they accept local habits and laws ?
what will the German government do when it admits natur@@ al@@ ised Muslims , Islamists who have arrived in the country and Germans , following the Isla@@ mis@@ ation of their country with fear ?
what will happen to Germans , and Germany itself , when people rise who lou@@ dly and publicly protest against the new Euro-@@ super@@ human , the Muslim ?
Germany has simply changed .
the conflict that it has provoked through its support of trendy liberal ideology , i.e. ideology that is elitist and , in essence , totalitarian , and of its in@@ sati@@ able banks , will grow .
and , thanks to its ru@@ de behavi@@ our towards di@@ sob@@ ed@@ ient , democratic Germans and all of its inferior , di@@ sob@@ ed@@ ient Eastern neighb@@ ours , this can not end well .
final part tomorrow .

Brazil '@@ s pedi@@ atric Society of Rio Gran@@ de promotes healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding di@@ ets
Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization S@@ PR@@ S has come up with a shocking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while bre@@ ast@@ feeding , by fe@@ at@@ uring images of babies suc@@ k@@ ling from bre@@ asts pain@@ ted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
human breast mil@@ k is composed of a variety of proteins , fats , vitam@@ ins , and car@@ bo@@ hydra@@ tes , which give babies all the nutrients they need to grow a strong immune system .
due to excess energy requirements , pregnant women and new mom@@ s are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie in@@ take by about 500 cal@@ ories per day .
however , new research suggests that increasing cal@@ orie in@@ take is not the only di@@ etary adjustment mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , a professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medic@@ ine in Texas revealed that healthy di@@ ets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors .
unfortunately , un@@ healthy di@@ ets were found to negatively affect the child '@@ s immune system .

the big news for S@@ even was the stunning de@@ but of 800 Wor@@ ds with former pac@@ ked to the Raf@@ ters star E@@ rik Thom@@ son .
the new drama , about a recently wi@@ dow@@ ed father who decides to re@@ locate to se@@ aside New Zealand with his two children , averaged a very impressive 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show sol@@ o without Raf@@ ters star Re@@ bec@@ ca Gi@@ b@@ ney .
last night '@@ s result answered that with a resounding `` yes . '@@ '

the final three agree bach@@ el@@ or Sam Wo@@ od is the perfect gu@@ y - but who will he choose ?

the woman who Sam Wo@@ od ends up with on The bach@@ el@@ or has been swa@@ thed in ut@@ most secrecy .
and the three girls left standing certainly are n@@ '@@ t letting slip whether they are the one who received his final rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah Mac@@ ka@@ y , S@@ nez@@ ana Mar@@ ko@@ ski and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ F@@ el@@ lows the day before three become two , they may have in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently given away a clu@@ e as to who the winner will be .

all three women wa@@ xed ly@@ r@@ ical over why Wo@@ od is the perfect man , citing his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and posi@@ tivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner .
however when asked the question , `` If not you , who should get Wo@@ od '@@ s final rose ? , '@@ ' their answers could have provided a spoil@@ er as to who won the B@@ ach@@ el@@ ors heart .
both Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ F@@ el@@ lows and Mar@@ ko@@ ski were quick to name Mac@@ ka@@ y as , apart from themselves , the best match for Wo@@ od .
Sarah Mac@@ ka@@ y and Sam Wo@@ od have shared an easy rap@@ port since day one .
`` F@@ rom the moment I wal@@ ked into the house , reading -LRB- Sarah '@@ s -RRB- energy and Sam '@@ s energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show , '@@ ' said Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ F@@ el@@ lows .
`` Sarah is really down to earth , she '@@ s so much fun to be around , '@@ ' added Mar@@ ko@@ ski .
I '@@ ve seen them together and they do have that chemistry there .
they do feel nice and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mac@@ ka@@ y believes she and Sam Wo@@ od would be well suited as a couple .
for her part , Mac@@ ka@@ y said last week '@@ s home visit dates made her re@@ ali@@ se Wo@@ od could be `` the one . '@@ '
`` O@@ nce I saw him with my friends and family I real@@ ised this obviously is n@@ '@@ t just a game - I '@@ m who@@ le@@ hear@@ tedly invested in him now , '@@ ' she said .
and asked who Wo@@ od should choose if not her , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .

constitutional Court supports emigran@@ ts who made claim for return of property
the couple emigra@@ ted in 1984 and their property was acquired by someone else .
as it was n@@ '@@ t possible to return their property after 1989 , the couple turned to the state with a request for compensation according to the law on out@@ -of-@@ court rehabilitation .
the court had initially awarded them the requested amount , which was over 2.8 million crow@@ ns ; however , the court of appeal altered their claim by only awar@@ ding them 90 thousand crow@@ ns , stating that damages were determined according to price regulations from 1991 .
the emigran@@ ts were supported by the Supreme Court , which awarded them the original amount .
however , the Ministry of Finance , which was to pay the money , took a compla@@ int to the Constitutional Court .
in the interim , such social and economic changes have occurred that the compensation awarded according to the stat@@ ut@@ ory regulations applicable at the time , today only cover a fraction of the value of the real estate , even if , at the time , they did provide adequate coverage .
`` This can not be held against secondary parties as persons entitled under re@@ stitu@@ tion law who are pursuing claims from at least 1995 , and who did not have the opportunity to claim compensation before this , '@@ ' said judge Jaro@@ sla@@ v F@@ en@@ y@@ k in explanation of why the Constitutional Court supported the emigran@@ ts .
`` The Constitutional Court has repeatedly advocated for general courts to approach re@@ stitu@@ tional matters for any in@@ consist@@ encies were not interpreted so as to be to the disadvantage of justified parties and for the goal of re@@ stitu@@ tion legislation to be achieved , that is to redress the injustices rela@@ ting to property that were caused by the acts of the previous totalitarian state , '@@ ' added the judge .

4 killed After Poli@@ ce F@@ ire rub@@ ber bullets at protesters in Nep@@ al
four people , including a 4-@@ year-old boy , were killed in southern Nep@@ al after the police fired rub@@ ber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country '@@ s proposed new constitution , an official said on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day .
the violence occurred Tu@@ es@@ day evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 1@@ 75 miles west of K@@ ath@@ man@@ du , the capital .
Bi@@ sh@@ nu Pra@@ sad D@@ h@@ ak@@ al , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr. D@@ h@@ ak@@ al said the police used te@@ ar gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rub@@ ber bullets .
twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why rub@@ ber bullets , which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-@@ lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death toll .
the clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nep@@ al '@@ s southern pla@@ ins , where members of the Mad@@ hes@@ i ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dil@@ ute their political influence .
there have also been protests in western Nep@@ al from ethnic T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clashes since Au@@ g .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nep@@ al , which has been centr@@ ally governed for centuries .
work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
lawmakers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in K@@ ath@@ man@@ du this week , and officials have said that the new charter could be enacted by Sunday .

Google In@@ c -LRB- G@@ O@@ O@@ G@@ L@@ .@@ O -RRB- announced a don@@ a@@ tion-@@ mat@@ ching campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations a@@ iding the thousands of refugees that have overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-@@ torn and impoverished countries .
Google took an un@@ character@@ ist@@ ically personal approach in announcing the donation drive on its blo@@ g .
rather than having an executive make the announcement , R@@ ita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experience .
`` Our journey involved many dark train and bus ri@@ des , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , '@@ ' she wrote .
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desperate for help .
the donations will go toward four non@@ profit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors Wi@@ th@@ out B@@ orders , International Res@@ cu@@ e Committee , Sa@@ ve the Chil@@ dren and UN High Commissioner for Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said it will match the first $ 5.@@ 5 million worth of donations globally at Goog@@ le@@ .@@ com@@ /@@ refuge@@ er@@ eli@@ ef until it raises $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely driven by the four-@@ year-old civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
many are also fleeing war-@@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for mil@@ dly ob@@ ese diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful
the benefits of weight loss surgery for mil@@ dly ob@@ ese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
it '@@ s still to early to say whether mil@@ dly ob@@ ese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-@@ surgical treatments , however .
`` The mortality data take a long time to show up , '@@ ' said Dr. Rob@@ in Black@@ stone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A surgery .
weight loss operations , or bari@@ atric surgery , use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body '@@ s ability to absorb food .
over the years , bari@@ atric sur@@ ger@@ ies have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies were done in people who are mor@@ bid@@ ly ob@@ ese , with a body mass index -LRB- B@@ M@@ I -RRB- of 35 or above .
B@@ M@@ I , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal between 18@@ .@@ 5 and 2@@ 4.@@ 9 .
a B@@ M@@ I of 25 or higher indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a B@@ M@@ I over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your B@@ M@@ I here : 1.@@ u@@ sa@@ .g@@ ov@@ /@@ 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan '@@ s M@@ in-@@ Shen@@ g General Ho@@ sp@@ ital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bari@@ atric surgery - ga@@ str@@ ic bypass and sle@@ eve g@@ ast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mil@@ dly ob@@ ese .
the average B@@ M@@ I among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
meanwhile , the B@@ M@@ I among those receiving non-@@ surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29 .
among those who had surgery , diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent .
in the medic@@ ally-@@ treated group , by comparison , diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent .
in addition , control of blood pressure , tri@@ g@@ ly@@ cer@@ ides , and `` bad '@@ ' L@@ D@@ L cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol `` was generally better in the surgical group , '@@ ' the authors found .
the researchers also monitored patients ' blood levels of he@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflect blood sugar levels over time .
he@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average he@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
but this better `` g@@ ly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control '@@ ' - as reflected by the improved he@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years , according to lead research@@ er Dr. Chi@@ h@@ -@@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and colleagues .
the research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery .
at the fifth year , compared to the sle@@ eve g@@ ast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y group , the bypass surgery group had lost more weight -LRB- 18@@ .@@ 7 v@@ s 1@@ 4.@@ 2 k@@ g -RRB- , achieved larger drops in B@@ M@@ I -LRB- 7.@@ 4 v@@ s 5.@@ 1 -RRB- and in he@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c -LRB- 3.@@ 1 percent v@@ s 2.@@ 1 percent -RRB- and were more likely to have complete diabetes re@@ mission -LRB- 4@@ 6.@@ 9 percent v@@ s 16@@ .@@ 7 percent -RRB- .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone , of the University of Arizona College of Medic@@ ine-@@ P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x .
in the Swedish study , ob@@ ese people who had bari@@ atric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conventional methods .
though the new study did n@@ '@@ t show a benefit in survival among surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it '@@ s reassuring for people with a B@@ M@@ I under 35 interested in the procedure .
`` This is where this paper is critical , because it says this surgery is safe in that lower B@@ M@@ I group , '@@ ' with no increased risk of death or ren@@ al disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient '@@ s B@@ M@@ I falls between 27 and 30 .
`` I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , '@@ ' she said .
I think that once they '@@ ve accumulated these genetic changes that hard@@ wi@@ red their bodies into ob@@ es@@ ity and diabetes , reversing that is really hard .
`` It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe '@@ ' - Dalai Lama - R@@ T News
Europe could not host all refugees , the Dalai Lama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees '@@ ' home countries .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Cent@@ re for compassion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies , at the beginning of his 10-@@ day visit to the UK .
he claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even contin@@ ents .
he also stressed that , however admirable , the West@@ -@@ European countries '@@ ' response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation .
`` It it '@@ s impossible for everyone to come to Europe , '@@ ' he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany '@@ s and Austria '@@ s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
`` So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , '@@ ' he emphasized .
ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of force .
the use of force has never solved these problems , '@@ ' he added .
addressing the issue of violence , the Dalai Lama also com@@ mented on George Bush '@@ s actions following 9@@ /@@ 11 terrorist attacks , claiming that the US '@@ ' violent response eng@@ end@@ ered a chain of uncontrollable events .
after 9@@ /@@ 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-@@ violence .
I know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences , '@@ ' the Dalai Lama said .
four@@ fold increase in children ing@@ esting hand s@@ ani@@ ti@@ zer in last 4 years

according to Dr. Ga@@ y@@ lor@@ d L@@ op@@ ez , director of the Georgia poison Center , hand s@@ ani@@ ti@@ zer ing@@ esti@@ on cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,@@ 2@@ 66 in 2010 to 16@@ ,@@ 1@@ 17 in 2014 .

there are stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry , gra@@ pe , oran@@ ge@@ -@@ fla@@ vored hand s@@ ani@@ ti@@ zers that are very appealing to kids .
hand s@@ ani@@ ti@@ zer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
in young children , especially , only a few squ@@ ir@@ ts can cause alcohol poisoning .
`` It '@@ s highly concentrated alcohol , '@@ ' Dr. Stephen T@@ hor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control center at University of K@@ ans@@ as Ho@@ sp@@ ital , told Fox 4 in K@@ ans@@ as City .
so you would n@@ '@@ t leave a shot of whi@@ sk@@ ey sitting around , but people will have these hand s@@ ani@@ ti@@ zers out and if kids get into it , it '@@ s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .

N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah was sl@@ ur@@ ring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room .
doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children '@@ s hospital for any signs of brain trauma , as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head , R@@ it@@ che@@ y said .
`` That was very scary , '@@ ' Or@@ tor@@ ia Scot@@ t , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah '@@ s mother , told CNN .
it could have been very lethal for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers use n@@ onal@@ co@@ ho@@ lic products or s@@ ani@@ ti@@ zing wi@@ pes short of moving hand s@@ ani@@ ti@@ zer out of a child '@@ s reach .
beyond alcohol poisoning , some s@@ ani@@ ti@@ zers have been linked to deaths .

R@@ O@@ N@@ N@@ Y De@@ ila has accepted Cel@@ tic are struggling , but the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an boss vowed to turn things around .
defeat to Mal@@ mo and subsequent Ch@@ ampi@@ ons League exit was swiftly followed by losing to 10-@@ man A@@ ber@@ de@@ en , who now sit five points clear at the top of the table .
but De@@ ila said : `` Cel@@ tic have had bad periods before and we will come again . '@@ '
now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible .
I know it is very frustra@@ ting and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .
that is the same as we are - but we have to go on .
we really , really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players much better .
to stay together now is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton wary of January transfers
despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets , R@@ ang@@ ers boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is wary of a signing sp@@ ree , insisting he does n@@ '@@ t want to disrupt the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad '@@ s unity .
the ex-@@ B@@ rent@@ ford ga@@ ff@@ er said : `` The January transfer window is very different from the summer window . '@@ '
in terms of players coming in the summer , you have that pre-@@ season period to bed them in , which you '@@ ve seen with our own group this season .
the squ@@ ad is doing really well .
sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic target Mich@@ u in retirement hint
S@@ wan@@ sea strik@@ er Mich@@ u , linked with Cel@@ tic during the transfer window , has dropped hints that he could retire when his contract with the Sw@@ ans is up .
the 2@@ 9-@@ year-old has been plagued with a trouble@@ some an@@ kle for two years , and failed to find a move away from W@@ ales in the summer .

Mc@@ In@@ nes gla@@ d to `` win ugly '@@ ' against Hamilton
Der@@ ek Mc@@ In@@ nes admits his A@@ ber@@ de@@ en side had to cling on desperately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see out a seventh successive league win that moved them five points clear of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ y '@@ s first-@@ half penalty .
Mc@@ In@@ nes said : `` There '@@ s not a team out there who has won anything , whether it '@@ s C@@ ups or le@@ agues , who have n@@ '@@ t won games like that . '@@ '
Sc@@ ots unemployment remains unchanged as UK total rises
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4@@ ,000 during the period May to July while the number out of work for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million during the same period .
Scotland '@@ s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was above the UK '@@ s rate of 5.@@ 5 per cent , the Office for National Sta@@ tist@@ ics -LRB- O@@ N@@ S -RRB- figures showed .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three month period , with the number of those in work now standing at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell over the quarter at 7@@ 4.@@ 0 per cent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 per cent .
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell , comm@@ enting on the latest figures , said : `` The government '@@ s long term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . '@@ '
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
in those 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish Labour market with employment increasing and unemployment falling .
why I '@@ m A W@@ it@@ ness At An execution In O@@ kla@@ hom@@ a
later today , barring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it wo n@@ '@@ t , I will sit in a viewing gal@@ lery in the death cham@@ ber at O@@ kla@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary as Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by lethal injec@@ tion .
he has asked me to be one of four official witne@@ sses to his death .
the invitation was first made back in January , via his best friend , and though I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day approaches , I '@@ ve come to dre@@ ad it .
so why do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
true , journalists are permitted to watch execu@@ tions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available , a m@@ ac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who will be chosen .
O@@ kla@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
whoever is picked will watch it disp@@ as@@ sion@@ ately .
I can not do that .
I will be sitting alongside Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p '@@ s closest friends , and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hours .
I like the gu@@ y .
we often lau@@ gh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say I can not be both a witness and a journalist , so I wo n@@ '@@ t be allowed a note@@ book and pen to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .
one O@@ kla@@ hom@@ a journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here '@@ s the lesson .
tell the in@@ mate '@@ s story the way he likes it , get access .
I complained to her .
she admitted that she `` could have phra@@ sed it better , '@@ ' but still thinks I '@@ m wrong to do what I '@@ m doing .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p has taken issue with some of the things I '@@ ve said and written .
he does n@@ '@@ t tell me what to write , and I would n@@ '@@ t do it even if he did .
I '@@ ve told him he can remove me from his list of witne@@ sses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be there to write about it .
if he dies , he thinks the publicity will help the anti-@@ death penalty movement .
Kim Bel@@ l@@ ware , a repor@@ ter from the Hu@@ f@@ fin@@ g@@ ton Post , will be alongside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I '@@ ve made .
I wo n@@ '@@ t go over all the details again here .
I can not say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry V@@ an Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being an ac@@ cess@@ ory after the fact .
but I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and it '@@ s from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other reporters you can turn to for that .
what you will get from me is what it '@@ s like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death .
man co@@ a@@ xed from Can@@ ning River after so@@ g@@ gy police ch@@ ase

Peter Mo@@ ody alleg@@ es ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit ra@@ cing
Peter Mo@@ ody has alleged R@@ ac@@ ing Victor@@ ia ste@@ wards attempted to plant a spy in his stab@@ les last year and threatened to quit ra@@ cing immediately .
he took aim at ste@@ wards and R@@ ac@@ ing Victor@@ ia '@@ s integrity department , alleg@@ ing they have a personal campaign against him with the late scrat@@ ching of L@@ ady T@@ at@@ ai because of a race day treatment the final stra@@ w on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day .
Mo@@ ody told Fair@@ fa@@ x Media he had always tried to do what is best for ra@@ cing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lid@@ ari '@@ s positive sw@@ ab to c@@ obal@@ t , which he can not explain .
he had bit@@ ten his ton@@ gue about the spy allegations for 18 months and did n@@ '@@ t want it `` to look like sou@@ r gra@@ pes . '@@ '
`` I was n@@ '@@ t going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once , '@@ ' Mo@@ ody said .
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home toni@@ ght and sleep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
when they start to think I '@@ m not that '@@ s when I should n@@ '@@ t be a tra@@ in@@ er .
I would then have to consider what I do with my L@@ ic@@ ence .
earlier , Mo@@ ody had dropped the bomb@@ shell in a ra@@ c@@ ing@@ .com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
`` eighteen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and D@@ r Bri@@ an Ste@@ war@@ t sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stab@@ les to offer information on what I was doing within my stab@@ les , '@@ ' Mo@@ ody said on R@@ ac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe I '@@ m a che@@ at .
if that '@@ s the case surely they should all hand in their bri@@ efs because they '@@ ve been incompetent in trying to catch me .
Robert R@@ oul@@ ston , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Mo@@ od@@ ie , current chairman of R@@ V@@ L , and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
should that make me think it '@@ s becoming personal ?
has R@@ V@@ L got a grow a set of bal@@ ls and maybe make people outside of tra@@ in@@ ers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I that bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think I am .
maybe they need to take my L@@ ic@@ ence off me and push me away and I '@@ ve got no doubt what I '@@ m saying now might make them think about that .
but I '@@ ve got to the point now where I do n@@ '@@ t care and that sad@@ den@@ s me .
that really sad@@ den@@ s me .
I will put the pressure on them and on@@ us on them to make a decision .
I '@@ ve got the support of my family and I can walk away .
the tra@@ in@@ er '@@ s frustration levels have built with the long-@@ running c@@ obal@@ t inquiry involving Lid@@ ari and the late scrat@@ ching had him saying that he could `` throw my L@@ ic@@ ence across the table . '@@ '
Mo@@ ody , best known for preparing un@@ beaten champion Black ca@@ vi@@ ar , lab@@ elled the ra@@ ce-@@ day treatment rule `` ridic@@ ulous '@@ ' after a mu@@ d or cla@@ y po@@ ul@@ tice had been applied to the hor@@ ses leg@@ s , which is against the rules .
it '@@ s against the rules of ra@@ cing .
I '@@ ve got to accept full responsibility for that , '@@ ' he said .
one of my staff mistak@@ enly la@@ ced mu@@ d on its leg .
it could have had it last night .
it could have had it yesterday , which it did have .
it had it on race day .
Mo@@ ody could be faced with a three-@@ month dis@@ quali@@ fication for the race day treatment using the po@@ ul@@ tice , which ste@@ wards have opened an inquiry into .
it is a joke .
people making these rules know nothing about the horse .
`` We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far , '@@ ' Mo@@ ody said .
C@@ obra@@ m h@@ it@@ -and-@@ run driver arrested

Melbourne S@@ tor@@ m co@@ ach Cra@@ i@@ g Bel@@ la@@ my hits back at rivals over w@@ rest@@ ling claims
Melbourne S@@ tor@@ m co@@ ach Cra@@ i@@ g Bel@@ la@@ my has called criticism of his side '@@ s tackling as `` agenda setting '@@ ' by the N@@ R@@ L '@@ s two premi@@ ership fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes .
Sydney ro@@ ost@@ ers co@@ ach T@@ rent Rob@@ in@@ son said the refer@@ e@@ es allowed the S@@ tor@@ m to `` w@@ rest@@ le '@@ ' his side during the S@@ tor@@ m '@@ s upset win in the quali@@ fying final in Sydney on Fri@@ day night .
B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos co@@ ach W@@ ay@@ ne Ben@@ net@@ t made a thin@@ ly veiled reference to the S@@ tor@@ m after his side '@@ s quali@@ fying final win over North Que@@ en@@ s@@ land co@@ w@@ boys on Satur@@ day night when he called that game a `` show@@ case '@@ ' of the ru@@ g@@ by league and said the two Que@@ en@@ s@@ land were n@@ '@@ t `` too big '@@ ' into w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bel@@ la@@ my defended his side '@@ s tackling and said they just focused on their `` contact '@@ ' when tackling .
Bel@@ la@@ my added he took confidence from having two leading co@@ aches critici@@ se his side as it meant they were concerned about the S@@ tor@@ m beating them .
`` That keeps coming up - I did n@@ '@@ t hear T@@ rent Rob@@ in@@ son bring up w@@ rest@@ ling when they beat us 2@@ 4-@@ 2 , '@@ ' Bel@@ la@@ my said on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day .
I can guarantee we have n@@ '@@ t changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques , it '@@ s just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tack@@ les and that has been the turn around for us .
T@@ rent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to co@@ ach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it '@@ s fun@@ ny how this always comes up at this time of year .
Bel@@ la@@ my challenged Ben@@ net@@ t '@@ s idea of `` exciting football '@@ ' remin@@ ding his ment@@ or that Ben@@ net@@ t '@@ s S@@ t Geor@@ ge@@ -@@ Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra dra@@ g@@ ons won the premi@@ ership in 2010 by playing `` boring '@@ ' football .
W@@ ay@@ ne is talking about exciting foot@@ y .
he made a point of comparing his game on Satur@@ day night with our one on Fri@@ day night and how exciting their game was , '@@ ' Bel@@ la@@ my said .
I remember in 2010 S@@ t George was critici@@ sed a lot for being a boring team and W@@ ay@@ ne said he did n@@ '@@ t give a rat '@@ s ar@@ se .
but now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting foot@@ y , especially his young hal@@ ves with their speed .
that '@@ s the foot@@ y you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
he made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his style of foot@@ y - not every team has two hal@@ ves like An@@ th@@ ony Mil@@ ford and Ben hunt so they can play like that .
to me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
six weeks ago they probably were n@@ '@@ t thinking of us when they get to the big games .
Bel@@ la@@ my also pointed out the S@@ tor@@ m and ro@@ ost@@ ers game was a higher scor@@ ing contest than the Bron@@ cos and co@@ w@@ boys game .
the Bron@@ cos game was probably a good game , I have n@@ '@@ t watched it yet but what was the score ? 16@@ -@@ 12 ?
our game it was 20-@@ 18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting foot@@ y ?
or is it making breaks and not scor@@ ing tries that is exciting ?
to me it '@@ s agendas .
if they are men@@ tioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
the S@@ tor@@ m have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Que@@ en@@ s@@ land co@@ w@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks in next Satur@@ day night '@@ s preliminary final at A@@ AM@@ I Park with tic@@ kets on sale from next Tu@@ es@@ day morning .
Serbian man gets $ 200@@ k bail on drug charge
a man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smugg@@ led into Que@@ en@@ s@@ land has been granted bail on a $ 200,000 su@@ re@@ ty .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic , 29 , was one of five men arrested last month after federal police trac@@ ked 100 kilograms of the drug from the y@@ ach@@ t S@@ ola@@ y , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ atu and doc@@ ked at Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic was observed meeting with his co-@@ accused at the mar@@ ina throughout the morning and later met them at the Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ ad@@ house ca@@ fe , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine , Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic '@@ s lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the ca@@ fe for an innocent purpose .
Supreme Court Jud@@ ge Peter F@@ lan@@ agan was concerned Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic was a flight risk .
he has clear connections to Serbia .
he tra@@ vels to Serbia often , '@@ ' he told the court on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day .
on the cro@@ wn case he lied to police about where he was staying .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic '@@ s mother and ste@@ p@@ father had jointly offered a su@@ re@@ ty of $ 200,000 to secure his release .
`` Hav@@ ing read the aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of both those persons , it is clear that the imposition of a su@@ re@@ ty of $ 200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them , '@@ ' Jud@@ ge F@@ lan@@ agan said .
but that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian pas@@ sports , report to police on a daily basis and adher@@ es to a 6@@ p@@ m-@@ 6@@ am cur@@ few .
Ste@@ van H@@ og@@ g used girls phone to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hi@@ les to send images
a pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile used an 1@@ 1-@@ year-old girl '@@ s phone to so@@ licit child abuse images .
Ste@@ van H@@ og@@ g took the girl '@@ s phone as she slep@@ t then log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service where he had a succession of inde@@ cent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sle@@ eping H@@ og@@ g '@@ s hand .
she looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately aler@@ ting her mother .
police attended and saw the five pictures , then analy@@ sed computers found at the address and discovered `` concerning '@@ ' web search@@ es using terms for finding inde@@ cent image of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to officers he had done it as it would `` lead pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hi@@ les '@@ ' on the internet before `` preten@@ ding he was a police officer to scare them . '@@ '
fiscal dep@@ ute E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son told D@@ unde@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : `` He said it was an addiction - that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people .
he accepted the search@@ es were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hi@@ les .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
he said he was doing it to l@@ ure them in .
he said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images .
M@@ S Rober@@ t@@ son added : `` When the girl found the messages on the phone she sh@@ ou@@ ted her mother and was shaking and c@@ rying .
she saw the inde@@ cent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and P@@ lay@@ station to talk to girls who looked way younger than him .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , of ward Road , D@@ unde@@ e , ple@@ aded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making inde@@ cent images of children on June 14 last year , bre@@ aching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
defence so@@ lic@@ itor Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g not be placed on the sex offen@@ ders register as it may be argued there was `` no significant sexual element '@@ ' to his crime .
sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ sta@@ ir Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el defer@@ red sentence until October for social work background reports .
H@@ og@@ g was granted bail in this case but was held in cust@@ ody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases .
he was placed on the sex offen@@ ders register ahead of his sent@@ encing date .
Zimbabwe '@@ s Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa '@@ s oldest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a po@@ di@@ um .
he was un@@ hurt , but video of the fall went vir@@ al on social media .
the opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against boo@@ ing Mr Mugabe during his address .
last month , they boo@@ ed and hec@@ k@@ led him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tu@@ es@@ day .
movement for Democratic Change -LRB- M@@ DC -RRB- chief whi@@ p innocent G@@ on@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt N@@ r Mugabe '@@ s address .
`` The message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it '@@ s tit@@ led ` death ' , '@@ ' he told journalists after Mr Mugabe '@@ s speech .
it war@@ ns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
the chief whi@@ p said the party , led by Morgan T@@ sv@@ an@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is `` worried '@@ ' about the threats to its politicians .
He@@ w@@ le@@ tt@@ -@@ P@@ ack@@ ard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ le@@ tt@@ -@@ P@@ ack@@ ard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-@@ saving efforts at it enterprise services business .
H@@ P is sp@@ lit@@ ting into two listed companies later this year , separating its computer and prin@@ ter businesses from its fa@@ ster@@ -@@ growing corporate hardware and services operations .
the expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.@@ 7@@ bn , beginning in the fourth quarter , H@@ P said in a statement .
`` The@@ se restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ let@@ t P@@ ack@@ ard En@@ ter@@ prise , '@@ ' said Me@@ g Wh@@ it@@ man , the H@@ P chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
`` He@@ w@@ let@@ t P@@ ack@@ ard En@@ ter@@ prise will be smaller and more focused than H@@ P is today , and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business , '@@ ' said Wh@@ it@@ man .
as a separate company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ let@@ t P@@ ack@@ ard En@@ ter@@ prise will have more than $ 5@@ 0@@ bn in annual revenue and `` will be focused on delivering un@@ rival@@ ed integrated technology solutions '@@ ' to companies , according to a company statement .
it breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill He@@ w@@ let@@ t and Da@@ ve P@@ ack@@ ard to make electric equipment , and whose Palo Al@@ to gar@@ age has been dubbed `` the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . '@@ '
H@@ P has been undergoing a massive re@@ organis@@ ation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .
the move by H@@ P , the world '@@ s second-@@ largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms , is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tightly focused firms perform better .
arsenal cap@@ tain Mi@@ kel Ar@@ te@@ ta says te@@ am@@ -@@ mates must get behind injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere ahead of D@@ in@@ am@@ o Z@@ agre@@ b tie
W@@ eng@@ er has also stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is still only September and , providing his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he can not be back playing by Christmas .
that best-@@ case scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and , given his history , his involvement in next summer '@@ s European Ch@@ ampi@@ on@@ ship is clearly uncertain .
the great shame of this latest problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished last season strongly after a separate an@@ kle injury and then looked back to his old shar@@ p@@ ness during pre-@@ season .
`` This kind of injury is not care@@ er-@@ threatening , '@@ ' said W@@ eng@@ er .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
it is nothing major .
this was just an accident .
it was not linked with his an@@ k@@ les or with the inju@@ ries he had before .
that might be true from a purely medical perspective but , as W@@ eng@@ er also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further inju@@ ries whenever any player tries to return mid@@ season .
there is also an uncomfortable pattern developing .
research by Premier inju@@ ries L@@ t@@ d records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere ail@@ ments since he made his de@@ but six years ago .
he has also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al '@@ s 15@@ 7 league games during the last five seas@@ ons .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight seas@@ ons since 2007-@@ 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury .
W@@ eng@@ er accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsen@@ al believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue .
`` S@@ ome@@ times , when you are coming back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition , '@@ ' said W@@ eng@@ er .
Jack is young enough to get over that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves .
with Arsen@@ al beginning their Ch@@ ampi@@ ons League campaign on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day night against D@@ in@@ am@@ o Z@@ agre@@ b ahead of matches with Chelsea on Satur@@ day and T@@ ot@@ ten@@ ham H@@ ot@@ spur next W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , W@@ eng@@ er is preparing to ro@@ tate his team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bel@@ ler@@ ín and A@@ ar@@ on Ram@@ sey have not travel@@ led to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ thi@@ eu De@@ bu@@ chy and Ar@@ te@@ ta are likely to start .
W@@ eng@@ er may also begin with Ki@@ er@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and O@@ livi@@ er Gi@@ rou@@ d in place of N@@ ach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
`` I try to keep the balance and give a little brea@@ ther to players who need it , '@@ ' said W@@ eng@@ er .
although Arsen@@ al are clear fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes to progress through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadi@@ um in Z@@ agre@@ b is among Europe '@@ s most intimid@@ ating .
D@@ in@@ am@@ o are also un@@ beaten in 41 matches after producing their own `` inv@@ inci@@ ble '@@ ' campaign last season .
the stadi@@ um was shaken on Tu@@ es@@ day night by an earth tre@@ mor that measured 3.@@ 2 on the Rich@@ ter .
it was the 10@@ th in Z@@ agre@@ b this year .
W@@ eng@@ er believes that Arsen@@ al have lear@@ n@@ t the lesson of last season '@@ s Ch@@ ampi@@ ons League cap@@ itu@@ lation against Mon@@ ac@@ o and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph .
`` This drive is immense , '@@ ' said W@@ eng@@ er .
it has never been done at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ F@@ est : the com@@ edy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is glaring , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever , with suicide rates am@@ ong@@ st young mal@@ es at 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-@@ 45 in the UK , and remains three times more common in mal@@ es than fem@@ ales .
in a bid to address the problem , the C@@ ampa@@ ign A@@ ga@@ inst Li@@ ving miser@@ ably -LRB- calm -RRB- announced 2015 as the Year of the male , aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high-@@ school students displa@@ ying de@@ pressive symptoms found that if the suff@@ er@@ er had a high enough percentage of `` healthy mood '@@ ' friends , their chances of recovering doubled .
equally , for those not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the chances of mental challenges arising .
but of course , for friendship to work , it needs to be accessible in the first place .
in this age of social-@@ media led communication , with its focus on style over substance , immedi@@ acy of response is often pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ed over meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun@@ -@@ loving and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term extr@@ ins@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply imp@@ acts our mental health .
and as a billion@@ aire vide@@ o-@@ game cre@@ ator explained recently , money really does n@@ '@@ t buy greater happiness .
the beauty of Fri@@ ends was that it turned this focus on its head .
each of the charac@@ ters were not defined by their work , but rather their personalities , which sh@@ one through the interaction as friends .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler '@@ s frequent hu@@ gs , moments watching football on the com@@ fy chairs , and Ro@@ ss '@@ s p@@ ining for R@@ ach@@ el , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all relate to this , even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings .
as a Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an worker explained to me : ... . '@@ ' my listening role to people feeling depressed and suicidal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference . '@@ '
often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
the old ad@@ age of `` getting on with it '@@ ' is strong , as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems . '@@ '
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term coping mechanisms .
it highlighted the little moments of male friendship .
as much as my objective , outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation , the long-term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
and so , if you attend com@@ edy Central '@@ s Fri@@ end@@ s@@ F@@ est this weekend , with the sets fully re@@ designed in celebration , why not take your friends for a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , better still , if in St@@ ar@@ bu@@ cks you see someone alone , give a smile and say hel@@ lo .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is broad@@ casting on com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the full 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ F@@ est
di Maria scores to help P@@ S@@ G sw@@ at aside Mal@@ mo
ang@@ el D@@ i Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise M@@ atu@@ id@@ i and E@@ din@@ son Cav@@ ani after scor@@ ing against Mal@@ mo .
ang@@ el D@@ i Maria scored on his Ch@@ ampi@@ ons League de@@ but to help P@@ S@@ G ease past Swedish side Mal@@ mo on Tu@@ es@@ day .
here '@@ s the match report and reaction to the game .
ang@@ el D@@ i Maria and E@@ din@@ son Cav@@ ani were on target as Paris Sa@@ in@@ t-@@ Ger@@ main began their Ch@@ ampi@@ ons League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-@@ 0 win against Mal@@ mo at the Par@@ c des princes on Tu@@ es@@ day .
di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Ch@@ ampi@@ ons League de@@ but as a P@@ S@@ G player to set the French champions on their way , but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cav@@ ani headed home in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Re@@ al Madrid and Sh@@ ak@@ h@@ tar Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just quali@@ fication for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a vin@@ t@@ age display by La@@ ur@@ ent Blan@@ c '@@ s side with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substitu@@ ted against his home@@ town team and the club with whom he started his illu@@ stri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
`` It '@@ s not easy to win at home or away in the Ch@@ ampi@@ ons League , so to win 2-@@ 0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on , '@@ ' said Blan@@ c .
it au@@ gur@@ s well .
we wanted to win and we did , although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more .
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-@@ 2 draw at home by Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x in Li@@ gue 1 at the weekend , but he was up@@ staged in the fourth minute by D@@ i Maria .
the Argentina w@@ inger was lab@@ elled as the man to take P@@ S@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchest@@ er United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Mar@@ co Ver@@ rat@@ ti '@@ s pass in behind the Mal@@ mo defence before ang@@ ling a beautiful finish past Joh@@ an Wil@@ and and into the far corner of the net .
however , if anyone then expected P@@ S@@ G to ro@@ mp to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
Mal@@ mo , who beat Cel@@ tic in a pla@@ y-@@ off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full internation@@ als on the field at kick@@ -off and , with a five-@@ man defence and two deep in mid@@ field , were stu@@ ff@@ y opponents .
but , save for a Ni@@ kola D@@ j@@ ur@@ d@@ jic shot that sli@@ d just wide of K@@ ev@@ in T@@ rap@@ p '@@ s far post in the 3@@ 4@@ th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , P@@ S@@ G let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor fin@@ ishing , not least from Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cav@@ ani just after the restart .
nevertheless , he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an Ibra@@ him@@ ovic pass that D@@ i Maria sent in a cur@@ ling shot which was ti@@ pped around the post by Wil@@ and on 52 minutes .
the second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an heading home his sixth of the season after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic had f@@ lic@@ ked on a left-wing cross from Ma@@ x@@ well .
that ended any ideas that Mal@@ mo had of coming back into the game , and only a super@@ b stop by Wil@@ and from poin@@ t-@@ blan@@ k range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el L@@ av@@ ez@@ zi had a goal dis@@ allowed right at the death .
Mal@@ mo co@@ ach Age H@@ are@@ ide later admitted P@@ S@@ G were a class above his side , the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an saying : `` Our last Ch@@ ampi@@ ons League game was in December last year . '@@ '
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level .
the quali@@ fi@@ ers are not enough .
hat@@ s off to Paris .
it was a magni@@ fic@@ ent match from them .
Glen@@ core raises $ 2.5 billion in share sales
Sw@@ is@@ s-@@ based mining giant Glen@@ core , hit by collapsing commodities prices , on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day raised $ 2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt-@@ sla@@ shing plan .
Lond@@ on-@@ listed Glen@@ core said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay down debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is gra@@ ppling with tu@@ mbling commodity prices as China '@@ s economic slowdown weigh@@ s on demand and spar@@ ks havoc across markets .
the rights issue sent Glen@@ core '@@ s share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day .
shares jumped 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ S@@ E 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core had last week revealed the $ 2.@@ 5-@@ billion shares sale as part of broader plans to sla@@ sh its $ 30 billion debt pile by about a third .
the company sold the new stock at 125 p@@ ence per share , which marked a 2.@@ 4-@@ percent discount to the closing price on Tu@@ es@@ day .
it off@@ loaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns over prolonged stalled Chinese growth have slashed iron ore prices by roughly a half , as coal , cop@@ per and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent .
white House confirms X@@ i Jin@@ ping '@@ s Washington visit
Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in a statement on Tu@@ es@@ day .
the visit , X@@ i '@@ s first official one to Washington , will take place on Sep@@ t . 25 and reciproc@@ ates President Barack Obama '@@ s trip to Beijing last November , the statement said .
the U.S. President and First L@@ ady Michelle Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife P@@ eng Li@@ yuan at a state dinner that evening , after the two leaders have engaged in bilateral talks .
`` President X@@ i '@@ s visit will present an opportunity to expand U.S@@ .@@ -@@ China cooperation on a range of global , regional , and bilateral issues of mutual interest , while also enabling President Obama and President X@@ i to address areas of disagreement construc@@ tively , '@@ ' the statement added .
X@@ i , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to stop in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington , before going on to New York City for the U@@ .@@ N@@ . General Assembly on Sep@@ t .
Obama and X@@ i are expected to bro@@ ach a range of contentious issues , including Washington '@@ s concerns over China '@@ s alleged cyber@@ e@@ spi@@ on@@ age and its increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea .
how the refugee crisis shattered the Schengen Z@@ one
the distress f@@ lare let off by Germany did n@@ '@@ t unite the European cre@@ w , but is now forcing the ship to change course , writes French daily Le F@@ ig@@ ar@@ o .
the European Union decided on M@@ ond@@ ay to deal with the refugee issue in advance : now it will systematically classi@@ fy migrants and asy@@ lu@@ m-@@ seekers as soon as they set foot on the old continent , especially in Greece , in order to prevent arguments about the future division of refugees according to quotas based on numbers that are ever-@@ further removed from reality .
six days after President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Jun@@ cker asked 25 of the 28 EU M@@ ember States to distribute 160 thousand refugees among themselves , the foreign ministers of M@@ ember States changed their priorities .
rather than worry about refugees ' final destination , it was now necessary to fil@@ ter those arri@@ ving now and resolve the fate of those who are already inside the Schengen Z@@ one .
`` The effective management of the EU '@@ s external borders is essential in order to manage migration , '@@ ' emphasi@@ sed the ministers in the text discussed in Brussels on M@@ ond@@ ay .
after the shared currency crisis the EU is now finding that its other major integration project is under threat .
while it may have been taken by surprise , Germany is not losing its resolve and is increasing the pressure .
it is rene@@ wing border controls , especially those with Austria , without blocking the entry of those seeking asylum in the country .
the central power in Europe is thus showing that no free movement is possible in Europe without it .
as evidence of this , Austria and Slovakia imposed the same measures on M@@ ond@@ ay .
Poland , the Netherlands , Belgium and even France are also considering them , albeit with varying levels of intensity .
Hungary imposed such measures long ago .
these exceptional , temporary measures are permitted by the rules of the Schengen Z@@ one .
however , even a blind man can see that this is a domin@@ o effect .
a key question for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece , southern Italy and Hungary for those who have already entered the interior .
intensive negotiations about this took place between French Minister of the Interior Bernard C@@ az@@ ene@@ u@@ ve and his German counterpart Thomas de Ma@@ i@@ zi@@ è@@ re during a private discussion with their colleagues from Greece , Italy and Hungary .
while this idea is not a new one , its real@@ is@@ ation is difficult .
according to uno@@ ff@@ ici@@ al statistics , two thirds of new@@ ly-@@ arrived refugees have already been registered and identified , including the taking of fin@@ ger@@ prints .
Budapest refuses to set up any entry point on its territory as it fears more than the others that it would have to deal with camps at which refugees would gather at its expense .
the real black hole in the matter remains Greece .
this year more than 200 thousand people have this year lan@@ ded on its islands along the Turkish coast , twice the number that have recently arrived in Italy .
the majority of these are genuine asylum seekers who have come directly from Syria after passing through the over@@ flowing camps in Lebanon , Turkey and Jordan .
it is an enormous , g@@ aping hole .
Athens , which is still enduring financial collapse , has taken a back seat .
it is the start@@ ing-@@ point for the Balkan route and a source of now joint concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian premier Viktor Or@@ bá@@ n .
Jun@@ cker '@@ s Commission promises to introduce control points as soon as possible , without stating a number or date .
`` The challenges facing Greece affect the whole of Europe , '@@ ' agreed the EU '@@ s interior ministers on M@@ ond@@ ay on the issue of mobili@@ sation in this regard .
the goal is to place intervention teams from the European border control agency Fron@@ te@@ x within the country .
the EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for the recei@@ pt of asy@@ lu@@ m-@@ seekers and reinforce surveillance of the islands .
`` appropriate funds will be required , '@@ ' war@@ ns the text submitted to ministers for approval .
from a legal point of view , Athens will continue to have the final say .
the issue of the creation of true European border controls was not officially raised , although Europe is heading towards them .
in any event , the new emergency faced by the twenty-@@ eight M@@ ember States has pushed the issue of mandatory quotas and the 160 thousand refugees , proposed by Jun@@ cker '@@ s Commission and the European Parliament at the start of the year and given strong support by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande , to the sidelines .
Hungary , Slovakia , the Czech Republic and Poland still refuse to enter@@ tain the idea
as they regard it as an attack on their sovereignty .
the number of refugees , but not the obligation to accept them , was retained in the text approved on M@@ ond@@ ay by the majority of M@@ ember States .
it was , however , retained as a political undertaking .
in other words , the process has been suspended .
the sole firm promise is for the redistribution of 40 thousand refugees within the next two years , which had already been agreed during the hec@@ tic EU summit in June , concludes Le F@@ ig@@ ar@@ o .
seven dead in av@@ al@@ anch@@ e in the Al@@ ps , inc@@ l@@ . three Czechs - reports .
three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an av@@ al@@ anch@@ e in the French Al@@ ps .
according to the authorities , the sole surviv@@ or from the eigh@@ t-@@ person group was a woman from Germany .
previous media reports had stated that she was Polish .
the woman , aged around thirty , was admitted to hospital in the town of Bri@@ anc@@ on with a serious injury to the th@@ igh@@ -@@ bone area .
according to A@@ F@@ P the dead were primarily in their for@@ ties .
`` The rescue mission has now ended and the bodies of the victims have been taken to Bri@@ anc@@ on for identification , '@@ ' stated Pier@@ re Bes@@ n@@ ard , pre@@ fec@@ t of the depar@@ tement H@@ au@@ tes-@@ Al@@ pes .
the accident occurred around no@@ on in the moun@@ tain@@ ous P@@ el@@ v@@ ou@@ x region below the peak of the 4,@@ 0@@ 15 me@@ tre@@ -high D@@ ô@@ me de N@@ ei@@ ge des E@@ c@@ r@@ ins .
`` The sudden av@@ al@@ anch@@ e was 250 me@@ tre@@ s wide and about a metr@@ e high , '@@ ' said the head of the rescue team , Nicolas Colom@@ ban@@ i .
the eigh@@ t-@@ person group was hit by a massive quantity of s@@ now at a height of about 3,@@ 900 me@@ tre@@ s , he continued .
the Me@@ te@@ oro@@ logical service today warned of un@@ fav@@ ou@@ rable weather conditions in the region .
T@@ r@@ pi@@ šov@@ ský ahead of Bra@@ ga game : finally the real Europe
on his European de@@ but , Liber@@ ec co@@ ach J@@ ind@@ ř@@ ich T@@ r@@ pi@@ šov@@ ský got through the Europ@@ a League quali@@ fying rounds to reach the group stages and is now looking forward to experiencing real European competition with the team .
in the first match in the main phase of the competition , Liber@@ ec host 2011 fin@@ alists Bra@@ ga , on whom they want to , according to the co@@ ach , impose their playing style .
after all the ner@@ ves in the kno@@ ck@@ -out games on your way to the group stages , where every goal and every situation could kno@@ ck you out , we '@@ re here now and we '@@ ll play six matches .
obviously we want to win , but we do n@@ '@@ t have to worry about every goal we concede , we can play to our tactics and we '@@ re not bound by a normal kno@@ ck@@ -out tie .
`` I '@@ m really looking forward to it and it '@@ s real European competition - before it was just quali@@ fication , '@@ ' said T@@ r@@ pi@@ šov@@ ský at the press conference .
he considers Bra@@ ga a top team .
they '@@ ll be very active and all their players are Brazilian , Portuguese or Spanish and good on the ball .
our opponents will probably be all the more difficult because they do n@@ '@@ t have any big names in their squ@@ ad , but they have a player who scored three goals against Manchest@@ er United I think .
`` They '@@ re an excellent team , one of the top teams , '@@ ' stated T@@ r@@ pi@@ šov@@ ský .
however , he does n@@ '@@ t consider Bra@@ ga the clear fav@@ ou@@ rit@@ e .
the way I see it , we '@@ re playing at home , so we '@@ re definitely not under@@ dogs .
`` I think that we '@@ ve showed , both in the league and in the quali@@ fying rounds , that we are strong at home , and we want to confirm that , '@@ ' said the co@@ ach , whose team has lost only the seas@@ on-@@ opening Sup@@ er@@ c@@ up against P@@ l@@ zeň out of its ele@@ ven games this season .
he believes that Liber@@ ec will be able to impose its playing style on Bra@@ ga , too .
we '@@ ll be playing a team that will be strong on the ball , while being at the same time , for them , almost at@@ yp@@ ically disciplined .
they play a 4-@@ 4-@@ 2 system with a rapid transition to attack .
`` They '@@ re very hard opponents . we did discover some weaknesses , but the most important thing will be what our players do on the pit@@ ch , '@@ ' said T@@ r@@ pi@@ šov@@ ský .
in the quali@@ fying rounds we studied our opponents a lot , which helped us a lot , and this time we want to focus on our game , to which we '@@ ve adapted our training .
`` And we definitely want the game to be played on our terms , even though it '@@ ll be very demanding , '@@ ' he added .

insurance companies to meet cli@@ ent claims in full if travel agencies go bankrupt .
insurance companies are to meet cli@@ ent claims to their full amount in the event of travel agencies going bankrupt@@ ,
following a decision taken on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day by the Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties , which has passed a modified amend@@ ment to the act on conditions for doing business in the tourism industry .
according to the document which now goes to the Senate for evaluation , travel agencies will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee .
insurance companies disagree with the obligation to meet cli@@ ent claims even above the agreed limit .
the Ministry for Regi@@ onal Development continues to insist upon the amend@@ ment , arguing in terms of consumer protection .
insurance companies have already threatened to stop insur@@ ing travel agencies if the amend@@ ment is passed .
however , the proposal is facing criticism from travel agencies , too@@ ,
as without insurance they will have to either close or go abroad .
Minister for Regi@@ onal Development Kar@@ la Kar@@ la Š@@ lech@@ tová -LRB- AN@@ O -RRB- pointed out that cases where insurance companies do not meet claims in full go against European law@@ ,
and highlighted this year '@@ s ruling by the Constitutional Court , which confirmed that clients are entitled to receive full re@@ funds irrespective of insurance limit .
Š@@ lech@@ tová emphasi@@ sed that insurance companies would receive sufficient information on the running of travel agencies and would be able to set the correct limit .
`` Wh@@ ile we appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection , it must have such a limit as to be feasible , '@@ ' countered top 0@@ 9 deputy chairman Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Kal@@ ou@@ sek .
Kal@@ ou@@ sek claims that bank guarantees wo n@@ '@@ t work as no-@@ one will give unlimited guarantees .
`` travel agencies will have to either close down or move abroad , '@@ ' he warned .
based on a survey of member travel agencies , member of the pre@@ si@@ di@@ um of the Association of travel agencies and Tour operators of the Czech Republic Tom@@ i@@ o O@@ kam@@ ura did not agree with Kal@@ ou@@ sek '@@ s fears .
`` St@@ op lobbying for the insurance companies , '@@ ' he said .
O@@ kam@@ ura does not consider the insurance companies ' statement to be relevant , and according to him , no such written , official statement to this effect exists .
they will , however , determine whether travel agencies will be able to make some contribution , which would not , according to O@@ kam@@ ura , be a problem .
also warning against the provision was Jana Fis@@ cher@@ ová -LRB- O@@ DS -RRB- , who highlighted the point of view of the competing Association of Czech travel agents , and her party colleague Pe@@ tr B@@ end@@ l , who talked of pulling the ru@@ g from under travel agencies ' feet .
according to Fis@@ cher@@ ová , travel agencies would not be able to negotiate insurance .
`` Con@@ sum@@ er protection works , '@@ ' judges Fis@@ cher@@ ová .
her proposal to dele@@ te the disputed passage was not passed by the Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties .
also unsuccessful was Voj@@ těch Fili@@ p -LRB- K@@ S@@ Č@@ M -RRB- , whose proposal to return the document to the committee stage due to an alleged conflict with the Civil C@@ ode did not pass , either .
Fili@@ p highlighted the tour operators , who he said could threaten the consumer .
following the ruling of the Constitutional Court , Mar@@ tina Ber@@ dy@@ chová -LRB- AN@@ O -RRB- , who tab@@ led the motion , withdrew her proposal , which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that premiums did not cover the entire risk .
the amend@@ ment will not contain the originally proposed minimum four-@@ million cro@@ wn insurance limit for travel agencies offering t@@ ours using air travel , or the m@@ illion-@@ cro@@ wn limit for agencies selling e.g. co@@ ach t@@ ours .
the limit will remain at 30 percent of planned tak@@ ings from the sale of t@@ ours .
however , the insurance limit will have to be such that travel agencies can cover the enti@@ re@@ ty of clients ' claims in the event of bankruptcy .
even after these modi@@ fications the law will require that tour operators now state which travel agency is organis@@ ing t@@ ours that have been sold .
before agreeing an insurance policy , travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies data on their economic management and number t@@ ours , among other data .
the approved amend@@ atory proposal by the public administration also anti@@ cip@@ ates the giving of further information to insurance companies .
every month travel agencies will have to submit data on the number of travel@@ lers and t@@ ours sold , the total price of t@@ ours sold and the amount of deposits and tak@@ ings from t@@ ours and vouch@@ ers .
should the Ministry of Regi@@ onal Development find that a travel agency has not met a legal obligation towards an insurance company , it will , according to the proposal , request that the agency remedy the situation or will be permitted to bar it from agreeing new contracts in the event that such a breach of its obligations could threaten the interests of customers .
the amend@@ ment is also to address the funding of the mountain rescue service .
the Ministry of Regi@@ onal Development will determine the level of subsidy provided to the mountain rescue service based on the service '@@ s application for the next year '@@ s funding , which is to be submitted by the end of April .
the application will contain a report on the use made of state funds in the previous year , a financial expenditure plan and the outlook over the next two years .
however , according to the association the sub@@ mit@@ ter did not take into account the situation that would arise if an insurance company termin@@ ated a contract with a travel agency .
the agency would then not be able to organi@@ se t@@ ours and clients who had bought t@@ ours prior to the termin@@ ation of the contract would , according to the Association , lose their t@@ ours .
in such a case , the travel agency would suffer a significant loss and may even go bust , even if its finances were in good condition .
one of the options for travel agencies to cope with such a situation would be to pursue claims for damages against the state .
another option would be to leave the Czech Republic and enjoy the much less stringent conditions abroad , while only operating in the Czech Republic as agencies , says Association deputy chairman Jan Pap@@ e@@ ž .
while the draft amend@@ ment also incor@@ po@@ rates bank guarantees , the idea is so badly thou@@ gh@@ t-@@ out that it would not be feasible in practice as bank guarantees can not be given for unlimited amounts .
furthermore , according to the Association a change in current practice is effectively super@@ flu@@ ous .
due to a new EU Direc@@ tive the law will have to be revised within a period of two years .
a total of 9@@ 42 active , insured travel agencies are currently active on the Czech market .
this year only three travel agencies closed down .
every year Czech travel agencies sell t@@ ours to a total value of twenty billion crow@@ ns .
Merkel : we must improve conditions in the Middle East
the European Union must promote the improvement of humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to reduce the number of refugees coming to Europe .
this was contained in a statement by Angela Merkel following discussions with German state premi@@ ers .
at the same time she again appealed for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among member states .
we must give more assistance to the countries from which refugees are coming or in which they stay when they leave their home country .
I expect a signal from the European Union that we promote dig@@ ni@@ fied conditions in refugee camps , for example in Jordan and Lebanon , said the German Chancellor , according to whom such a signal could be increased financial aid or closer cooperation between the EU and humanitarian organis@@ ations .
`` The German States also support the German government in promoting the fair distribution of the burden of the refugee crisis among the countries of Europe , '@@ ' stated Merkel .
in relation to this , Bran@@ den@@ burg prime minister Di@@ et@@ mar Wo@@ id@@ ke stated at the press conference that he expected true solidarity from all EU member states .
the Czech Republic , among others , is one of the countries that has , for some time now , rejected the quot@@ a-@@ based distribution of refugees .
Merkel and Wo@@ id@@ ke also spoke in fav@@ our of the acceleration of asylum proceedings in Germany .
people must know as soon as possible whether they have a chance to stay here .
this is also required by the authorities so that they can start with the integration of foreigners earlier , said the Bran@@ den@@ burg premier .
according to Wo@@ id@@ ke it is also necessary for the majority of money spent by Germany ion care for refugees to be put towards the integration of those who have a chance of gaining asylum .
more teachers will be required to teach refugees German .
it is a considerable challenge for my country , but I believe that , if we are successful in integrating refugees , then they can be an asset to us , he said .
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on down@@ plays diversity in fil@@ m@@ making
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on confronted African-American fil@@ m@@ maker E@@ ff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it was n@@ '@@ t needed behind the scenes .
during Sunday night '@@ s episode of H@@ B@@ O '@@ s Project Green@@ light , the seas@@ oned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative per@@ spec@@ tives regarding a black prot@@ ag@@ onist in the project '@@ s chosen scre@@ en@@ play .
`` When we '@@ re talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show , '@@ ' Dam@@ on asserted .
shocked , Brown reacted with off@@ ended dis@@ belief , letting out `` Ho@@ o ! W@@ ow . o@@ ka@@ y , '@@ ' as The Mar@@ ti@@ an actor '@@ s comments settled in the air .
Dam@@ on and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Aff@@ lec@@ k and the F@@ arre@@ l@@ ly brothers to discuss the show '@@ s fin@@ alists .
`` I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is , how they '@@ re going to treat the character of harmony , '@@ ' Brown initially said .
the only black character who '@@ s a ho@@ ok@@ er who gets hit by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the De@@ ar White People producer pushed for fin@@ alists Le@@ o Angel@@ os and K@@ rist@@ en Bran@@ c@@ ac@@ cio for the rights to direct the film ; Dam@@ on re@@ tor@@ ted their directing could `` end up giving us something we do n@@ '@@ t want . '@@ '
after the discussion ai@@ red , social media exploded in dis@@ approval over Dam@@ on '@@ s comments .
Twitter user M@@ r@@ Po@@ oni expressed anger toward the cli@@ p writing , `` Mat@@ t Dam@@ on speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is so white it hur@@ ts . '@@ '
the t@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4@@ ,000 likes since being post@@ ed .
Dam@@ on '@@ s comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves matter movement took nationwide effect , urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color .
in February , sing@@ er Prince al@@ lu@@ ded to the movement while introducing the nomin@@ e@@ es of al@@ bu@@ m of the Year at the Gra@@ m@@ my A@@ wards .
`` Al@@ bu@@ ms still matter , '@@ ' he said .
like books and black lives , al@@ bu@@ ms still matter .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Eli@@ sa@@ be@@ th Has@@ sel@@ bec@@ k '@@ s question of whether the group should be considered a hate group .
`` The Black Li@@ ves matter Net@@ work is a love group , '@@ ' leaders said .
Dam@@ on was recently announced as one of a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gul@@ s invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church '@@ s portra@@ yal in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear .
` American N@@ IN@@ J@@ A warri@@ or ' crow@@ ns first champion
Pro@@ -@@ rock clim@@ ber and bu@@ s@@ boy Isa@@ ac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athle@@ te to win American N@@ IN@@ J@@ A warri@@ or M@@ ond@@ ay night taking home the $ 1 million grand prize .
the competition show , which just w@@ rap@@ ped up its 7@@ th season , has never seen any competi@@ tor complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season fin@@ ale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and camer@@ am@@ an Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , made it to the final round .
the final task involved clim@@ bing a 7@@ 5-@@ foot rop@@ e in 30 secon@@ ds .
Brit@@ ten went first completing the challenge on time , making him the first-@@ ever athle@@ te to complete American N@@ IN@@ J@@ A warri@@ or '@@ s gru@@ eling stage 4 , however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished the challenge a full three secon@@ ds faster making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard-@@ fought victory , still in shock about winning the $ 1 million grand prize .
`` I mean it '@@ s amazing to think about , like I '@@ ve never made or lived off more than $ 10,000 a year , '@@ ' Isa@@ ac told E ! of his serious pa@@ y-@@ bu@@ mp .
so to all of a sudden ... like I ca n@@ '@@ t even imagine what it '@@ s going to be like ... the future is unknown .
executive producer K@@ ent weed sat down with The Hollywood repor@@ ter to discuss the fin@@ ale and why , despite Brit@@ ten being the first ever competi@@ tor to finish the course , wo n@@ '@@ t be awarded any prize money .
by the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
`` If there '@@ s more than one fin@@ i@@ sher , the one with the fastest time gets it , '@@ ' said weed .
as much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing , he does get the great gra@@ tification .
I do n@@ '@@ t think he harb@@ ors any ill will about it .
he '@@ s just so happy to have done what he '@@ s done .
he '@@ s received tons of ac@@ co@@ la@@ des from fans .
he '@@ s such a great gu@@ y , and a family man .
he '@@ s a hero to his kids and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , `` If I was going to be beat by someone , I '@@ m gla@@ d it '@@ s Isa@@ ac . '@@ '
and I think Isa@@ ac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed .
America N@@ IN@@ J@@ A warri@@ or was renewed for an eigh@@ th season , which will begin fil@@ ming in Spring 2016 .
Detro@@ it Tig@@ ers ti@@ p@@ to@@ e past Min@@ nes@@ ota twins
M@@ IN@@ NE@@ A@@ P@@ O@@ L@@ IS -- The second half the season has n@@ '@@ t been a lot of fun for the Detro@@ it Tig@@ ers .
once one of the best teams in ba@@ se@@ ball , the Tig@@ ers are now in last place in the American League Central .
reducing to being a spoil@@ er , the Tig@@ ers played the part perfectly Tu@@ es@@ day , beating the Min@@ nes@@ ota twins 5-@@ 4 at Target Fi@@ eld .
the twins squandered a chance to climb to within one-@@ half game of the Hou@@ ston A@@ stro@@ s for the second American League wil@@ d-@@ card spot .
for Detro@@ it , if only for one night , it was a return of the three-@@ letter F@@ -@@ word that has been so elusive over much of the season '@@ s second half .
`` All wins are fun , no matter how it happens , '@@ ' Tig@@ ers manager B@@ rad Aus@@ mus said .
ti@@ gers pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Sim@@ on made his early offensive support hold up , as Detro@@ it scored three times in the first two in@@ nings , then tac@@ ked one in the sixth and one more in the nin@@ th .
Sim@@ on -LRB- 13@@ -@@ 9 -RRB- pit@@ ched 6 1@@ /@@ 3 in@@ nings and allowed three runs .
it was only his third quality start in his past nine out@@ ings .
`` I just want to finish strong this year , '@@ ' Sim@@ on said .
it '@@ s hard for the bul@@ l@@ pen to throw every game , and that '@@ s why I want to go deep into the game .
ti@@ gers designated h@@ it@@ ter Victor Mar@@ tin@@ ez had three hits and drove in two runs , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid-@@ August .
it was Mar@@ tin@@ ez '@@ s first three-@@ hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mar@@ in@@ ers on July 6 .
`` He sw@@ ung the b@@ at well , '@@ ' Aus@@ mus said .
he looked good in -LRB- bat@@ ting practice -RRB- , looked notic@@ e@@ ably better in BP , and he carried it right into the game .
tra@@ iling by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning , the twins had their best chance to get back into the game .
center fi@@ el@@ der B@@ y@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton led off the inning with a double down the left field line .
right fi@@ el@@ der A@@ ar@@ on H@@ icks reached on a bun@@ t single , and Sim@@ on got second bas@@ eman Bri@@ an Do@@ zi@@ er to strike out sw@@ inging before being lifted for left-@@ hand@@ er Bla@@ ine har@@ dy .
har@@ dy wal@@ ked Mau@@ er , the only man he faced , ahead of ro@@ ok@@ ie designated h@@ it@@ ter Mi@@ gu@@ el S@@ ano , who ri@@ pped a two-@@ run single to left off right-@@ hand@@ er drew Ver@@ H@@ ag@@ en .
with a pa@@ ir of run@@ ners on and the ty@@ ing run at second , Ver@@ H@@ ag@@ en got third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor P@@ lou@@ ff@@ e to ground into a double play .
it was the maj@@ or-@@ le@@ agu@@ e-@@ leading 27@@ th time this season that P@@ lou@@ ff@@ e hit into a DP .
after Detro@@ it tac@@ ked on an insurance run in the top of the nin@@ th , Mau@@ er ri@@ pped an R@@ BI double to the gap against Tig@@ ers closer Bru@@ ce R@@ ond@@ on to make it 5-@@ 4 .
however , the right-@@ hand@@ er struck out S@@ ano on three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detro@@ it took advantage of a ru@@ sty Ph@@ il Hu@@ gh@@ es in the early going .
the Tig@@ ers post@@ ed three runs in the first two in@@ nings against the veter@@ an right-@@ hand@@ er , who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back infla@@ m@@ mation .
`` Ob@@ vi@@ ously not the start I '@@ d like to have , '@@ ' Hu@@ gh@@ es said , `` but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . '@@ '
after getting the lead@@ off bat@@ ter in the first , Hu@@ shes gave up a single to second bas@@ eman I@@ an K@@ ins@@ ler .
a two-@@ out walk to right fi@@ el@@ der J@@ .@@ D. Mar@@ tin@@ ez brought up Victor Mar@@ tin@@ ez , who sing@@ led up the middle for the first run of the game .
vic@@ tor Mar@@ tin@@ ez sna@@ pped his 0-@@ for-@@ 21 stre@@ ak with run@@ ners in scor@@ ing position .
third bas@@ eman N@@ ick Cast@@ el@@ lan@@ os followed with a single to right , scor@@ ing another run , but Victor Mar@@ tin@@ ez was thrown out trying to advance to third , ending the threat .
the Tig@@ ers added on in the second , getting a one-@@ out double from cat@@ cher James Mc@@ Can@@ n and a two-@@ out single by center fi@@ el@@ der An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ose to make it 3-@@ 0 .
`` That was a big hit , '@@ ' twins manager Paul M@@ oli@@ tor said .
he did n@@ '@@ t hit it particularly well , but he got it in the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es , who was on a pit@@ ch count , pit@@ ched a sco@@ re@@ less third inning before being replaced by right-@@ handed reli@@ ever A@@ .@@ J@@ . A@@ ch@@ ter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : ti@@ gers R@@ H@@ P Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder .
he will be examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who performed surgery on San@@ che@@ z '@@ s shoulder back in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-@@ August , was scheduled to be activ@@ ated for a W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day start .
with San@@ che@@ z out , L@@ H@@ P Daniel Nor@@ ris will come off the D@@ L to start against the twins .
Nor@@ ris is 1-@@ 1 in four starts with the Tig@@ ers since being acquired in a trade for L@@ H@@ P David Pr@@ ice on July 30 .
he has been out since Au@@ g@@ . 20 with a strained right obli@@ que .
the Tig@@ ers and twins will wra@@ p up their three-@@ game series at Target Fi@@ eld on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day .
Nor@@ ris -LRB- 2-@@ 2 , 4.@@ 43 era -RRB- will oppose Min@@ nes@@ ota R@@ H@@ P Er@@ vin S@@ ant@@ ana -LRB- 5-@@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 era -RRB- .
X@@ i ur@@ ges to open economy wider to world
the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping told a group ta@@ sk@@ ed with steering reform on Tu@@ es@@ day .
`` China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise , and improve open@@ ing-@@ up policies , '@@ ' he said , addressing the 16th Me@@ eting of the Central Le@@ ading Group for De@@ e@@ pen@@ ing overall Reform .
promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality , and provide new room for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access , rela@@ x@@ ation of b@@ ord@@ er-@@ control policies , encouraging state-owned enterprises -LRB- SO@@ E -RRB- to absorb private capital and overha@@ uling the re@@ sident regist@@ ration system .
according to the statement , a negative list , identifying sectors and businesses that are off-@@ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
the system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs .
the move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources , ensuring a law@@ -based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also loos@@ en controls on the powers it deleg@@ ates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
the statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in a bid to open up state-controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
`` The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the lawful interests of foreign-@@ funded companies and provide better services for them , '@@ ' said the statement .
in addition , it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits , or `` green card , '@@ ' by opti@@ mi@@ zing requirements and stre@@ am@@ lining the application process .
guaranteeing lawyers ' right to practice and nur@@ turing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting was also attended by Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang , and senior leaders Liu Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ ol@@ i , according to a statement released after the meeting .
more hospital b@@ eds possible in Kar@@ lovy vary Regi@@ on
according to deputy governor of the Kar@@ lovy vary Regi@@ on J@@ aku@@ b P@@ áni@@ k -LRB- Č@@ SS@@ D -RRB- , the current bed capacity of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial modi@@ fications should be implemented on the basis of agreements between the departments of individual hospitals .
however , in the region there are options for expanding the care offered .
for example , single-@@ day surgery cent@@ res for the performance of procedures not requiring hospital stays of longer than 24 hours could be set up in surgical units .
it is not yet clear in which specific hospitals single-@@ day surgery cent@@ res could be set up .
the skin department of Kar@@ lovy vary Ho@@ sp@@ ital could see the creation of a la@@ ser Cent@@ re with the option of using la@@ ser technology to treat skin disease .
the concept also recommended the set@@ up of an ap@@ al@@ lic Cent@@ re for the treatment of patients with brain disease who are in a ve@@ ge@@ tative state .
such a Cent@@ re would be centr@@ ally managed and should form an integral part of the Ana@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ ology and Re@@ susc@@ itation department .
there is also the option of concentrating such a facility at O@@ stro@@ v Ho@@ sp@@ ital , where a similar facility already exists .
a further area where capacity seems insufficient are the after@@ -@@ care wards , and chiefly the long-term C@@ are clinics -LRB- L@@ CC -RRB- in Nej@@ dek , whose capacity is insufficient and should primarily connect with acute care wards .
the concept recommen@@ ds that part of this facility function as a rehabilitation ward and part as a classic L@@ CC ward .
as it notes , after@@ -@@ care wards are chiefly absent in Kar@@ lovy vary Ho@@ sp@@ ital@@ ,
where buildings left empty following centr@@ alisation could be used .
last but not least , the Kar@@ lovy vary Regi@@ on lacks social care wards focusing on the treatment of Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er '@@ s disease .
as there is a lack of such wards across the whole country , it could also serve other regions as an ` Al@@ z@@ he@@ im@@ er Cent@@ re ' .
according to the recommendations , hospitals should prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up wards that would be funded through European subsidies .
`` The@@ se are b@@ eds that would follow on from super-@@ speci@@ al@@ ised medical care fields and create space for the transfer of patients following , for example , a car@@ di@@ ological , neuro@@ logical , transplan@@ tation or other procedure , '@@ ' states the regional concept for care wards .
new services could also be offered in psychiatric care .
