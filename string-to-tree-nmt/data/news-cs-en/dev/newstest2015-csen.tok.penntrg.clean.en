Petr Čech : Transfer at the last minute ?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day when it is still possible to jump through the transfer window and make a major change .
The next chance wo n&apos;t come until winter .
Petr Čech is currently a substitute goalkeeper for Chelsea , but now he does not await a new professional contract in Madrid , Monaco or even Paris .
He is sitting at the NH Hotel in Prague , talking to Czech reporters , and he is planning to participate with the Czech team in a rehearsal match with the Americans , after which he will also start the process of qualification for Euro 2016 against the Netherlands .
Chelsea will give priority in the new season of the Premier League to Thibaut Courtois in the goal , and Čech for the first time in ten years in the London team has ended up in the position of substitute .
Some time ago , it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in Čech .
At the start of the season , he lost the Spanish Super Cup in competition with Athletics and did not even manage to enter the league season , when he lost 2 : 4 in San Sebastian .
Interest from Paris SG was also speculated about .
It started the French League season with two wins and two draws , and on Sunday it defeated St. Etienne 5 : 0 .
It is putting the most pressure on AS Monaco .
It so far has a balance of 1-1-2 in the league , and over the weekend it parted with Lille with a 1 : 1 tie .
Today news appeared on tabloid English-language websites stating that the Queens Park Rangers may want Čech .
However , according to English bookmakers , Čech &apos;s departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely .
Skybet assigned him odds of 4 : 1 .
Petr , is it possible that during the remaining few hours you will change your uniform ?
I do n&apos;t anticipate it , but in soccer nothing is ever 100 % .
For example , during the day an offer can arrive that ca n&apos;t be refused .
How would such an offer have to look ?
-LRB- laughs -RRB- `` Well , I do n&apos;t know yet , how the kind of offer that ca n&apos;t be refused basically looks .
There would have to be a consensus among all parties , and mainly would depend on Chelsea &apos;s position as to whether or not to examine the offer .
Is it even technically possible to make such a transfer when you &apos;re in Prague now ?
Would n&apos;t it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in a new location ?
Well , I have n&apos;t considered that .
But in such a situation , there are a lot of players today , and all of them are somewhere in representation matches , and certainly today a lot of transfers will be finalized .
So it could be somewhat achievable .
How many clubs are there in the world that could afford you ?
Well , I really do n&apos;t know .
And are you not pushing for departure ?
The situation when I have not ended up anywhere as a goalkeeper in the first three games of the new season is new for my fifteen-year career .
Nonetheless , there is no need to panic , pack up and go somewhere .
I want to stay in the competition for the position of Chelsea goalkeeper , and it &apos;s up to the coach who gets selected and what decisions he will make in the weeks to come .
What role has your family played in your decisions ?
I take all factors into consideration .
Sports prospects are understandably important for me , but I also look at everything from a personal point of view , which of course includes consideration for the family &apos;s needs .
Is it possible that you could play as a goalkeeper for different team in England ?
That &apos;s a question that I though would never apply to me .
But in soccer everything is possible .
I do n&apos;t want to rule out anything .
I do n&apos;t know the answer .

George Webster , 28 , faced the charges during a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow .
He is alleged to have raped a woman at the Scotland &apos;s Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7 , 2013 .
It is claimed Webster attacked her while she was `` unconscious , asleep and incapable of giving consent . &apos;&apos;
Webster is then charged with raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn in the Highlands on May 4 , 2014 .
Judge Lady Rae set a trial date for November 17 at the High Court in Edinburgh .
Reconnecting With the Very American Ideal That Labor Rights Are Human Rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right .
`` As go unions , so go middle-class jobs , &apos;&apos; says Ellison , the Minnesota Democrat who serves as a Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act with civil rights icon John Lewis .
This ground-breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-union forces in their tracks
Amending the National Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for engaging in union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compensatory and punitive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative .
But it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards .
Indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and the cosponsors of their legislation are proposing is as a reconnection with a very American idea .
Despite the battering that unions have taken in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embrace , extend and respect labor rights .
There was a time , within the living memory of millions of Americans , when this country championed democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same breath .
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Douglas MacArthur and his aides encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that Hideki Tojo &apos;s militarized autocracy would be replaced with democracy .
Fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan , they included language that explicitly recognized that `` the right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed . &apos;&apos;
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Adolf Hitler &apos;s fascism was replaced with muscular democracy .
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and make their voices heard in the new nation , the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared : `` The right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profession .
Agreements that restrict or seek to impair this right shall be null and void ; measures directed to this end shall be unlawful .
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights , which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global covenant , Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests . &apos;&apos;
For generations , Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights .
When this country counseled other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies , Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected .
Now , with those rights under assault in America , it is wise , indeed , to recommit to the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society .
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago :
History is a great teacher .
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not diminish the strength of the nation but enlarged it .
By raising the living standards of millions , labor miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to undreamed of levels of production .
Those who attack labor forget these simple truths , but history remembers them .
History remembers , as should we .
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing ideals that have historically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy .
Judge temporarily blocks law that could close all Louisiana abortion clinics
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Louisiana law that advocates say would likely have closed all five abortion clinics in the state .
The measure , signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and due to take effect Sept . 1 , would require doctors who perform abortions to have patient admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice .
However , the judge &apos;s ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while seeking such privileges .
`` Plaintiffs will be allowed to operate lawfully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges , &apos;&apos; Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in the decision .
A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law .
Abortion rights activists applauded the decision , the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures , saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges .
`` Today &apos;s ruling ensures Louisiana women are safe from an underhanded law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights , &apos;&apos; said Nancy Northup , president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights , which sued to block the law on behalf of three of the state &apos;s five clinics .
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the suit and have also applied for admitting privileges .
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws , with courts recently ruling unconstitutional such measures in Alabama and Mississippi .
Key parts of a Texas law that would have shuttered most remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday .
Abortion rights campaigners , along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association , say admitting privileges laws impose medically unnecessary requirements on doctors .
Anti-abortion advocates have countered that the measures aim to protect women &apos;s health , though some have also lauded their effect of shuttering clinics .
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admitting privileges , the Center for Reproductive Rights said .
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions , that doctor , fearful for his safety , would stop carrying out the procedure , the group said .
In arguing against the ruling , Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors performing abortions while their applications for admitting privileges were pending .
Delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment mean ovarian cancer kills more in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their late mother who died of Ovarian cancer in 2007 .
Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their city counterparts .
Researchers analysed medical records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 , finding just 35 per cent lived for five years after diagnosis .
Lead researcher Susan Jordan , of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute , said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
SMALL STUDY : New drugs may slow lung , ovarian cancer
The researchers tracked the women &apos;s medical journeys across seven years .
Dr Jordan said a woman &apos;s age at the time of diagnosis , ovarian cancer type , having existing illnesses and socio-economic status also impacted on survival chances .
Older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the poorest survival rates .
Those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer , Dr Jordan suggested delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors .
`` This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncology surgeons and they &apos;re mostly based in major cities , &apos;&apos; she said .
Despite improving tele-medicine services to lessen the tyranny of distance , she suggested more fly-in , fly-out services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people in treatment away from their communities could help .
Dr Jordan said regardless of geographical status , the study found long-term survival among women with ovarian cancer was poor , reinforcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
The research , funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer , will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
In March 2012 , at 33 years of age , young Gold Coast mum Elisha Neave was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
Garden centres rue fall in homeowners
The drop , coupled with a particular decline in the number of homeowners aged under 35 , could result in garden centres losing out on tens of millions of pounds a year when today &apos;s young consumers reach the `` core gardening age group , &apos;&apos; according to the HTA &apos;s study , which was reported by the Financial Times .
According to the report , people renting properties spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that those with their own homes spend on their gardens .
It cited the rise in people living in highly urbanised areas with no gardens , the popularity of paving over front gardens for parking and shrinking garden size as other factors threatening the industry , which is worth an estimated £ 5 billion in sales each year .
Greater London , where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years , has Britain &apos;s lowest spend per household on gardening products .
The HTA and Royal Horticultural Society said that renting property or a lack of garden space did not mean people could not grow plants .
Guy Barter , chief horticultural adviser to the RHS , said : `` Container gardening , for example , is especially popular with renters who can move their plants when they relocate . &apos;&apos;
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the garden retail sector &apos;s ` golden age &apos;&apos; as a result of increased home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to mid-1990s .
It also predicted an improved market this year due to better weather following unfavourable conditions in March and April last year .
When an Eastern dictator preaches about democracy .
At a meeting of his youth organization , which must resembles Hitler Youth , rattled his sabers by pointing out that Russia has nuclear weapons and basically made clear to everyone that he does n&apos;t care about their opinions , today he gave us a lecture about democracy .
However , I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia has many characteristics of a Fascist state .
Large countries have one thing in common , and that is that they can both take advantage of passionate nationalism and transform an inferiority complex into imperialist appetites .
Time apparently passes differently in the East than in the West .
While the Western world has been believing that the era of wars and dominance over Europe is over , in the East they think on the contrary that they have been overlooked for too long already and that it is necessary to regain their international position .
Such moods and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s , shortly before the Nazis took power , and that was followed by an eruption of nationalism not unlike today &apos;s situation in Russia .
The absolutely identical cult of a powerful leader , beating of journalists , liquidation of political opponents and discrimination against gays and other minorities are all very close to that mindset .
Vladimir Putin and certainly many Russians apparently miss the time when Russia ruled half of the world and the other half feared it .
Western politicians must have caused it themselves , maybe by not patting Vladimir on the shoulders enough , maybe by not inviting him to where he wanted to go and maybe by starting to underestimate him , after which he just behaved like a typical Russian strongman .
He established order at home , he acted like he did n&apos;t even want to go anywhere , and he sharpened his knives at home .
Now he has decided that he wants to regain his country &apos;s lost position .
He &apos;ll start gradually , because he has time .
He &apos;ll probably be leader for life , so why hurry ?
He stepped on the Caucasus , now he &apos;s stepping on Ukraine , and the dwarfs from the Baltics are probably next .
They have been a thorn in the eye of the Russian bear for a long time already .
This certainly will also be noticed by China , who has been making a lot of waves and has its eye on the Far East .
And the Germans too are really upsetting Vladimir with how well they are doing , and we really kicked their asses in 1945 .
How about establishing a Novorossiya in Karlovy Vary ?
That could be a small base , and there are plenty of compatriots there , and they are so oppressed there , and some locals already have wanted to demolish some of their houses .
After all , our veterans still remember how well they had it in Czechoslovakia .
And their prime minister , Gospodin Sobotka , he so soft that he can be peeled like an onion , and with him their entire EU too .
That &apos;s how it would play out , so that great Russia could re-emerge .
They need to be reminded where their place is .
And we can use our countrymen who live on their territory as weapons .
There are plenty of Russians everywhere , and when it is said that they are oppressed , then they are simply oppressed , and we will not leave it like that , but we will protect them .
And then the Russians will be in control again , because what else are they born for after all ?
After all , Europe is merely a stepping stone , on which proud Ivan can do a Cossack dance .
Turkey Summons US Diplomat Over Spying Report
The Turkish foreign ministry has summoned the most senior U.S. diplomat in the country for clarification of a report about American and British spying in Turkey .
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d&apos;affaires and Turkish officials had discussed the report Monday .
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept said that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a high priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services .
According to Turkish news wires , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report , saying that all major countries spied on each other .
An earlier report that Germany &apos;s main intelligence agency had also targeted Ankara drew a more angry response from the Turkish government .
The serial `` Game of Thrones &apos;&apos; presents more tricks in the fourth series
The creators of `` Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth series of the iconic serial .
So far , they can boast of how the tricks of the fourth series were created .
The most visible features are computer modifications of the serial &apos;s environment and mass scenes , when the giant Daenerys army emerges from a crowd of soldiers .
Magaluf police chief charged over corruption
The claimants presented proof of extortion by policemen and Calvià Town Hall civil servants at Mallorca &apos;s public prosecutor &apos;s office on Friday .
The head of Calvià police on the holiday island of Majorca has been arrested following corruption claims filed by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot of Magaluf .
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been remanded in custody following corruption claims made against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena , the street where most of Magaluf &apos;s bars and nightclubs are located .
According to online daily Mallorca Diario , the claimants presented proof of extortion by policemen and Calvià Town Hall civil servants at the office of Majorca &apos;s anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday .
Two other local police officers were arrested by Spanish Civil Guards in connection to the corruption claims and will have to be questioned by a judge alongside Navarro .
Spanish national daily ABC reported the disgruntled nightclub owners as saying favouritism by authorities was having a serious effect on their businesses .
`` It &apos;s not about making money anymore , it &apos;s about surviving , &apos;&apos; one of the businessmen told the court .
You do n&apos;t mess with our livelihoods .
We have nothing to lose .
Magaluf made international headlines this summer as a result of a viral YouTube video which showed an 18-year-old British holidaymaker performing fellatio on 24 men during a pub crawl .
Island authorities have since attempted to clamp down on the drunk and disorderly behaviour of Magaluf holiday revellers by minimizing numbers on the notorious alcohol-fuelled bar crawls .
In addition , the Playhouse club where the fellatio incident took place was forced to shut down for a year , while Playhouse and the bar crawl organizers Carnage were jointly fined € 55,000 -LRB- $ 73,000 -RRB- .
The tourist resort of Magaluf , mainly popular with young British holidaymakers , has also seen numerous alcohol-fuelled accidents involving the craze known as `` balconing , &apos;&apos; where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool .
First day of spring marked with wet and blustery conditions impacting Adelaide Airport flights
SPRING has sprung a wintry surprise on southern South Australia , bringing heavy showers and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport .
A further 5mm of rain fell on the city in the evening up to 9pm , following the 6.6mm that fell overnight on Sunday .
The latest rain came courtesy of a couple of short , blustery showers , including a burst that started just before 8pm that dumped almost 4mm in about 10 minutes .
After winter delivered an early dose of spring last week , temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city .
The squally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide .
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7.30pm but was hit by windshear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out .
Wind gusts were reaching about 50km @/@ h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time .
Flight data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.40pm .
That flight &apos;s delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights , including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney .
A top of 16C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday , with the chance of a shower or two .
Israeli Children Return to School After Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars rained on their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war , while schools in Gaza remained shuttered as the territory recovered from the fighting .
The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to rocket-scarred communities in southern Israel , but the signs of the fighting remained fresh .
In the southern city of Ashdod , employees at the `` Pashosh &apos;&apos; kindergarten , which was struck by a rocket , removed shrapnel marks off the walls and slides ahead of the students &apos; arrival .
`` We are a little scared but we are excited , &apos;&apos; said Ronit Bart , a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher in its school .
A lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine .
Her 11-year-old daughter , Shani Bart , said it felt a `` little bit weird &apos;&apos; to suddenly be going back to school .
`` There were some difficult times and we did n&apos;t leave our houses at all , &apos;&apos; she said .
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz , which is located close to the Gaza border , to offer his support .
Until a cease-fire halted the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire .
Many residents of Nahal Oz , a community close to the Gaza frontier where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell , are hesitant about coming back .
The Education Ministry said about a dozen families still had not returned .
Their children have been placed in alternate schools for the time being .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot , a Gaza border town that has been hard hit by Palestinian fire .
He urged the children to study hard and said `` we will make sure to provide you with knowledge and provide you with security . &apos;&apos;
Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce last Tuesday .
The cease-fire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues unresolved , such as Hamas &apos; demand for the lifting of an Israel-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza &apos;s air and seaports .
Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war .
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt .
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians , three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children , according to Palestinian and U.N. estimates .
Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants , though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims .
On the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting , mostly in the south .
The Israeli military , meanwhile , carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks .
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza , and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters .
With tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging , education officials delayed the start of the school year last week .
`` I hope the school will open soon to complete our education , just like the world &apos;s children and Jewish children , &apos;&apos; said Mohammad Amara , a 13-year-old boy staying in a Gaza City school .
Vrba at event : I &apos;m behind Váchou .
And Lafata has a fever
Today before noon , the Czech soccer team met in Prague ahead of the Wednesday preparatory match with the United States and the subsequent initial match of the qualification for the European Championship in the Netherlands .
One of the team &apos;s 23 members , Sparta &apos;s offensive player David Lafata , has a fever .
David is not here yet , but last week Sparta had some problems , which involved multiple players , and David apparently still has some of those problems .
But we want him to be here and for him to be feeling better as soon as possible , &apos;&apos; coach Pavel Vrba told reporters .
`` Whether it will be two or three days or he will be fit tomorrow will depend on his health condition , about which our doctor will decide .
The other players are fine .
`` Of course , someone has some pain from time to time , but it &apos;s not so bad that they can not practice or participate in the match with the United States on Wednesday , &apos;&apos; the Czech coach said .
On Sunday evening , Vrba called up Sparta reserve player Lukáše Váchu last .
He has admitted that it was not an easy decision , and other mid-fielders were considered .
`` I made my decision based on the fact that Lukáš is a perspective player who is 25 years old .
The decision was very difficult , but I stand behind it , &apos;&apos; Vrba said regarding Váchu .
And what about Šural ?
Time will tell what will happen with Lafata .
The possibility that the nomination could still be changed if there are health problems can not be ruled out .
Over the weekend , Liberec &apos;s Josef Šural , for example , performed excellently when he did a hat trick .
Of course , they are players who have been demonstrating their talent recently .
Time will tell how David Lafata will feel .
If he will not be available on Wednesday , then I do n&apos;t claim that I can not nominate another player who has performed well in the Czech league to replace him , &apos;&apos; Vrba said .
This afternoon , the Czech team will face training in Strahov , and on Tuesday it will face traditional pre-match training before the duel with the United States at Letné , which will be open for fans and will be followed by autograph signing .
The match with the Americans will start on Wednesday at 8 : 15 p.m. , and in it the national team hopes to achieve a premier victory under Vrba &apos;s coaching .
In the last three preparatory matches , there were two draws , and it lost one game .
The qualification match with the Netherlands will start at 8 : 45 p.m. on 9 September .
Pešice to represent the Netherlands in Italy
Vrba is glad that unlike during previous matches he has more time for training .
`` It &apos;s an advantage , when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them , which we did n&apos;t have as much time for before .
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing as best as possible for the Netherlands , &apos;&apos; Vrba explained .
Before the game in Prague , the Dutch team will play in Italy on Thursday , and the match will be watched personally by temporary team coach Josef Pešice .
He will give us information from the match as it becomes available .
But it wo n&apos;t be only about him . We will also have the game filmed , and we will analyze it .
There is a new trainer coming to the Netherlands , so we will see what kinds of changes there will be , &apos;&apos; Vrba said , referring to the bronze medalists from the recent World Championship .
Housing prices have posted their strongest winter gain in seven years , according to a widely-watched gauge .
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home value index of Australian capital city dwelling prices rose by 1.1 per cent in August , RP data said on Monday .
The rise brought the total gain over the June , July and August to 4.2 per cent , the biggest rise over the winter months since 2007 .
Annual growth in prices came in at 10.9 per cent , more than double the gain of the 12 months to August 2013 , but the gains were not evenly spread across the country .
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two tier market .
The RP Data figures show Sydney home prices rose by 16.1 per cent in the past year , while Melbourne &apos;s were up by 11.7 per cent .
The next strongest markets were Adelaide , Brisbane and Darwin , with price rises averaging between five and six per cent .
At the other end of the scale was Canberra , hit by government spending cutbacks , where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent through the year .
Mr Lawless said that now spring has begun there would be a rise in listings of properties for sale over the coming few months , which would be a `` real test &apos;&apos; for the market .
`` Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates , a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment , it &apos;s likely that dwelling values will rise even further over the next three months , &apos;&apos; he said .
Lenny Henry : My father never hugged me .
Never said `` I love you &apos;&apos;
Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
His father , who died when Henry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry is rehearsing a comedy , Rudy &apos;s Rare Records , which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series .
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the tunes are upbeat .
But Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood .
There was `` a lot &apos;&apos; of therapy after his mother died and Henry is reflective about his relationship with his father .
He was very unknowable .
You never saw his face , you just heard his voice : ` Stop the noise .
Leave your sister alone .
Move !
I want to watch the cricket .
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown-up when I was a kid - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass , the beauty of the stroke in cricket .
I never had a conversation with him like that .
He was this unsmiling bloke in the corner , reading the paper for a lot of my life .
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and , although conditions were better than in his father &apos;s day , he got a snapshot of what life must have been like for him .
It &apos;s a bit brighter now but they &apos;re dark , smoky , Stygian labyrinthine depths with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot .
My dad used to get in the bath and just lie there and you &apos;d hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would wash the foundry off him .
When I walked round it , I realised that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table , and my estimation of him went up .
None the less , Henry emerged from a childhood stripped of parental affection .
My dad never did hugging , never said , ` I love you &apos; .
It was n&apos;t until my mum was poorly near the end of her life that we started saying ` I love you , I love you , I love you .
Having a daughter of his own , Billie , with Dawn French , enabled him to share the love he missed as a child .
Could you stop with the `` I love you &apos;&apos; ?
Just stop hugging me !
Dad , I &apos;m 22 !
With Dawn French .
Why would n&apos;t I be friends with her ?
She &apos;s a great mum
He &apos;s still very good friends with French , to whom he was married for 25 years .
Dawn &apos;s a good person .
Why would n&apos;t I be friends with Dawn ?
She &apos;s a great mum .
Henry &apos;s own mother was diabetic .
It was one of the things that killed her .
So when I became very , very overweight and started getting diabetic symptoms , my doctor said , ` You &apos;ve got to be radical .
So I went on a big fitness thing , and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
It &apos;s very hard .
And it &apos;s tedious .
Nobody likes eating carrots .
Henry &apos;s change in career trajectory is , perhaps , reflected in his distinguished , close-cropped beard .
Since he won critical acclaim for his Othello , he has become engrossed in the theatre .
Comedy of Errors followed , as did Fences by August Wilson .
It &apos;s a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have upholstered his busy working life .
He started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory .
A DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and wrote to New Faces about him .
His TV career was launched in the mid-Seventies : `` For quite a long time I was the only black impressionist @/@ comedian on telly . &apos;&apos;
He learnt on the job .
Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye , I had to learn how to be an efficient joke-delivering mechanism between 1975 and 1985 , whilst being a star , being on television and it was really difficult .
Lenny on New Faces in 1975
Because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show , a light entertainment programme in which people `` blacked up , &apos;&apos; Henry found himself performing his comedy in it for five years .
My family were very uncomfortable about it .
I sort of wish it had never happened , but I do n&apos;t regret that I did it .
Although it was a weird , reprehensible position to be in , I was working in huge venues and learning how to work a crowd .
But what was an `` award-winning light entertainment staple of British television for years and years &apos;&apos; was also a `` grotesque parody of black people . &apos;&apos;
Introducing characters who both lampooned and celebrated black British culture , Henry worked on the alternative comedy circuit in the Eighties .
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984 , and in the Nineties he was known as , among other things , chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef ! .
Advertisements , documentaries , TV series and parts in films consumed his next decade but after his 2008 BBC series , LennyHenry.tv , he thought : `` What are you going to do next , Len , because it all feels a bit like you &apos;re marking time or you &apos;re slightly going sideways . &apos;&apos;
What came next was a Radio 4 documentary series called What &apos;s So Great About ... ?
The first was on Shakespeare .
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare .
I was n&apos;t really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of middle-class white people with tights and a cabbage down the front .
So I was very frightened of it .
Everybody we interviewed on that show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench , said , ` You should try it .
Do n&apos;t slag it off if you do n&apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
Get some of the words in your mouth and then you &apos;ll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much .
Henry delivered 20 lines of Othello &apos;s last speech for the documentary and he was hooked .
It gave me the feeling that I could do it .
It &apos;s almost like I had my head put on straight for me .
` This is what it &apos;s about , it &apos;s a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your lines , do some research .
So the rehearsal process was brutal and I was reading that play for months and months before we did it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car crash and it did n&apos;t quite happen .
Soon he was starring in Comedy of Errors .
Suddenly I &apos;m at the National Theatre and I just could n&apos;t quite believe it .
There was one moment where I thought , ` Oh , you &apos;ve changed . &apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;
There was a technical fault and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to keep the audience entertained .
`` A little voice inside me said , ` You &apos;re going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer . &apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;
Instead , the stage manager announced the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved .
I walked off the stage and something in me went , `` Oh , thank God . &apos;&apos;
It &apos;s not my responsibility .
I can let somebody else sort it out .
` You &apos;re in a play , stay in character . &apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;
Henry appearing in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning his lines for Fences was challenging .
Panic &apos;s quite good , it stiffens the sinews .
That was well received too , so it &apos;s like a big sign from the gods , saying , ` This is what you should be doing . &apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;
He says this , of course , in a BOOMING voice .
So I &apos;m sticking with it .
I &apos;m really loving it .
I love being in a rehearsal room .
Henry still has a comedian &apos;s brain , though - throughout , our conversation is broken with flashes of his humour as he slips in and out of impressions .
I &apos;m just choosing not to do stand-up because that thing of getting instant gratification from a room full of strangers I guess is kind of dangerous .
If you &apos;re constantly seeking that it can lead to a brick wall .
I do Live at the Apollo sometimes when I want to , but generally it does n&apos;t float my boat like it used to .
I ask whether he &apos;ll ever do another stand-up tour .
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning , middle and end of a journey - I do n&apos;t think I &apos;ll ever want to give that up .
So this is his new incarnation ?
I think so .
I like being an actor .
It &apos;s good fun .
You &apos;re always telling a story and that &apos;s a great place to be .
I love stories .
People love stories .
Kenya registers civil servants to target ` ghost workers &apos;
Kenya has started biometrically registering all civil servants in an attempt to remove `` ghost workers &apos;&apos; from the government &apos;s payroll .
Employees who failed to register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid , a government statement said .
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service .
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to curb corruption in the public service after taking office in 2013 .
An audit earlier this year found that at least $ 1m -LRB- £ 700,000 -RRB- a month was lost in payments to `` ghost workers &apos;&apos; and other financial malpractice .
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts , even after a person dies or leaves the public service , reports the BBC &apos;s Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital , Nairobi .
All public servants are required to present themselves over the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure their data is captured through the biometric registration exercise , a government statement said .
Anyone who failed to do so without a valid excuse would be eliminated from the payroll , it said .
`` This exercise will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to cleanse the payroll at both levels of government- hence bring a stop to the issue of ` ghost workers &apos; , &apos;&apos; said Anne Waiguru , the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Devolution and Planning .
Tens of Turkish Policemen Arrested over ` Plotting &apos; against Gov&apos;t
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicions of ` plotting against the government &apos; , local media outlets say .
Police officials have not immediately commented .
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers , according to Hurriyet Daily News .
Some of them were involved in last December &apos;s corruption probes targeting government officials , including four government ministers .
In July a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly having set up an organized criminal gang and having tapped phone number .
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -LRB- who was Prime Minister back then -RRB- described their actions as part of activity conducted by Islamist cleric Fethullah Gullen against him and others in power .
Not all children back to school in Ukraine
Schools across most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday -LRB- September 1 -RRB- , after the summer holidays .
The day is traditionally a big one for families , and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school .
While there , he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened , but that he was committed to defending the country for future generations :
The first of September ceremony was not held in every school .
There is not a peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine .
We must fight for a peaceful sky .
The whole of Ukraine , a huge joint Ukrainian &apos;s people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
Aleksan Pastukhov , the head teacher of Slaviansk School , attended by Yatsenyuk &apos;s daughter , spoke in Russian .
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives .
The first day back at school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts , carrying balloons and giving flowers to their teachers .
In Rona Fairhead , the BBC may have found the formidable chief it needs
She comes trailing clouds of glory from the world of banking , media management and the inner conclaves of the Tory party .
Indeed , she has had frontline experience of her own .
Her career began at global management consultants Bain and Co , then progressed via Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI and the media world of Pearsons .
She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years , resigning when the top job at its parent company Pearson &apos;s went to a junior male colleague .
Her pay-off is said to be close to £ 1 million .
Her political rating is sturdy , too .
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne , the former head of BP , when he was looking to bring private expertise into Whitehall : she became a cabinet office adviser .
Her husband is a former Tory councillor .
Back in May , I described the chairman &apos;s job as a poisoned chalice .
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is an inner paradox to its structure .
The trust faces in two directions : inwards as the upper tier of the BBC &apos;s own management hierarchy , but also outwards as the voice of public concern and disquiet when things go awry .
This is an almost untenable duopoly calling for complete root-and-branch reform .
But what incoming chairman would risk coming in , crashing around and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty in case they put themselves out of a job in the process .
It &apos;s a difficult call .
If that were n&apos;t tough enough , plenty of people are keen to see the BBC cut down in size - its power , its finances and its status overhauled .
As competitors circle ever closer and new technology challenges cosy old certainties , the imminent negotiation of the licence fee is fraught with especial danger for the BBC .
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 a year , the British public buys into what is surely the greatest media enterprise in the world .
The BBC tells a good story : it claims that its output reaches 96 per cent of households , and costs each one of them just 40p a day .
What &apos;s more , apparently the Beeb &apos;s popularity is rising : 53 per cent support today as against 31 per cent 10 years ago .
Patterns of watching and using the BBC have changed : I receive news headlines on my mobile phone these days , and catch up on missed programmes with iPlayer .
But it remains a much-loved and formidable institution .
It needs a formidable chairman - I hope it has found one .
Texas &apos; Perry Says Disparaging Tweet Unauthorized
A tweet from Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry &apos;s verified account on Sunday night included a disparaging image of the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of his criminal indictment on charges of abuse of power .
The tweet was later deleted , followed by another from Perry &apos;s account that disavowed the post .
A tweet just went out from my account that was unauthorized .
`` I do not condone the tweet and I have taken it down , &apos;&apos; the later post said .
Perry aides did not immediately return messages seeking comment .
Although the tweets were sent from Perry &apos;s verified account , it was unclear who does the actual posting for the feed .
The earlier tweet posted an unflattering mock image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg , who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013 .
Perry vetoed funds to her office when she refused to resign , which led to a grand jury in Austin this month indicting Perry - who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate .
The caption on the tweet reads : `` I do n&apos;t always drive drunk at 3x the legal blood alcohol limit ... but when I do , I indict Gov. Perry for calling me out about it . &apos;&apos;
I am the most drunk Democrat in Texas .
Lehmberg &apos;s office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Perry .
It was handled by Michael McCrum , a San Antonio-based special prosecutor who was assigned by a Republican judge .
Perry has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy .
His high-powered legal team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the indictment , claiming that the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutionally vague .
Perry cut off $ 7.5 million in state funds to the state &apos;s Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and prosecutes public corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign .
That veto drew a formal complaint from a left-leaning watchdog group .
Perry &apos;s verified account is updated frequently - and sometimes famously .
After finishing in fifth place in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign , Perry addressed speculation that he might call it quits with a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake , and the words , `` Here we come South Carolina ! &apos;&apos;
Berkeley says housing market back to `` normal &apos;&apos;
One of London &apos;s most prominent property developers has warned that the housing market in southeast England has `` reverted &apos;&apos; to normal levels of activity .
Homes in the capital have been the subject of red-hot demand and surging prices , with widespread fears of a credit bubble prompting the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage borrowing in June .
Tony Pidgley , founder and chairman of upmarket housebuilder Berkeley , on Monday said : `` Since the start of the current financial year , the market has reverted to normal transaction levels from the high point in 2013 , &apos;&apos; adding that this offered a `` stable operating environment . &apos;&apos;
London &apos;s property market fared well during the downturn as foreign buyers piled into the capital .
Prices in the city have leapt 18.5 per cent in the past year alone , according to Land Registry data , far outstripping the 6.7 per cent average for England and Wales as a whole .
Average selling prices on Berkeley &apos;s private , affordable and student schemes have risen by about a fifth in the past year , reaching £ 423,000 at the end of April .
However , a strengthening pound has in recent months made London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential `` mansion tax &apos;&apos; ahead of the general election next May .
London estate agent Foxtons last week warned that April &apos;s Mortgage Market Review , which introduced tougher lending rules , would also spark lower rates of market growth in both property sales transactions and prices during the second half of the year .
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of mortgage approvals in July , further suggesting the housing market is cooling .
Hamptons International , another estate agent , has cut its 2015 forecast for London property price growth to 3 per cent on the basis that house price sentiment is already starting to weaken .
Transaction volumes have meanwhile dropped by a quarter year on year in London &apos;s most expensive postcodes , such as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington , according to agent WA Ellis .
Still , appetite for homes in the capital has been a boon to Berkeley , pushing up cash due on forward sales to more than £ 2.2bn .
Mr Pidgley added : `` Demand for the right product with good design in the best locations has remained resilient and , reflecting this , forward sales have been maintained . &apos;&apos;
In June the company reported it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007 .
Annual pre-tax profits rose 40 per cent year on year to £ 380m , on revenues up 18 per cent to £ 1.6bn .
Speaking on Monday ahead of the company &apos;s annual meeting , Mr Pidgley said Berkeley &apos;s earnings for the year were anticipated to be in line with current market expectations .
Analyst consensus is for full-year pre-tax profit of £ 450m .
Berkeley shares were flat at £ 23.96 in afternoon London trading .
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence leaked online by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards .
Nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence have been leaked online by a hacker who claimed to have a `` master list &apos;&apos; of images of 100 other starlets .
A representative for the star of `` The Hunger Games &apos;&apos; confirmed the photos of Lawrence were real and blasted the hacker for `` a flagrant violation of privacy . &apos;&apos;
The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence .
The photos , which originally were posted on the image-sharing site 4chan , were purportedly obtained through a weakness in Apple &apos;s iCloud online storage system , and a purported `` master list &apos;&apos; of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars , including Rihanna , Kim Kardashian , Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen , according to BuzzFeed .
It is not clear how many of the images are authentic , though `` Scott Pilgrim vs. the World &apos;&apos; star Winstead took to Twitter to denounce the hack as well .
`` To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home , hope you feel great about yourselves , &apos;&apos; Winstead tweeted .
However , Victoria Justice , of the Nickolodeon series `` iCarly &apos;&apos; and `` Victorious , &apos;&apos; denied that the photos were of her , tweeting , `` These so called nudes of me are FAKE people .
Let me nip this in the bud right now . *pun intended* .
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied that purported photos of her were authentic .
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson &apos;s acclaimed new novel about love and the letter ` J &apos;
They dissolved , that was the best way of putting it , they gradually came apart like a cardboard box that had been left out in the rain .
Just occasionally a woman told him he was too serious , hard-going , intense , detached , and maybe a bit prickly .
And then shook his hand .
He recognised prickly .
He was spiny , like a hedgehog , yes .
The latest casualty of this spininess was an embryo-affair that had given greater promise than usual of relieving the lonely tedium of his life , and perhaps even bringing him some content .
Ailinn Solomons was a wild-haired , quiveringly delicate beauty with a fluttering heart from a northern island village more remote and rugged even than Port Reuben .
She had come south with an older companion whom Kevern took to be her aunt , the latter having been left a property in a wet but paradisal valley called , felicitously , Paradise Valley .
No one had lived in the house for several years .
The pipes leaked , there were spiders still in the baths , slugs had signed their signatures on all the windows , believing the place belonged to them , the garden was overgrown with weeds that resembled giant cabbages .
It was like a children &apos;s story cottage , threatening and enchanting at the same time , the garden full of secrets .
Author &apos;s view : Howard Jacobson , whose novel `` J &apos;&apos; is longlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2014 .
The shortlist is announced next week
Kevern had been sitting holding hands with Ailinn on broken deckchairs in the long grass , enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon , the pair of them absent-mindedly plugged into the utility console that supplied the country with soothing music and calming news , when the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer his father had liked listening to with the cottage blinds down .
Your feet &apos;s too big .
On account of their innate aggressiveness , songs of that sort were no longer played on the console .
Not banned - nothing was banned exactly - simply not played .
Encouraged to fall into desuetude , like the word desuetude .
Popular taste did what edict and proscription could never have done , and just as , when it came to books , the people chose rags-to-riches memoirs , cookbooks and romances , so , when it came to music , they chose ballads .
Carried away by the day , Kevern began to play at an imaginary piano and in a rudely comic voice serenade Ailinn &apos;s big feet .
Ailinn did n&apos;t understand .
`` It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller , &apos;&apos; he told her , automatically putting two fingers to his lips .
This his father had always done to stifle the letter j before it left his lips .
It had begun as a game between them when he was small .
His father had played it with his own father , he &apos;d told him .
Begin a word with a j without remembering to put two fingers across your mouth and it cost you a penny .
It had not been much fun then and it was not much fun now .
He knew it was expected of him , that was all .
He had to explain what jazz was .
Ailinn had never heard any .
Jazz , too , without exactly being proscribed , was n&apos;t played .
Improvisation had fallen out of fashion .
There was room for only one `` if &apos;&apos; in life .
People wanted to be sure , when a tune began , exactly where it was going to end .
Wit , the same .
Its unpredictability unsettled people &apos;s nerves .
And jazz was wit expressed musically .
Though he reached the age of 10 without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior , Kevern knew of jazz from his father &apos;s semi-secret collection of old CDs .
But at least he did n&apos;t have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black .
Given her age , she was unlikely to have remembered a time when popular singers were n&apos;t black .
Again , no laws or duress .
A compliant society meant that every section of it consented with gratitude - the gratitude of the providentially spared - to the principle of group aptitude .
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and physique to entertainment and athletics , and so they sang and sprinted .
People originally from the Indian subcontinent , electronically gifted as though by nature , undertook to ensure no family was without a functioning utility phone .
What was left of the Polish community plumbed ; what was left of the Greek smashed plates .
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had n&apos;t quickly left the country while WHAT HAPPENED , IF IT HAPPENED was happening - fearing they &apos;d be accused of having stoked the flames , fearing , indeed , that the flames would consume them next - opened labneh and shisha-pipe restaurants , kept their heads down , and grew depressed with idleness .
To each according to his gifts .
Having heard only ballads , Ailinn was hard pressed to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever have been set to music .
Music was the expression of love .
`` They &apos;re not really insulting , &apos;&apos; Kevern said .
Except maybe to people whose feet are too big .
My father never insulted anybody , but he delighted in this song .
He was saying too much , but the garden &apos;s neglect gave the illusion of safety .
No word could get beyond the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves .
Ailinn still did n&apos;t comprehend .
Why would your father have loved something like that ?
He wanted to say it was a joke , but was reluctant , in her company , to put two fingers to his lips again .
She already thought he was strange .
`` It struck him as funny , &apos;&apos; he said instead .
She shook her head in disbelief , blotting out Kevern &apos;s vision .
Nothing to see in the whole wide world but her haystack of crow-black hair .
Nothing else he wanted to see .
`` If you say so , &apos;&apos; she said , unconvinced .
But that still does n&apos;t explain why you &apos;re singing it to me .
She seemed in genuine distress .
Are my feet too big ?
He looked again .
Your feet specifically , no .
Your ankles , maybe , a bit ...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick ?
Hate you ?
Of course I do n&apos;t hate you .
That &apos;s just the silly song .
He could have said , `` I love you , &apos;&apos; but it was too soon for that .
`` Your thick ankles are the very reason I &apos;m attracted to you , &apos;&apos; he tried instead .
I &apos;m perverse that way .
It came out wrong .
He had meant it to be funny .
Meaning to be funny often landed him in a mess because , like his father , he lacked the reassuring charm necessary to temper the cruelty that lurked in jokes .
Maybe his father intended to be cruel .
Maybe he , Kevern , did .
Despite his kind eyes .
Ailinn Solomons flushed and rose from her deckchair , knocking over the console and spilling the wine they &apos;d been drinking .
Elderflower wine , so drink was n&apos;t his excuse .
In her agitation she seemed to tremble , like the fronds of a palm tree in a storm .
`` And your thick head &apos;s the very reason I &apos;m perversely attracted to you , &apos;&apos; she said ...
Except that I &apos;m not .
He felt sorry for her , both on account of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes in the moment of her standing up to him .
Did she think he &apos;d strike her ?
She had n&apos;t spoken to him about life on the chill northern archipelago where she had grown up , but he did n&apos;t doubt it was in all essentials similar to here .
The same vast and icy ocean crashed in on them both .
The same befuddled men , even more thin-skinned and peevish in the aftermath of WHAT HAPPENED than their smuggler and wrecker ancestors had been , roamed angrily from pub to pub , ready to raise a hand to any woman who dared to refuse or twit them .
Thick head ?
They &apos;d show her a thick fist , if she was n&apos;t careful !
Snog her first - the snog having become the most common expression of erotic irritation between men and women ; an antidote to the bland ballads of love the console pumped out - snog her first and cuff her later .
An unnecessary refinement in Kevern &apos;s view , since a snog was itself an act of thuggery .
Ailinn Solomons made a sign with her body for him to leave .
He heaved himself out of the deckchair like an old man .
She felt leaden herself , but the weight of his grief surprised her .
This was n&apos;t the end of the world .
They barely knew each other .
She watched him go - as at an upstairs window her companion watched him go - a man made heavy by what he &apos;d brought on himself .
Adam leaving the garden , she thought .
She felt a pang for him and for men in general , no matter that some had raised their hands to her .
A man turned from her , his back bent , ashamed , defeated , all the fight in him leaked away - why was that a sight she felt she knew so well , when she could n&apos;t recall a single instance , before today , of having seen it ?
Alone again , Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet .
A score or so years before the events related above , Esme Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher employed by Ofnow , the non-statutory monitor of the Public Mood , prepared a short paper on the continuance of low- and medium-level violence in those very areas of the country where its reduction , if not its cessation , was most to have been expected , given the money and energy expended on uprooting it .
`` Much has been done , and much continues to be done , &apos;&apos; she wrote , `` to soothe the native aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in those twisted knarls and narrow crevices of the country where , though the spires of churches soar above the hedgerows , the sweeter breath of human kindness has , historically , been rarely felt .
But some qualities are proving to be ineradicable .
The higher the spire , it would seem , the lower the passions it goes on engendering .
The populace weeps to sentimental ballads , gorges on stories of adversity overcome , and professes to believe ardently in the virtues of marriage and family life , but not only does the old brutishness retain a pertinacious hold equally on rural communities as on our urban conurbations , evidence suggests the emergence of a new and vicious quarrelsomeness in the home , in the workplace , on our roads and even on our playing fields .
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to overwrite , &apos;&apos; her supervisor said when he had read the whole report .
May I suggest you read fewer novels .
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head .
I must also enquire : are you an atheist ?
`` I believe I am not obliged to say , &apos;&apos; Esme Nussbaum replied .
Are you a lesbian ?
Again Esme protested her right to privacy and silence .
A feminist ?
Silence once more .
`` I do n&apos;t ask , &apos;&apos; Luther Rabinowitz said at last , `` because I have an objection to atheism , lesbianism or feminism .
This is a prejudice-free workplace .
We are the servants of a prejudice-free society .
But certain kinds of hypersensitivity , while entirely acceptable and laudable in themselves , may sometimes distort findings such as you have presented to me .
You are obviously yourself prejudiced against the church ; and those things you call `` vicious &apos;&apos; and `` brutish , &apos;&apos; others could as soon interpret as expressions of natural vigour and vitality .
To still be harping on about WHAT HAPPENED , IF IT HAPPENED , as though it happened , if it happened , yesterday , is to sap the country of its essential life force .
Esme Nussbaum looked around her while Rabinowitz spoke .
Behind his head a flamingo pink LED scroll repeated the advice Ofnow had been dispensing to the country for the last quarter of a century or more .
Smile at your neighbour , cherish your spouse , listen to ballads , go to musicals , use your telephone , converse , explain , listen , agree , apologise .
Talk is better than silence , the sung word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
`` I fully understand the points you are making , &apos;&apos; Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice , once she was certain her supervisor had finished speaking , `` and I am saying no more than that we are not healed as effectively as we delude ourselves we are .
My concern is that , if we are not forewarned , we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED , IF IT HAPPENED , in the first place .
Only this time it will not be on others that we vent our anger and mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid of his fingers .
This was to suggest infinite patience .
`` You go too far , &apos;&apos; he said , `` in describing as `` mistakes &apos;&apos; actions which our grandparents might or might not have taken .
You go too far , as well , in speaking of them venting their `` anger &apos;&apos; and `` mistrust &apos;&apos; on `` others . &apos;&apos;
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past , as in protecting the present , we do not speak of `` us &apos;&apos; and `` them . &apos;&apos;
There was no `` we &apos;&apos; and there were no `` others . &apos;&apos;
It was a time of disorder , that is all we know of it .
`` In which , if we are honest with ourselves , &apos;&apos; Esme dared to interject , `` no section of society can claim to have acquitted itself well .
I make no accusations .
Whether it was done ill , or done well , what was done was done .
Then was then .
No more needs to be said - on this we agree .
And just as there is no blame to be apportioned , so there are no amends to be made , were amends appropriate and were there any way of making them .
But what is the past for if not to learn from it -
The past exists in order that we forget it .

Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid .

Lesotho military says no coup planned ; PM stays in South Africa
Lesotho military officials denied staging a coup to overthrow the government , saying they were acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics .
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country , saying the country &apos;s military had surrounded his official home and seized government buildings in the capital of Maseru .
The premier took his family to neighboring South Africa after saying he received an assassination threat .
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was not , in fact , a coup , but that the military was responding to a threat from `` political fanatics &apos;&apos; whom police were attempting to arm .
`` What happened this morning was that the command of the Lesotho Defense Force was acting after receiving several intelligence reports that amongst the police service , there are some elements who are actually planning to arm some of the political , party political youth fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc , &apos;&apos; he told Voice of America .
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military &apos;s actions had the appearance at an overthrow .
`` Although no one has claimed to have taken over government through the use of force , by all accounts the activities of the Lesotho defense force thus far bear the hallmarks of a coup d&apos;etat , &apos;&apos; he said .
Lesotho military officials said soldiers returned to their barracks Sunday and there was calm in the capital .
Meanwhile , Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing in control of the government in Thabane &apos;s absence .
Thabane said he believes he is being targeted due to his attempt to fight corruption in the country .
Tensions have been high in Lesotho since June when Thabane suspended parliament sessions due to feuding in his unity government .
He said his actions have not undermined the government , despite allegations otherwise .
Eurozone manufacturing at 13-month low
Manufacturing growth in the eurozone slowed to a 13-month low in August , according to a closely-watched survey .
The final Markit &apos;s Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers &apos; Index -LRB- PMI -RRB- dipped to 50.7 in August , down from 51.8 in July .
A figure above 50 indicates expansion .
New orders dwindled and factories suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
The figures come ahead of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- meeting on Thursday .
Markets will be looking for a clear plan from the bank to deal with a stalled eurozone recovery , as well as the threat of deflation with inflation standing at just 0.3 % .
There is speculation that ECB boss Mario Draghi could offer further indications later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone , similar to those taken by the UK and US during the financial crisis .
`` Although some growth is better than no growth at all , the braking effect of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers is becoming more visible , &apos;&apos; said Rob Dobson , senior economist at Markit .
The factory PMI for Germany , Russia &apos;s biggest trade partner in the EU , fell to an 11-month low of 51.4 .
Meanwhile , in the bloc &apos;s second-largest economy , France , the PMI fell to 46.9 .
France remains a real concern , as does Italy &apos;s descent from solid expansion to stagnation .
Signs that growth impetus waned in the key industrial engine of Germany , and in Spain and the Netherlands too , is also less than reassuring , &apos;&apos; Mr Dobson said .
The slowdown in industry is likely to add further fuel to the fire for analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented .
One positive note was from the Republic of Ireland , which saw its PMI grow to 57.3 , its highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economist at IHS Global Insight , said : `` The best that can be said for the August eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers &apos; survey is that it indicates that the sector is still growing . &apos;&apos;
He added : `` Eurozone manufacturers are clearly finding life very difficult at the moment as current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly related to Russia @/@ Ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries .
This heightened uncertainty has clearly hit business - especially , and consumer confidence , and it is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled , particularly big-ticket orders .
He said it was looking `` ever more likely &apos;&apos; that the ECB would ultimately have to undertake some form of QE , `` although we suspect that it will be limited . &apos;&apos;
The Beslan survivors &apos; decade of hell : Ten years since the horrific school siege , how the children caught up in it are still suffering
Ten years ago over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan , southern Russia
More than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity
Exactly a decade after the appalling Beslan school siege in which 334 perished , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
When fanatic Islamic terrorists kidnapped and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004 , at the start of a new term , it seemed like the nadir of all evil .
The tragedy united east and west in revulsion , which amazingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the direst misery .
Ten years on , we went back to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity .
We discovered amazing young people , who have defied adversity , though the memory of this terrorist hell will live with them forever .
Their greatest hope ?
That the war now scarring Ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop .
The girl pictured trying to climb back inside the blitzed school gym
She was famously snapped by top Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov wearing only her underwear as tried to climb back inside the blitzed school gym after a mine exploded .
Bewildered , Aida was desperately searching for her mother , Larissa , now 40 .
Both were feared dead , but in fact they survived .
` A woman told me to run for my life but I could n&apos;t , &apos; said Aida at the time .
My legs were covered in blood .
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mum .
A soldier plucked her to safety .
After a series of surgeries , she thought she had totally recovered but said yesterday : ` Three months ago , the pain came back .
I fear I may need more surgery .
Some shrapnel pieces are still in my knee .
Her aim now is to become a dentist , to help people as she has been aided by medics .
` This tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it , &apos; she said defiantly .
` It happened to me and you ca n&apos;t change this fact .
Once a year I always go to the gym to recall those who remained there .
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days .
The pain is too much .
My best friend and my classmate-to-be Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together .
` I do n&apos;t want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career .
I will think about a family later .
She says the siege remains with her though memories fade a little each year .
I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere .
When I see online the photograph of me climbing into the school window , I think that many people will see it for the first time , understand about our disaster , and stop this from happening any more .
The boy who fled through a hail of bullets believing his mother to be dead
He was on his first day at school -LRB- Russians start school aged 7 -RRB- and survived the three day siege hugging his mum Tamara .
Then seven he said : ` Mummy told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand . &apos;
After one explosion he thought she was dying .
She told him : ` Run &apos; .
Fearing she was dead , he fled and on his way he saw a crying toddler , grabbed the child by the hand , and fled through a hail of bullets .
His dad Vladimir , who scooped up his son outside , said : ` Damir told me his mother had died .
He said : ` I could n&apos;t save her &apos; . &apos;
In fact , Tamara had stumbled free and was in hospital with leg wounds , in turn believing her son had perished .
After their reunion she said : ` I wept with joy .
I could n&apos;t believe it .
He ran in and hugged me .
Damir was later flown to London -LRB- by the now defunct News of the World newspaper -RRB- to be crowned a Barnardo &apos;s Children &apos;s Champion by then premier Tony Blair and wife wife Cherie .
` This horror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop recalling it , &apos; he said yesterday .
Still I can say that in my mind it is fading .
I remember right afterwards , I threw away all my toy guns .
But now I can play computer games with shooting and it is not a problem for me .
` I &apos;m not scared to go back in the gym but I do n&apos;t think about myself .
I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard who never got out .
We never say they were killed or dead .
We say they stayed in the gym .
I remember my trip to London so well , specially the toy shop where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted , and riding in an open top car .
But now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misery he and his friends suffered .
This horror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop recalling it
` I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors , &apos; said Damir , who was last week doing voluntary work at a nunnery .
I want to help so much .
I want to serve in the police one day and hope they enrol me to the training academy next year .
His mother Tamara , 48 , said : ` 37 kids were killed in our neighbourhood , can you imagine ?
I remember terrible silence right after the siege , there were just no children to shout and run around , and that silence lasted for many months .
She vividly recalls her trip with Damir to London .
People in London were crying when I told our story .
I realised then how folk on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , can show their support .
She was grateful to ` Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004 .
I wish I could call Cherie and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London , and how that helped Damir and me .
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borsch soup , they called all the local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he was playing with waiters in a restaurant , Damir was shooting at them from his water pistol and they ran away and played with him .
And we were just one month away from our horror then .
I was amazed that the British people were so ready to share our pain and to support us .
She said : ` I keep thinking this world did not get better within these 10 years .
Now in Ukraine the war goes on , people are dying every day , and I believe many children were killed and will be killed .
They are just the same children , like ours .
I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bored or busy with something else .
I just know what those people feel , the horror of it .
And I ca n&apos;t stop feeling it .
Nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and it is so sad .
Damir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy , he is not at all aggressive or angry .
He is not seeking revenge for example , he is not preoccupied with this past horror .
I know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there .
When he was smaller he suffered from it - I remember he used to lie down on the sofa with his face turned away from us , for hours at a time .
Not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he threw away all his guns and other army-type toys.Damir is 17 now , taller than me , nice looking , clever and healthy .
I can hardly believe that for some hours I was so sure he was dead and I &apos;d never see him again .
When I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around , I saw the hell around me , when body parts were lying everywhere .
I was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survived in this hell .
` I remember I was shouting to him ` Damir , run , run away &apos; but again I was so sure he had not heard me .
But he did hear , and he did run away .
So life goes on for us unlike for so many .
Georgy Ilyin , 17
The boy whose shocking image after the siege came to define the horror of Beslan
Comfort : Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mum Fatima after the siege in 2004 , while on the right is Georgy today
His bloodstained face was etched with fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates .
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity at Beslan .
His mother Fatima , 54 , a senior GP , had dropped him for his first day at school before rushing to take her elder son Vladimir to university .
` I left two minutes before the terrorists rushed into the yard , so my little boy was left there alone for three days of horror , &apos; she recalled .
Not completely alone , we had a family of relatives there but all of them were killed .
Only my Georgy managed to survive .
The closer this date is , the harder it is to think and talk about it .
There is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy .
We do not feel it was long ago , I think it happened yesterday , some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time .
Nobody will ever forget , I promise you .
Haunting : The image of Georgy -LRB- left -RRB- was one of the most shocking of the attack and has been immortalised in a statue -LRB- right -RRB-
I remember Georgy so much wanted to go to school on that day , he said he wanted to hug his teacher .
I only got to know he was alive when I saw him TV .
And now there is even a statue to crying Georgy in San Marino .
Georgy does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the bookcase in our home .
I understand , but I also think that thanks to this picture people from all over the world feel our pain .
Georgy says now : ` It &apos;s important this can never happen again .
` I doubt we &apos;ll ever know the truth .
People keep investigating such tragedies and never know the truth .
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine .
Will we ever know what caused it ?
This world is moving to something very bad .
` I ca n&apos;t understand how it happens , because if you ask people , no-one wants a war , so how does it happen ?
Ten years is nothing for such pain .
We need dozens of years to pass in order to forget it a little .
It affected my health and I still feel it .
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege but then it got better .
I got back to school later in 2004 , I was very scared every day .
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed .
This is why I keep going to the gym as each 1 September approaches .
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends .
It is hard for me to go inside the gym but I must do it .
I do not feel myself a victim , this story is the part of my past now .
I will not forget it but I do not feel sorry for myself .
My life goes on .
I finished school this year entered a medical university in Vladikavkaz .
I will learn to be a heart surgeon .
My first choice was to go in the army .
I wanted to be a military man , but my health did not let me .
I wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen .
Georgy Farniyev , 20
The boy who survived despite having been trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miraculous : Georgy Farniyev was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege but still managed to survive
As the siege was underway , he was pictured trapped inside the gym , sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
It is truly a miracle he was not killed .
` We feel as if it was just yesterday , &apos; said Georgy , who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the FSB , but was unable to because of damage to his health in the siege .
It is still with me , this is not something I left behind .
I am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - I must say this is not true .
` In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I did feel a bit better afterwards but I ca n&apos;t forget it .
And I would like to forget .
2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the gym again .
I lost consciousness .
I would never ever go there again and please do n&apos;t ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture .
Survivor : Georgy Farniev pictured today , with a photograph of him in hospital follwoing the siege on his laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day .
My friends know that I do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school .
In terms of physical condition I am well .
I should be careful with my knee which was injured but I walk fine now .
Still my health did not let me go and study in FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg as I wanted .
I sent my documents , including medical papers , and they replied it was not possible .
My second passion was animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have completed two years there .
He is learning to treat all animals ` from cats to cows &apos; .
He said : ` I know I would never tell my children about my experience .
This is not something children should know about , and of course not something they should experience .
His mother Marina , 42 , said : ` This pain never leaves me .
It is in my soul , worse when the anniversary gets close .
I will go and attend ceremonies being held to mark it .
I know Georgy wo n&apos;t go .
It must be even stronger for him because he was there and I was not .
I was waiting for him at home , not able to help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me.Here in Beslan the imprint is on everyone .
It stays with us .
Georgy is an adult now but that horror is still with him .
It is hard to accept it when something so terribly unfair happens to you .
He is a boy , he likes sports but he ca n&apos;t take part because of his knee .
He had several surgeries , he walks but can not exercise .
I would say he 50 % overcame this horror , but one can never completely overcome and forget it .
This horrible experience will stay with us .
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege , and it only adds to my pain .
I lost many people I knew well and they were dear for me .
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed .
I know families where new children were born , but also widows who never married again .
It is hard to accept that life goes on , even if you do not want it .
I will never forget my heart jumping out of my chest at the moment I saw him in hospital .
Now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions .
What are those people fighting for ?
Why are they killing each other ?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it .
We used to be one friendly country in the past , how did it happen that we are fighting now ?
People and children are suffering , I am sure many children were already killed in Ukraine and many will be killed .
If we could only grab all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as possible .
Alyona Tskaeva , 10
The baby who was carried poignantly to safety by a special forces commando
Saved : Alyona Tskaeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces commando -LRB- left -RRB- .
She is now ten -LRB- right -RRB- and has no memory at all of the atrocity
The world gasped in 2004 when baby Alyona was carried out of the Beslan siege cradled in the arms of a Russian policeman .
Terrorists let her go but cruelly kept her 30 year old mother , ten year old older sister Kristina , and brother Makhar in the school gym .
Makhar , then three , escaped , but Alyona &apos;s mother and sister died in the murderous carnage .
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and with his new wife Svetlana he has a baby girl , who he named Kristina after the daughter he lost .
Alyona , now ten , has no memory of the siege and has blossomed into a bright and happy girl , say neighbours .
` They are a big happy family now and Alyona and Makhar are both great kids , &apos; said a close friend .
Ruslan is a fantastic dad and wants to get them away from all the memories as the tenth anniversary is marked .
You can understand why .
Man accused of knocking down girl on Fife pelican crossing
A 78-year-old man is to stand trial accused of running over a three-year-old girl on a pelican crossing in Fife .
Gordon Stewart is alleged to have knocked down the girl on a crossing in Pittenween in East Neuk .
Prosecutors said Mr Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and knocked the girl down to her injury .
Stewart , 78 , from Anstruther , denied the charge at Dundee Sheriff Court .
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set a trial date in January .
4 tips for better underwater photos and video
If you &apos;re interested in shooting photos or video underwater , you have a variety of equipment choices .
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot , such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam , such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition , which both go for around $ 300 .
I shot these photos at a family party using several cameras , all priced under $ 350 .
No matter what gear you use , a few rules apply for getting the best results .
Double-check your gear .
Even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the camera &apos;s battery and other compartments are tightly closed .
Also , set your camera to match the type of photos or video you &apos;ll be shooting .
Some cameras and camcorders have scene or shooting modes that will optimize the exposure for dim undersea settings .
And before you jump in , know how deep your equipment can go .
Some cameras are rated to only 5 feet , others to 50 or 60 feet .
Check out our buying guide and Ratings for digital cameras for both conventional and waterproof models .
Take multiple shots - because many of them wo n&apos;t work .
Point-and-shoot cameras have LCDs to help you compose photos , while action cams generally do n&apos;t .
Even if you have an LCD , it &apos;s going to hard to see it underwater , and composing your shot will be a hit-or-miss process .
So shoot multiples .
Also , if your camera has a bracket mode , which shoots a burst of shots at slightly different exposure settings , take advantage of it .
Stay near the surface .
Light falls off dramatically the deeper you dive underwater .
If possible , stay close to the surface when you shoot in a pool , a lake or the ocean .
This will also allow you to capture more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you &apos;ll see .
Get close to your subjects .
This is great advice for shooting on dry land , but it is even more important underwater because of the dim lighting conditions .
It &apos;s particularly important if you &apos;re shooting with an action cam : These devices often have a fixed , wide angle lens , which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the picture frame .
Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose force of personality could shake things up , even in a gargantuan organisation like the NHS .
A consultant anaesthetist , he devoted his career to sparing the sick both the agonies of illness and the torments of treatment .
Among those who sought him out , his wife remembers , was an MI6 officer who had to live with the crippling after-effects of torture .
Lawson understood that while doctors are captivated by diagnoses and diseases , those being treated are overwhelmingly concerned with something else entirely : pain .
One day in 2007 , however , he was the one who began to suffer .
`` I have not felt myself , &apos;&apos; he wrote in May that year .
I &apos;ve had difficulty in energising myself .
Struggling with flu-like symptoms , he found himself impatiently berating his wife , Juliet .
`` I want everything to happen sooner rather than later , &apos;&apos; he noted .
When Juliet went away on business for a week , Lawson found himself unusually , and unaccountably , upset .
Something was up .
He got a colleague to perform a chest X-ray .
Just two weeks earlier he had been skiing in the French Alps .
The results of the X-ray came back .
He had mesothelioma , an incurable cancer that affects the pleura , or lining of the lung .
With most cancers , it is hard to know the exact cause .
Though some smokers get lung cancer , for example , not all lung cancer sufferers have smoked .
But mesothelioma is different .
In almost every case , the cause is exposure to asbestos - a fibrous building material once dubbed `` miraculous , &apos;&apos; but now known to be mortally dangerous .
For most of us , mesothelioma has been an easy disease to ignore .
Asbestos , after all , is a product of the past .
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s , when a voluntary industry ban came into effect .
Even when it was used , only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pipe laggers , builders , carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
An industrial toxin from another era , it hardly seems cause for concern today .
But such complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it turns out , is today at the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic .
There are more mesothelioma deaths here than in any other country on the planet .
With an annual toll of about 2,500 , more than twice as many people die of the disease as die in accidents in motor vehicles .
Mesothelioma annual deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason that we are feeling its deadly effects now is that , though asbestos use has been illegal for years -LRB- all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999 -RRB- , it usually takes decades for mesothelioma to develop .
And the mesothelioma scourge is not confined to veterans of industrial building jobs .
Asbestos has been , and in many cases still is , embedded in the homes we live in , the offices we work in , the schools we are educated in , and the stores we shop in .
As a result , mesothelioma is no respecter of class , wealth , occupation , or age .
The bastions of privilege , from smart London department stores to public schools , have proved no refuge .
The Houses of Parliament are riddled with asbestos .
Even the hospitals that are meant to make us better have been reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
Nor was he a pipe lagger .
In fact , he struggled to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos .
Then he put his finger on it .
`` It seems that there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy &apos;s Hospital where I spent six years training , &apos;&apos; he wrote .
Everybody - students , nurses , doctors and porters - used the tunnels .
One wonders how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease ?
It was a question to which , sadly , he was able to provide a partial answer .
`` Of four doctors who trained at Guy &apos;s Hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma in the past five years , &apos;&apos; he noted in a letter in 2010 , `` I am the only one left alive . &apos;&apos;
How many of us will get this disease ?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 .
When he died , on February 17 this year , he was 55 .
To survive so long is unusual .
Fifty per cent of mesothelioma sufferers are dead 8 months after diagnosis .
It is always fatal .
So now we can only echo Lawson &apos;s question : `` How many of us will get the same disease ? &apos;&apos;
According to Britain &apos;s leading expert on mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , our best guess is that between 1970 and 2050 , when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should have played itself out , some 90,000 people will have died .
Most currently have no idea that they will die this way .

A quick glance at the reports from the courts , where those affected often turn for compensation , shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma has spread .
This June , for example , Marks &amp; Spencer admitted negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos .
She worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 , supervising clothes sections at two sites - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street .
Mrs Allen was only 18 when she started working at M &amp; S .
Now she has two children in their 20s .
`` Before this happened , &apos;&apos; she says , `` I had never heard of mesothelioma , I barely knew about asbestos .
I never would have dreamed that I would be affected by it .
Few people do know much about asbestos .
In fact , asbestos describes not one substance but a group of six minerals .
They get their name from the word `` asbestiform &apos;&apos; - which describes the fibrous structure which endows them with strength and flexibility .
Of the six , three have commonly been used in the building trade .
Chrysotile , commonly known as White Asbestos , is by far the most frequently found in buildings today .
It was used in roofing panels , floor tiles , pipe insulation , boiler seals , even brake linings in cars .
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos , but it &apos;s still considered a `` major health hazard &apos;&apos; that can kill by the EU and WHO .
More dangerous , however , are Brown Asbestos -LRB- amosite -RRB- and Blue Asbestos -LRB- crocidolite -RRB- .
Britain was once the world &apos;s largest importer of Brown Asbestos , and experts suggest that `` there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major cause of the uniquely high mesothelioma rate -LSB- in the UK -RSB- . &apos;&apos;
A Marks &amp; Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at its flagship store in Oxford Street , London Alamy
Janice Allen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma , but Julian Peto &apos;s work suggests that her story is far from uncommon .
He has produced a study of sufferers which suggests that `` a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas with no known occupational or domestic exposure were probably caused by environmental asbestos exposure . &apos;&apos;
Much of that exposure , he says , is due to `` normal occupation and weathering &apos;&apos; of our buildings .
No one , it seems , can be sure that they are safe .
A report from Goddard Consulting , which looked at the Palace of Westminster , shows how people , even in the heart of government , might have been exposed unawares .
In 2009 Goddard reported that service shafts and piping ducts behind Parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos , whose lethal fibres could be disturbed by something as innocuous as `` strong currents of air . &apos;&apos;
MPs are frequently accused of looking after their own interests , but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true .
While the Parliamentary Works Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been given `` a clean bill of health , &apos;&apos; it is now accepted £ 1bn of work lasting several years is required to overhaul Parliament , upgrading electrics and removing asbestos , and that after the 2015 general election MPs may sit in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than on the Green Benches at Westminster .
The Goddard report noted that `` the presence of asbestos has not been managed in accordance with the various regulations . &apos;&apos;
It is impossible to know if this mismanagement will cost lives .
All anyone can do now is wait .
One person who has never been able to pinpoint his exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott , a GP .
Like Andrew Lawson , Abbott , 50 , suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals .
`` I have worked at a hospital where positive asbestos claims have been made , &apos;&apos; he says , `` But I ca n&apos;t prove it in my case .
It &apos;s so hard to remember all the places one has worked in , and the dates .
What he remembers clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fever .
He was 45 , and in the middle of a late evening surgery .
Suddenly I started feeling shivery .
It came on very quickly .
I felt dreadful .
I did n&apos;t think I was going to be able to drive all the way home .
Being a doctor , Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pleura , the lining around his lungs .
But like Janice Allen , he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma .
He ended up spending a month off work .
Puzzled doctors gave him chest X-rays , and administered pleural catheters to draw off fluid from the lungs and send it for assessment .
Yet the condition went undiagnosed .
Slowly his health improved and he went back to work .
But from time to time the same symptoms returned , often after he took exercise and was breathing hard .
In 2011 , one of Abbott &apos;s patients arrived at his GP &apos;s surgery with similar symptoms to him , and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma .
But even then Abbott did n&apos;t make the connection with his own case .
After all , his patient was decades older , and had worked directly asbestos .
The link in that case was clear .
In September 2011 , Abbott &apos;s condition worsened again , and his consultant took his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott started feeling unwell , a probe , equipped with a camera , was fed into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung .
I &apos;m an optimist .
I tend just to plod along , &apos;&apos; he says .
I had n&apos;t worried about it too much to be honest .
But Rachel , my wife , was worrying .
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year : `` I was told it was mesothelioma . &apos;&apos;
Graham Abbott : diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott was plunged into meetings with Macmillan nurses , one of whom suggested that he should get in touch with a lawyer .
That was when he realised the scale of the epidemic .
`` It turns out that asbestos was widely used , particularly in big public buildings which quite often had asbestos lagging on the pipes , &apos;&apos; he says .
People who were exposed to asbestos in those buildings are now coming down with the disease .
So mesothelioma is now affecting younger people not in the typical professions .
The most dangerous asbestos-lagged pipes in hospitals were below ground level , so patients are unlikely to have been affected .
But many staff , walking in pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another -LRB- like Andrew Lawson -RRB- , or eating in basement canteens -LRB- as Graham Abbott frequently did -RRB- almost certainly did come into contact with the toxic substance .
For several decades after the war , it turns out , hospitals were potentially life-saving places for patients , but life-threatening places for the doctors who treated them .
It is still being removed today .
Pupils perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats
And it is not just hospitals .
Asbestos was frequently used in offices , shops , libraries and town halls for its marvellous insulating and flame-retarding properties .
Schools too .
In fact many people will have been first exposed to asbestos in the classroom .
Up and down the country , in myriad chemistry lessons , pupils have perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats .
Websites have sprung up to address the issue of asbestos in schools .
Meanwhile , in our homes , items as innocuous as floor tiles or shed roofs have routinely contained asbestos .
`` It &apos;s an industrial poison built into large amounts of our housing stock , &apos;&apos; notes Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his case against Guy &apos;s Hospital .
In one case the only contact the woman sufferer could think of was pulling down a garden shed in the 1970s .
So be careful how you pull down the garden shed .
The impact of diagnosis , knowing that the disease is incurable , is huge .
`` It takes a while to sink in , &apos;&apos; says Graham Abbott .
I went back to work and tried to carry on but realised that I could n&apos;t concentrate on what I was doing .
I was at the surgery for two weeks .
Then I realised that I would have to leave and sort myself out .
Well , I wo n&apos;t see Christmas again
One of the hardest things was moving from the position of doctor to that of patient .
Like countless patients before him , he remembers feeling bewildered by the amount of information to get to grips with .
`` It was hard to take everything in , &apos;&apos; he says .
`` I asked my consultant `` How long do I have ? &apos;&apos;
I was quoted about 12 months .
I remember thinking `` Well , I wo n&apos;t see Christmas again .
That &apos;s it . &apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;
Mesothelioma is particularly pernicious , because it is the mechanics of how we stay alive - the very act of breathing - that causes the cancer that kills .
Most Mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos .
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibres .
When the asbestos is disturbed and the fibres are inhaled , they can become embedded in the pleura , the lining of the lungs .
Asbestos fibres irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations .
`` The problem comes from inhaled needle-shaped fibres of asbestos , &apos;&apos; Professor Tom Treasure , a cardio-thoracic surgeon who moved in 2001 to Guy &apos;s Hospital .
The very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos is now , ironically , a leading centre in treating mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson , and treated some others who are likely to have been exposed while training at the hospital .
Once the asbestos needles get into the lung tissue , says Treasure , `` the act of breathing pushes them on the periphery , which is where the lining is .
It is by its nature invasive from the very beginning .
The normal options for treating other forms of cancer work less well with mesothelioma .
The effectiveness of surgery , for example , is hotly debated .
Some feel it is worth trying .
Treasure disagrees .
`` You ca n&apos;t excise the pleura , &apos;&apos; he says .
You ca n&apos;t get your knife round it .
Meanwhile the cancer `` is not very responsive to chemotherapy , &apos;&apos; which `` has an effect &apos;&apos; but does not cure .
`` Every now and again you get long survivors , &apos;&apos; says Treasure .
But in the end they all die .
Happily , some patients do live far , far beyond expectations .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
Two-and-a-half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Abbott is still battling on .
After contacting mesothelioma Abbott was put in touch with Andrew Lawson , who , four years after his diagnosis , had become a one-man support and advice bureau for fellow sufferers .
`` Hello , Cancer Central , &apos;&apos; he would announce cheerily when they called .
`` He was very positive , &apos;&apos; says Abbott .
He had been diagnosed 4 years before and was still very active .
Initially , Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months , and likely prolong his life by just one month .
`` I felt desperate , &apos;&apos; he says .
I felt like giving up .
Lawson , however , `` managed to put a slightly better tint on things . &apos;&apos;
After seeing several consultants , Abbott decided to pursue his treatment with Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski , professor in thoracic surgery at Guy &apos;s .
`` We had an advantage in that I did n&apos;t have to be referred , I just rang them up and they saw me , &apos;&apos; Graham admits .
The average patient would have to get a referral and have funding approved .
Money is crucial for those with mesothelioma to pursue the best available treatments .
But when those treatments eventually , inevitably , fail , many sufferers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind .
And so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan , from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
`` It has been known that asbestos is noxious to health since 1898 , &apos;&apos; says Morgan .
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was realised that even very low levels could be a risk to health .
That is where company negligence came in .
Andrew Lawson and Guy &apos;s hospital eventually settled their case , but it was not what Morgan calls a `` full-value settlement &apos;&apos; since Lawson could not prove definitively that his mesothelioma was down to asbestos exposure at Guy &apos;s .
After the inquest into his death , a spokesman for Guy &apos;s did confirm , however , that `` the asbestos in the basement area concerned was removed in the 1990s . &apos;&apos;
That was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How to remove asbestos
In fact , pinning lethal asbestos exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation .
Many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business .
Insurance records may have been lost .
And those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side , which the claimants certainly do not .
In response , this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mesothelioma to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be traced .
The law has created a £ 350m pot of money , funded by the insurance industry , for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue .
In these cases sufferers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court might have awarded in a normal compensation case - about £ 120,000 .
About 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year .
Andrew Morgan , like many involved with mesothelioma sufferers , thinks that £ 350m represents `` a very good job &apos;&apos; for the insurance industry .
`` It &apos;s a deal written by insurers for insurers &apos;&apos; he says , suggesting that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the passage of time had not intervened , and mesothelioma sufferers were able to track down companies and sue them in the normal way .
Even Mike Penning , then Works and Pensions minister , admitted that the law was `` not perfect . &apos;&apos;
But both Penning and Morgan admit that , with seven victims dying each day , quick action was needed .
`` People are suffering so much , and need help today , &apos;&apos; said Penning during the Mesothelioma Bill &apos;s second reading in December last year .
By then , Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months .
After their initial consultations , Lang-Lazdunski advised surgery which , in contrast to Tom Treasure , he believes has a positive effect .
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tri-therapy for which Lang-Lazdunski can boast five year survival rates as high as 40 per cent .
Abbott felt empowered .
`` That of course is one of the most important things , &apos;&apos; says Abbott .
You see it in patients all the time .
There is some drive that keeps you going .
When you give up you can deteriorate very quickly .
Graham Abbott went in for surgery in March 2012 .
By the end of August he had completed the last of his six cycles of chemotherapy .
Follow-up scans revealed no sign of the disease .
Then I had my scan in March -LSB- 2014 -RSB- .
There was multiple spotting -LSB- of cancer -RSB- around my chest .
I was just about to turn 50 .
It &apos;s not life threatening .
It &apos;s life ending .
Once again Abbott put himself through six cycles of chemotherapy .
Now there is no sign of the tumours .
But the process is both physically and emotionally gruelling .
You have to think about practical things - about the finances when I &apos;m gone for example , or showing my wife how the boiler timer works .
When you get bad news you start getting negative .
You have to look forward .
As the father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , that is not always easy .
`` It &apos;s hard as a parent , &apos;&apos; he says .
It is difficult to know what to say and how much to say .
When I was first diagnosed I told the girls that I had a condition that meant I was n&apos;t going to become old .
They reacted very differently .
Tamsin is very sociable and boisterous .
She told her friends and we got lots of calls very quickly .
Ellie was more reserved .
She did n&apos;t say much .
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients must face .
But for mesothelioma sufferers such discussions are not leavened by hope , by even a glimmer of a possibility of survival .
The disease carries with it -LRB- even as it did , eventually , for Stephen Jay Gould -RRB- a grim certainty .
As Andrew Morgan says , `` mesothelioma is not life threatening .

China refuses to give Hong Kong right to choose leaders ; protesters vow vengeance
China &apos;s parliament decided Sunday against letting Hong Kong voters nominate candidates for the 2017 election , despite growing agitation for democratic reform .
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong &apos;s business district , as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement .
The decision by China &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to weed out any candidates not loyal to Beijing .
`` It &apos;s not unexpected , but it is still infuriating , &apos;&apos; said legislator Emily Lau , chairwoman of the Democratic Party .
This is not what Beijing promised .
They &apos;ve lied to the people of Hong Kong .
And it &apos;s clear we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
Defending China &apos;s ruling , Li Fei , deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People &apos;s Congress , said allowing public nominations in the election for Hong Kong &apos;s leader would be too `` chaotic . &apos;&apos;
Since 1997 , when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China , Beijing had promised to allow the region &apos;s residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 2017 .
Chinese leaders presented the Sunday ruling as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kongers a direct vote , but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nominating committee tightly controlled by Beijing .
And , according to a new clause , only candidates who `` love the country , and love Hong Kong &apos;&apos; would be allowed .
The ruling comes after a summer that has featured some of the largest and most high-profile protests in Hong Kong in years .
Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement , whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not grant authentic universal suffrage .
On Sunday night , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had assembled in the rain outside the Hong Kong government &apos;s headquarters .
At the demonstration , organizers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would mount waves of protests in the coming weeks .
However , they did not give details , apparently looking to avoid problems with authorities .
In an online statement , organizers said the movement `` has considered occupying Central only as the last resort , an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice .
We are very sorry to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen .
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing &apos;s announcement for days , and security was tight Sunday at the government headquarters , with police and barricades deployed .
Driving the unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city .
An influx of mainlanders is fueling competition for products and services .
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong &apos;s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , are beginning to bend under increasing pressure from Beijing .
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement , saying its demonstrations put business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong - at risk .
`` The protest they are talking about , it could result in much economic damage , depending on how many are involved and for how long , &apos;&apos; said legislator Regina Ip , who has long criticized the movement .
We do n&apos;t want concern to spread that Hong Kong is getting out of control .
This is a perception that is bad for investment .
China &apos;s state-run media also has run stories in recent days painting Hong Kong &apos;s democracy activists as agents of subversion directed by Western powers .
This summer , activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights that drew 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters .
And in July , tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region &apos;s history .
Pre-election propaganda ?
A League in Jihlava carries its name under a political movement .
Minor-league soccer is played in Vysočiny &apos;s regional capital by approximately 1,600 amateur athletes .
And their biggest competition is newly called the Together for Jihlava League .
The name is that of a political movement that is taking part in the October municipal elections .
Its tenth candidate is the head of the minor-league soccer team in Jihlava , Jan Mráka .
`` A plenary session was held , at which no one had a problem with the idea , &apos;&apos; Mráka explained .
The situation surrounding the first minor-league soccer team has already been addressed by lawyers for the Jihlava City Hall , and they have recommended changing the system of dividing grants .
Last year , around CZK 1 million was allocated for minor-league soccer by the city , according to its website .
This year too , it will receive hundreds of thousands .
According to the expressed legal opinion , the approach by the minor-league soccer team neither conflicts with the law nor with the City Hall &apos;s directives .
`` However , the situation gives the relevant authority a reason to change the rules for allocation of grants and subsidies , &apos;&apos; explained City Hall spokesman Radek Tulis .
Drawing grants from the city and at the same time expressing support for a single political party in the elections as the minor-league soccer team is probably not acceptable .
No similar request has yet been addressed to major-league soccer in Vysočiny by politicians .
Suppose , for example , that a Social Democratic Party regional championship , a Civic Democratic Party division or a Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People &apos;s Party 1 .
A category or similar competitive events were created .
I would not be in favor of it .
Instead , I would be glad if sponsors from a number of companies contacted us , &apos;&apos; said Regional Soccer Association Chairman Miroslav Vrzáček .
The head of minor-league soccer will not allow other parties or movements into the league &apos;s name .
According to minor-league soccer players , this sport in Jihlava deserves its own site with six fields , locker rooms and restrooms .
`` For example , the Na Stoupách field is not ours , we are renting it , &apos;&apos; pointed out Ondřej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlava .
Český mlýn would probably be the best location .
However , I believe that in that location a ridiculous site for skateboarders is going to be built there , and Jihlava already has about 50 of them , &apos;&apos; Mráka said .
Jihlava Mayor Jaroslav Vymazal -LRB- Civic Democratic Party -RRB- has reacted by noting that the minor-league soccer team uses a field with artificial turf on Rošického a Na Stoupách Streets , which are owned by the city .
`` We want to build a field that will have maximum use .
We are planning modernization or development of sports stadiums near schools , which will be accessible during afternoon hours .
I think major progress has been made in recent years for minor-league soccer , &apos;&apos; Vymazal added .
According to Jan Mráka , no other political parties will appear in the names of leagues .
`` We have limits .
If anyone from one field enters into a partnership with us , we no longer admit another one , &apos;&apos; he explained .
`` A political movement in the name of a league is something that I consider at least unfortunate , &apos;&apos; said Karel Voldán , a member of the City Council &apos;s commission for sports .
`` But let players decide whether Mr. Mráka is using Jihlava &apos;s minor-league soccer association and grants from the city for political purposes or not , &apos;&apos; he added .
US prom culture hits university life with freshers offered private jet entrances
We &apos;re excited to be answering this demand by launching the UK &apos;s first luxurious travel service for the students of today .
To make the maximum impact arriving at university , the company also offers transport options including private jet , Rolls-Royce Phantom , Aston Martin or McLaren P1 .
Mr Stewart also claimed the service had a safety aspect .
The service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to haul their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car .
Paired with our new VIF options , we &apos;re looking forward to ensuring this year students reach university with minimum fuss and maximum luxury .
A spokesman for the company said that because the service has just launched there have been no bookings yet but added that `` students will be booking the service over the next few weeks . &apos;&apos;
The company also said that despite students facing tuition fees of £ 9,000 a year , it still expected to find a market for the service .
Students of today are quite different in terms of expectations and aspirations , compared to students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it &apos;s more important than ever to make a great first impression and VIF is just the way to do that .
However , the National Union of Students criticised the service as out of touch .
Megan Dunn , NUS vice president for higher education , said : `` This scheme seems incredibly out of touch with the lives of the majority of students .
Many students starting university this month are facing a cost of living crisis , with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spiralling bills for basic essentials , before they can even start thinking about forking out thousands of pounds for something as simple arriving at their halls of residence .
Feminists take on race and police conduct post-Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo . , earlier this month .
Attendees hold their hands up while chanting , `` Hands up , do n&apos;t shoot , &apos;&apos; as they wait in line before the funeral .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo. over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown , blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists .
In her experience , white feminist commenters prioritized gender above race when it came to pushing forward reproductive rights and income inequality .
But as tensions rose in the Midwest and drew nationwide coverage , Perez saw responses from white women that centered 100 percent around race .
Compared to the responses of black women soon after the shooting on August 9 , the personal essays with titles like `` thoughts on ferguson as a white woman &apos;&apos; and `` Feminism Is Not Just About Women &apos;s Oppression &apos;&apos; came relatively late .
But to Perez , it demonstrated a significant shift .
`` In feminism , I do n&apos;t think you get a lot of people talking about whiteness and privilege in such a high level way , &apos;&apos; she said .
People felt called to voice something about what happened .
It &apos;s very emblematic of the crisis we face and because -LSB- the situation in Ferguson -RSB- is so racialized , they have to call that out .
For Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell , Ferguson brought to light issues that black American women face every day but that are n&apos;t seen as `` women &apos;s issues &apos;&apos; in the cultural sphere .
`` I can post something funny on Facebook about what &apos;s going on with me and my partner and it will get 150 likes from all over the place , &apos;&apos; said Mitchell .
When I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country , the silence is deafening .
`` How is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere ? &apos;&apos; she asked .
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race , gender and sexuality in U.S. history , there is no dichotomy between issues regarding race and gender .
To her , black women have not had the luxury of neatly separating the issues ; they live the combined reality every day .
While white women are now combining issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist spheres , Angela Hattery , women and gender studies professor at George Mason University , says their predecessors did the opposite .
`` Between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , &apos;&apos; said Hattery .
You needed the white woman to be complicit in the narrative to justify the lynching .
To Hattery , the breakdown between white and black women came when white suffragists like Susan B. Anthony surveyed the landscape in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for voting rights would only work for one group at a time : women or blacks .
`` They made the decision to put their eggs in the basket for votes for women and votes for Blacks would come later , &apos;&apos; said Hattery .
To look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color do n&apos;t trust white women .
We have n&apos;t done a good job .
We have n&apos;t helped black women protect their husbands and sons ever .
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women to organize against lynching as the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching .
The group came nearly 40 years after black women originally asked for assistance , said Mitchell .
To Mitchell , the upswell of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police conduct , racial discrimination - reflect the times white feminists have had to play `` catch up &apos;&apos; to issues black women have grappled with for generations .
`` Would n&apos;t it be great if the activists who have those -LSB- traditional feminist -RSB- platforms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control ? &apos;&apos; posed Mitchell .
Second wave feminists who made careers out of fighting for reproductive rights and access to birth control are now figuring out what that means .
Noted white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown &apos;s shooting to post a pointed column by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll that demanded more protest from white Americans on the issue of racism .
`` I hope women , who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger that is located in the body - and racial opinions that are measurably different in public polls - will lead the change , &apos;&apos; Steinem wrote .
Although Steinem has vouched for a more intersectional feminism that includes issues of race as well as gender , her comments on race in America still puzzle some .
American Enterprise Institute scholar Christina Sommers , author of `` Who Stole Feminism ? , &apos;&apos; told She The People that young men in the United States , especially young men of color , are `` far more vulnerable than their sisters , &apos;&apos; but Steinem &apos;s remarks on Ferguson counter the criticism she has launched in the past .
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But when the White House recently initiated a small program , My Brother &apos;s Keeper , to help vulnerable black and Hispanic young men , there was an angry reaction from many feminists , including Gloria Steinem .
Police relations with the black community is not the only issue pushing to the forefront of mainstream feminism .
After U.S. border patrol apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country &apos;s southwest border this year , immigration reform surfaced once again - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
Andrea Mercado , co-chair of We Belong Together , an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform , said that in order to rebrand the issue as essential for women , all she needed to do was share immigrant women &apos;s stories .
`` They speak for themselves , &apos;&apos; Mercado said .
When the vast majority of employment visas are given to -LSB- male immigrants -RSB- , the women who come with them are left in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories resonate with women &apos;s organizations , &apos;&apos; she said .
Ipswich ` pig in residence &apos; house for sale
A picture for a house for sale in Suffolk was removed by estate agents when it emerged it showed a large pig at rest in the living room .
On sale for £ 120,000 , the detached one-bedroom property sits on a private road in Ipswich .
The particulars featured a picture of the living room of the house - which included a pig with its head resting on a settee .
Estate agents Connells said the pig in the photo was the home owner &apos;s pet .
`` However , the photo was put up in error and has since been removed , &apos;&apos; a spokeswoman for the company said .
In the particulars for the property , Connells described the former meeting house as a `` unique one bedroom detached house . &apos;&apos;
Although the agency has removed the image from its website , it still appears in publicity material .
The house sale has sparked interest on social media , where some have enquired whether the pig is included in the sale .
SW town of Harvey has fresh millionaire after Lotto win
A Harvey lotto player is in the month .
The search is on for a new millionaire in Perth &apos;s south-west , with one lucky person taking home nearly $ 1.1 million from Saturday night &apos;s lotto draw .
A Harvey newsagency struck gold in the division one draw for the second time in five years , the last being $ 1 million in November 2009 .
However the lucky winner has yet to come forward .
Owner of the store Steve Forward said the win was creating a buzz around the small town in Perth &apos;s south west .
It &apos;s the talk of the town and everyone is pretty excited .
We thought a win like this might be close .
Eight WA winners have celebrated division one wins last month , capping off a lucky few weeks for the state &apos;s players .
Last week a Canning Vale player became one of five August millionaire &apos;s , following a Belmont couple &apos;s massive $ 7.5 million win only a few weeks prior .
The winning couple had played the game for twenty years and said the win gifted them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new house .
The Harvey millionaire brings WA up to 59 division one winners for the year , totalling in nearly $ 85 million .
Deutsche Bahn &apos;s trains will not run this evening .
The engineers want higher wages .
In a press statement , GDL described the protest as a warning strike , for which it intentionally chose a time outside of the peak period .
By selecting its time for the strike , GDL took into consideration the many people who did not return from their weekend away until during the next work day .
`` We also are thinking of people who leave for work during the day , &apos;&apos; the union said in a press statement on Monday morning regarding the announcement of the strike .
`` Our first strike is expected mainly to affect freight transport and will affect passengers less , &apos;&apos; GDL added .
DB has not yet released an official public reaction to the announced strike .
It is not clear either how the protest will affect international rail connections , including those with the Czech Republic .
The unions are demanding 5 % wage increases for engineers and shortening of their work period by two hours per week .
Engineers &apos; average wages currently range between 36,000 and 46,000 euros -LRB- CZK 998,0000 to 1.27 million -RRB- annually , depending on the number of years worked .
DB engineers work 39 hours per week .
DB is refusing to allow wages to increase while still shortening the work period .
The company points out that wage increases for engineers must develop in the same way as for other railway staff , whose work week DB does not intend to reduce .
There was a risk that Krest &apos;s car would catch fire .
Therefore , he finished at the Barum Rally .
What exactly happened ?
It was a material defect .
The car was brand new , so it did n&apos;t occur to me that something like that could happen .
Could n&apos;t the exhaust pipe be repaired temporarily to enable the car to be driven at a slower pace to a service center , where mechanics would replace it ?
If we had headed right there , then yes .
But another two special stages awaited us , so it was impossible .
There &apos;s a high temperature in it and there was a great risk that the car could catch on fire .
I can not allow that to happen .
At full pace , you managed five speed tests .
What was your impression from them ?
It was very good .
I felt like when I was younger .
We were fast , but I did n&apos;t go through with it .
Everything was caused by the fact that we worked on the car for more than half a year to get it to a certain level .
The race showed that we managed it .
Did you get so into it that you could n&apos;t really imagine victory ?
I prepared myself and the car so that we would really be in reach of victory .
Our work did n&apos;t result in nothing .
On the other hand , we did n&apos;t get the outcome that we had expected .
But that &apos;s the Barum Rally .
Technology unfortunately said no .
You were not the only one from the top who got out of the race for first place early .
Foreign favorites such as Breen , Abbring and Lappi did too .
Were you surprised that so many favorites withdrew ?
Yes .
Mainly for spectators , it was a pity , because it caused the race to end early .
Jaromír Tarabus , for you are preparing a car , was also at the top for a long time .
But he paid the price of veering from the route and suffered a loss of nearly two minutes .
How satisfied were you with his performance ?
It &apos;s a pity , because he could have repeated the winners &apos; levels .
After all , he drove the first two times .
Even Mira confirmed to me that we had prepared the car well .
He went very fast .
Exactly a year ago , you announced the end of your career , but you still showed up at the start of the Barum Rally .
Could your good feeling from this event make you a regular participant in rally races ?
Certainly not at this time .
Last year , I said that the Barum would be my last race , and I still did n&apos;t keep the promise .
I decided to race again .
It was my nineteenth start here , and if there &apos;s a chance in a year from now , then I will take it .
But I &apos;m not considering anything after that .
A lot of people came to the track just because of you .
Did it make you happy ? ?
To a certain extent , we started because of them .
A lot of people , people who I know and do n&apos;t know , constantly asked if I would race .
I wanted to make them happy .
What awaits you after the Barum ?
The team will press on .
Next week we are going to Vyškova , where Robert Adolf will race .
I hope he has n&apos;t damaged the car very much here .
Furthermore , for this race sometimes he wants to borrow the Fabia from Honza Sýkora .
With Mira , we will participate in European double races in Switzerland and Corsica .
For that , we will have to prepare some things for next year .
Can you already indicate anything ?
No , nothing has been decided .
When the Corsica rally belonged to the World Championship , you achieved fifth place , you maximum in the series .
Are n&apos;t you in the mood to try that track again ?
No , I &apos;m not .
A verbal agreement with an employer can be a problem .
Unfortunately , you have not yet had your physician issue a confirmation of your work disability , which serves as evidence for an organization that for health reasons you can not carry out your work duties .
Moreover , you did not immediately notify your employer of the absence .
Subsequently , although you reached an agreement that the particular days would be recorded as vacation , the agreement was made only verbally .
Although the Labor Office does not require an employee to have the employer &apos;s permission to take leave confirmed in writing , in practice this approach has proven effective .
If there is only a verbal agreement , then you wo n&apos;t have a confirmation of it .
Later , the supposed consent with drawing leave , like in your case , can be denied , and your absence from work can be evaluated as a long-term inexcusable absence and a reason for immediate termination of employment under Section 53 of the Labor Code .
Then if there is a court dispute about the agreement with the employer , you will lack provable evidence .
However , employment with you has not been canceled pursuant to Section 53 , you only have the particular days specified in your records as an inexcusable absence .
An inexcusable absence in your records will not have the same consequences as Section 53 -LRB- such as the inability to collect unemployment benefits -RRB- , even though it hinders your ability to seek new employment .
When recommend that you visit the particular doctor again and have the doctor issue written confirmation that an injury actually occurred , which made you unable to work -LRB- not a `` sickness confirmation , &apos;&apos; but only a document from the physician -RRB- .
When looking for new employment , you can submit the specified document and explain the situation .
It is a good idea not to underestimate either issuance of a physician &apos;s written confirmation of work disability or prompt notification of an employer or requesting written permission for drawing leave .
You will avoid potential complications .
Tony Stewart crashes in return to track
Tony Stewart &apos;s return to the track has ended only a little over halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway .
Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tire blew out on lap 172 , ending his night .
Stewart drove his battered car to the garage and then exited without speaking to reporters .
His crew chief Chad Johnston said the 14 team was disappointed , but will now start focusing on next weekend &apos;s race in Richmond , Virginia .
`` I wish we could have had a better effort and a better finish for him , &apos;&apos; Johnston said .
We &apos;ll go on to Richmond and hope we can do better there .
Stewart first went into the wall earlier in Sunday night &apos;s race following a collision with Kyle Busch , requiring work to the right side of his car .
`` I went into today with some pretty good hopes of finishing well , &apos;&apos; Johnston said , adding , `` It just did n&apos;t work out . &apos;&apos;
Not long after the second crash , Stewart &apos;s car was loaded onto the hauler and the team was packed up and ready to leave .
Stewart skipped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car struck and killed a fellow driver in a dirt-track race in upstate New York .
He decided to return this week , needing to win either at Atlanta or the next race at Richmond to claim a spot in the Chase .
He returned to work as an investigation into the tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr . , who had stepped on the track to confront Stewart during a race .
Authorities said Friday that the probe into the cause of the crash will last at least another two weeks .
No decision has been made about whether Stewart will face charges .
The three-time champion received a big cheer when he was introduced before the race .
Starting in the 12th spot , Stewart ran in the top 10 early in the race , getting as high as fourth .
Then , on lap 122 after a restart , Busch &apos;s No .
18 machine got loose coming out of turn 2 and banged into Stewart , sending both cars against the wall .
Stewart carried on but dropped back to 21st .
Prague chooses new taxi stand firm , it will earn 12.3 million
The City of Prague has completed a tender for a new manager of its taxi stands .
For 103 taxi parking locations , it will earn approximately CZK 12.3 million per year .
Until recently , it had been collecting CZK 150,000 for the same taxi stands .
The information was provided by City Council member Lukáš Manhart -LRB- TOP 09 -RRB- .
The city previously used drawings to select management companies .
The winner then got to manage the locations for a flat fee of CZK 1,000 per year .
However , the rules have changed .
The amount of the offer is currently decisive .
`` A year since the termination of the original contract and the start of the tender , it became apparent that the new system of leasing would be much more beneficial for Prague and entirely fair , &apos;&apos; the council member said .
The most expensive spot is on Na Perštýně Street .
The highest price has been offered by those interested in taxi stands on Na Perštýně Street .
They will pay CZK 2.1 million per year .
The new administrators paid approximately CZK 1.5 million for locations such as in front of the Municipal House and on Wenceslas Square .
The new rules for leasing taxi stands were adopted by council members in the autumn of 2012 , and last summer they terminated the original lease agreements .
The tender was held in four rounds , and the new administrator will get 29 taxi stands .
We had to clean the well for the second time this year already .
Each time , we completely emptied it , which practically created a second pond around the cottage .
Then we poured Savo into it .
What an incredible stench !
Our well in the basement always had plenty of fragrant water .
And it was not done professionally in who knows what way , but grandpa dug it one his own .
A long time ago .
It was just three rings and generally peculiar , just like everything else at the cottage , but as I say .
The water was great .
Until this year .
When we began the season , of course we pumped the water out .
It deserved to be pumped out , since it had been sitting for several months .
But even afterwards it seemed that the water somehow did n&apos;t smell good .
It occurred to us that something might have fallen in .
At the place where the pump went through , with a bit of bad luck it was possible , as a slab there was not entirely secluded , and the opening was sealed with a piece of brick .
Our inspection confirmed that the brick had moved .
Otherwise , nothing was visible in the water , and we shined all the way to the bottom .
So we emptied and cleaned it again .
Of course , we improved the improvised sealing around the pump pipe .
However , in the basement we noticed some strange things .
On the ground there was a package with some small cubes .
Or at least that &apos;s how they looked .
And there were more a little further away .
Now it looked like a slimy mouse .
By the ceiling , in locations where there were through vents , grandpa &apos;s discovery was found : pieces of fish !
And heavily eaten !
Our cellar is also strange .
Someone could say that grandpa in short dug under the cottage .
And that would not be far from the truth .
The walls and the floor are only compacted sand , and only the ceiling is wooden .
Mainly boats are placed there .
And bicycles .
And beach chairs .
The gate with wide gaps has usually been open , and someone always has been able to get through it .
By the ceiling there are already several of the mentioned vents .
Without a net , so birds regularly fly in and build their nests there .
It &apos;s needless to mention mice .
Grandpa wanted to ventilate , but it was n&apos;t going to happen .
Now of course , even air did not help .
The entire basement stank .
So we cleaned the entire basement .
That fish on the beam was especially nutritious !
We also threw away items that were nearby : boards , a heraclithic slab and more .
Our cottage welcomed passersby from afar with a disinfectant odor .
We thought about who could have brought those awful things in .
The nearest cat lives two kilometers way in a village .
It would have had a hard time coming to our cottage for a snack .
Grandpa thought it might have been one neighbor , who is not entirely in good condition .
He wondered whether it was Franta and if he had pushed the disgusting things through a vent .
It &apos;s been here practically all year , what stupid ideas he has .
We decided to monitor and regularly check the basement and the well .
After a few days , everything was fine .
We began using the water again , so far only for washing and cleaning , until the tests were ready to let us know that it was fine again .
Hauling water from a well in the forest is not something I would like to do for long .
Once we heard the frightening bark of our female dog .
Mom peered from the balcony and saw a long thick black hose in the grass next to the veranda .
Réza jumped over it and howled like crazy .
Mom scolded her , because she thought that Réza had dug up the waste hose from the sink .
But suddenly the hose was partially rolled up into a ball and partially straightened .
Then a hiss came from the balcony .
Réza became hysterical .
We ran down .
A grass snake , which was more than a meter long and as thick as a whip was planning to swallow a large toad , and Réza stopped it from doing so .
It was not clear whether she wanted to save the toad or if she herself wanted to eat it , but that &apos;s not what was important .
When the grass snake saw that it was outnumbered by our entire family , it must have figured we wanted to eat it , since we were so hungry , and it then elegantly crept into the vent leading to the basement .
We ran after it .
It jumped out of the well like lightning .
Then we noticed that there was another stinking package on the board .
From the smell , it must have been a fish .
It was not there the day before yesterday !
Our new reinforcement around the pump was a little crooked .
And we locked the basement even during the day .
Is it possible that ...
We rushed outside , and each of us approached one vent .
We did n&apos;t wait long .
Something was stirring in the well .
First a small flat head with yellow marigolds on its neck appeared .
Then the entire grass snake leaped from the well .
It moved around the pump and started going inside .
Fired worker gets revenge by buying company laptops and selling them
A disgruntled employee bought computers for the company where he worked and then sold them after being fired .
He managed to spend the money he made before the police arrested him .
Over a short period in twelve instances the man bought a total of 16 computers for more than CZK 200,000 .
`` After receiving the laptops , he took them to Olomouc , where he sold them to pawn shops , &apos;&apos; šumperské Police Commissioner Rostislav Brückner said .
The employee was motivated by a desire to get revenge for being fired and to make money .
`` During questioning he told us that he had used the money for loan repayments , &apos;&apos; Brückner said .
The police also discovered that the con-artist was a pathological gambler who had repeatedly received psychiatric treatment .
Therefore , the money could have ended up in game machines or video lottery terminals .
`` It &apos;s a fact that we did not find any money on him , &apos;&apos; the commissioner said .
The con-artist had already once been convicted of theft , and now he faces a prison sentence of one to five years .
The police have not yet said whether the pawn shops that bought the laptops at below their value and then sold them will also face charges .
`` It &apos;s true that they accepted completely new goods , which is at least suspicious , &apos;&apos; the commissioner said .
None of the pawn shop owners have yet been charged .
Come a little closer you can manage it , or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year the organizers have prepared a few changes .
The biggest is the change of route , which has moved the finish to the river bank , instead of going back to the Yellow Spa .
I have looked forward to the race together with the rest of the Rungo.cz team , but I tried to enjoy it a little from the other side .
Everyone of us on the team decided to say hello to your readers in person at a stand , where we took photos and filmed videos .
In order to perfect view from the other side , I accepted the role of personal guide .
Together with my friend Káťou , we humbly lined up at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start .
We said hello to our friends , who were walking around us to the sector for faster runners .
There was not much time left .
A couple of jumps to warm up , switching on sport testers , countdown and start !
Cries of jubilation , but instead of the quick start it was followed by rushing to the starting line .
After five minutes , we reach the gate , switch on our meters and run with a pace for the tenth hour .
We become interwoven with the yellow stretch of runners , who like Káťou are running their first race .
So far everyone looks refreshed , and the gradually setting sun on the horizon provides a view of Vyšehrad that nearly takes everyone &apos;s breath away .
The pulsing mass running along the river bank makes it look like all of Prague is running .
On the bank between Vyšehrad and the National Theater , as usual , it becomes apparent who has how much strength .
The slight hill on Palackého Square forces many runners to slow down or switch to walking .
Just before entering Divadelní Street , I see the police accompaniment , and behind them Vítek Pavlišta , sprinting towards finish at an incredible pace .
I hear the other runners catching their breath .
I move to the edge of the route and cheer him on , and he begins to high-five me , but just before that my leg bends , and our hands slightly miss each other .
The run down Divadelní Street presents a chance for a brief rest and catching of breath .
It is necessary , because there are places ahead of us where the views are breathtaking .
Turning onto the Mánesově Bridge presents a view of Prague in its full beauty with the setting sun .
I &apos;m not breathing , and my legs are almost carrying me themselves .
After the first refreshment , the moment of truth comes .
While running along the roadway , Káťou trips on the curb and falls forward .
I look to see whether or not she needs help , and I say a series of encouraging words , so that she wo n&apos;t have time to think about the pain .
She gets up , and we continue along Kozí Lane , which is one of the narrowest parts of the route , and in this stage in the race there is no longer such a rush , but it is still necessary to pay close attention to surroundings .
I still do n&apos;t realize that the term `` narrowest place &apos;&apos; will take on its true meaning later .
After the Powder Tower , we are frantically cheered on by tourists and other runners &apos; friends .
I try to high-five with everyone who puts out his hand , and I advise Káťou to do the same , because ten high-fives with fans is like half an energy bar .
It really works , and we speed up again , and although we have fallen quite far behind , the race to catch up has just begun .
We overtake dozens of runners , and when I notice someone especially tired , I try to encourage him with a few words : `` Come on , just a little farther , you can do it ! &apos;&apos;
After the last refreshment break , no one runs ahead of us any more , and we speed up .
So far we have run for an hour and fifteen minutes , and we are adding minutes , so there is nothing to wait for .
The three kilometers to the finish are going to hurt , but it is really necessary to make it .
The sun has almost set already , and the ending day symbolically slowly ends the race .
The last run to the bridge , a turn and then just a straight route to the finish .
The pace at which we are running amazes me , and I wonder where comes from .
`` Come on , we &apos;re going under hour thirteen , let &apos;s do it ! &apos;&apos; I call out .
We try it , we sprint forward , and there is the finish line .
Hour thirteen and six seconds .
Well , what can you do ?
The trainer has set a limit of hour twenty .
So seven minutes under the plan .
That &apos;s a super outcome .
Just past the finish line , Káťou &apos;s legs give way , and I help her to the railing , where she can rest for a while .
She is visibly exhausted , but also visibly happy about her good performance .
After a while , I gradually take her out from the space of the finish line .
The euphoria prevents us from noticing the mad dash to the lockers .
Here , it is obvious that Kozí Lane was not the narrowest place .
That place is here , beyond the finish at the river bank , which is being swarmed by almost 10,000 runners squeezed together .
If anyone does n&apos;t like crowds , then this is not the place for them .
After a while , I too lose my mind and wonder if those beautiful views and the more interesting route than in previous years were worth experiencing what &apos;s happening now .
From my own experience , I know that hosting an event is nothing to laugh at .
When combined with 10,000 people , a rich accompanying program and closure of the entire center of Prague to all traffic , it &apos;s a huge challenge .
This year &apos;s change of route showed the runners many interesting places , which also brought a few really unpleasant surprises .
The excellent atmosphere pumped out of the Yellow Spa found a place among runners and in the race itself .
The organizers around the route and random spectators intensified it at each meter of the route .
During the run through the historic city center , unfortunately there are obstacles that can not be eliminated , but I do n&apos;t consider putting the finish to the huge race in a location where one side is bordered by a wall and the other by a river to be the best solution .
If I were to say that the race ended when the runners ran to the finish , then I would evaluate it as very successful .
Beyond the route , I was a little afraid for the health of the participants , but in the end everything turned out well .
Please write to us in the discussion forum whether you liked the route and what your thoughts are about the situation with the finish point .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prison Officers Stage National Protest
Hundreds of prison workers from across Bulgaria have held a national protest in front the Justice Ministry in the capital Sofia .
In a peaceful demonstration , they have reiterated their calls for the old working conditions , which were recently changed , to be restored .
Higher salaries are also among a list of requests due to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov .
For a month , officers have protested symbolically against the new working hours , demanding to return to the old 24 hour shifts .
Despite the meetings between the prison officers union and the Justice Ministry representatives , an agreement was not reached , Bulgarian National Radio -LRB- BNR -RRB- informs .
Negotiations are ongoing , the head of the Chief Directorate on the Execution of Penalties Rosen Zhelyazkov told BNR .
The protest of the prison workers union is expected to be joined by members of the Trade Union Federation of the Employees in the Ministry of Interior .
Why can the universe have multiple dimensions and we ca n&apos;t see them ?
Physicists do n&apos;t often write best sellers , but Brian Green from Columbia University managed to hit the bull &apos;s eye in 1999 .
His book , `` The Elegant Universe , &apos;&apos; has become for members of the general public the easiest way to delve into issues being addressed today by several theoretical physicists , an effort to unite two excellently functioning , but mutually incompatible , discoveries of the 20th century , quantum theory and the theory of general relativity .
One of the causes of the success of `` The Elegant Universe &apos;&apos; is undoubtedly that when searching for united physical theories , it &apos;s not a boring story .
Physicists have addressed the basic problem between two key theories -LRB- after all , at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws -RRB- and are resolving it so well that it &apos;s worth it even to explain it to ordinary people .
Greene even coped so well with the difficult material , that he ca n&apos;t be criticized for how much interesting information he did n&apos;t include in his book .
Furthermore , he has mostly made up for his `` mistake &apos;&apos; in another two books : `` The Structure of the Universe &apos;&apos; and `` The Hidden Reality . &apos;&apos;
The author obviously would not even object if his book became obsolete more quickly , but it &apos;s a fact that even after 15 years `` The Elegant Universe &apos;&apos; continues to provide almost everything important that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics .
It is relatively likely that in the years to come the situation in this area will be somewhat more lively -LRB- for example , since the LHC accelerator will finally run on `` full gas &apos;&apos; -RRB- , and so this is a good opportunity to enter the world of modern physics through doors opened up by Greene without force .
How many dimensions could our universe have ?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions certainly could seem far-fetched , strange or mystical .
Nonetheless , it is specific and entirely acceptable .
In order for us to understand it , let &apos;s shift our vision for a moment from the universe as a whole to something more down to earth , specifically a long and thin basic garden hose .
Imagine stretching a 100-meter garden hose from one side of a canyon to another and monitoring the entire scenery from a distance of half a kilometer away -LRB- like in the image on the following page -RRB- .
From such a distance , you can easily recognize a long hose stretched in a horizontal direction , but if you happen to suffer from perspicacity , then you will have difficulty figuring out the thickness of the hose .
Because of your long distance from the hose , you would think that an ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk : a left-right dimension along the hose .
When someone asks you where the ant is at a particular moment , you can respond to him with only one detail : the ant &apos;s distance from the left -LRB- or right -RRB- end of the hose .
All that we want to say here is that from a half-kilometer distance a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object .
In the real world , the hose has thickness .
If we enlarge everything , we will suddenly see a second dimension , in the shape of a ring wrapping around the hose .
In such an enlarged view , it is obvious that the ant in reality could move in two independent dimensions : in the already well known left-right dimensions along the length of the hose , but also in `` a clockwise or counterclockwise direction , &apos;&apos; meaning around the circular cross-section of the hose .
You will start to understand that in order to determine the position of the small ant , you have to enter two numbers : how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the ring wrapping around the hose .
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional . -LRB- Note : Experts point out that this chapter focuses purely on the rupture theory of strings .
The non-rupturing aspects are addressed in chapters 12 and 13 . -RRB-
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional : one long parallel dimension is illustrated by a direct arrow , a dimension in the direction of the perimeter , indicated by a circular arrow , is short and coiled .
Nonetheless , there is a clear difference between these two dimensions .
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible .
The dimension wrapping the perimeter of the hose is short , coiled and harder to recognize .
In order for us to realize the existence of the circular dimension , we had to examine a hose with much better characteristics .
The mentioned example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions .
That it is divided into two groups .
They can be either large , extensive and therefore not directly obvious , or they can be small , coiled and much harder to observe .
Of course , in the specified case we did not exactly re-rub in order to uncover the coiled dimension wrapping the thickness of the hose .
It was enough to pick up a telescope for help .
But if the hose were thinner , like a piece of hair or a capillary , we could uncover the coiled dimension only with great effort .
In 1919 , Kaluza sent Einstein his article , in which he toiled with a huge thought , that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three of the dimensions that we know .
Kaluza explained his radical claim by pointing out that an additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework , in which Einstein &apos;s general relativity and Maxwell &apos;s electromagnetic theory could be combined into one unified concept .
This immediately gives rise the question of how this discovery by Kaluza goes together with the obvious fact that we see three dimensions of space .
The answer that Kaluza predicted quietly between the lines , and which was clearly expressed and clarified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926 , rests and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe could have both large and coiled dimensions .
That means that just like the dimension in the direction of the length of the hose , our universe too has a large , extensive and easily visible set of three dimensions , the existence of which we realize at every moment .
But analogically to the circumference of a garden hose , the universe too can have additional dimensions , firmly coiled into space with it not obvious that until now they have remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatuses .
In order to get a clearer idea of the basis of Kaluza &apos;s noteworthy proposal , let &apos;s continue focusing on that hose for a while .
Imagine that on the circumference of the hose we draw a relatively thick row of rings in black color .
From a distance , the hose still appears as a thin one-dimensional line .
Now with a telescope , thanks to drawing , we can uncover a coiled dimension even more easily , as shown in figure 2 .
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional , with one dimension that is large and almost unlimited , and with another short one and a ring .
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure , but besides one small circular dimension it has three large spatial dimensions , meaning together four spatial dimensions .
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions .
In order to help our imagination a little , we should notice the illustration in figure 3 ; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension .
In the image we can enlarge the view of the geometry of the space in a way similar to how we enlarged the surface of the hose .
Each of the following levels represents a major enlargement of the geometry of the space from the previous level .
Our universe can have additional dimensions -LRB- we see them in the fourth level of enlargement -RRB- , if they are coiled into a sufficiently small space ; this is how we explain that we have not observed them directly so far .
The grid illustrates the well known `` large &apos;&apos; dimension , while the ring illustrates the new , small and coiled dimension .
Just like loops of thread in a thick carpet , these rings too exist in every place with usual dimensions , but for illustration we have sketched them only in interwoven patterns in a grid .
The background of figure 4 illustrates the well known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in typical measuring units , such as meters , illustrated with the side of a small square in a grid .
On each subsequent image , we will focus on the small area of the previous image ; we will enlarge it so that it becomes visible .
From the beginning , nothing special happens , as we can see in several of the first levels of enlargement .
But when we move further along our path to discover the microscopic properties of the geometry of space - to the fourth level of enlargement in figure 3 - then we will suddenly encounter a new dimension coiled in a ring shape , similar to loops of thread in a thick piece woven piece of carpet .
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions similar to that of circumference of a hose along each point of its length .
For illustrative purposes , we have drawn the circular dimension only in certain regularly placed points .
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluza &apos;s and Klein &apos;s idea about the microscopic structure of geometry of space .
The similarity to the hose is obvious , but we can even notice some important differences .
First , the universe has three large spatial dimensions far sprawling from each other -LRB- of which we have drawn only two -RRB- , and only hose has a large dimension .
An even more important difference is that now we are talking about spatial geometry of the universe itself , not about any object within the universe , such as our hose .
But the basic idea is the same .
If the additional circularly coiled dimension is extremely miniature , it can be recognized , just like the round circumference of the host , much more difficultly than observing obvious , large and extensive dimensions .
If the size of an additional dimension is sufficiently small , uncovering it will in fact be beyond the capabilities of our most modern enlargement tools .
However , the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not a mere round protuberance inside regular dimensions , as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously indicates .
The circular dimension is a new dimension , which exists in every point of three regular extensive dimensions .
It is a dimension that is independent of the remaining three dimensions , just as the top-bottom , left-right and front-back dimensions are mutually independent -LRB- and diagonal -RRB- .
A small enough ant could move in all four dimensions , and in order to determine its position we would need four pieces of information , besides the three usual details also the position in the circular dimension ; if we figure in time as well , then there are five details , but in any case it there is one more than we would normally expect .

The price of the e-book version is CZK 149 .
Much to our surprise , we are finding out that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space , Kaluza &apos;s and Klein &apos;s considerations show that the existence of additional coiled dimensions can not be ruled out , if they are small enough .
The universe could even have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye .
How small should they be ?
The most modern technical equipment can recognize the structure of a billionth of a billionth of a meter .
We rarely can observe smaller coiled dimensions .
In 1926 , Klein combined Kaluza &apos;s original idea with a few ideas from quantum mechanics , a subject which was becoming known at the time .
His calculations indicated that an additional circular dimension could have the size of approximately one Planck length , a size far beyond the recognition capabilities of today &apos;s machines .
Since then , the physicists have referred to the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions as the Kaluza-Klein Theory .

The overall basis of the `` 12 &apos;&apos; is the 12-tactic harmonic form , which you can repeat randomly .
Whoever delves into musical theory will find its principle explained in detail here .
Jan Homola , or Honza Homolka Tobolka -LRB- 1976 -RRB-
This trained puppeteer and string puppet master , whose Facebook profile can be viewed here , has been living as a graphic artist since graduating from high school twelve years ago .
He is a guitarist in the band Wohnout , which it is reportedly impossible to quit .
By becoming a guitarist , he has followed in his father &apos;s footsteps , just like is brother Matěj , the leader of Wohnout .
You can begin with training on one string .
`` They rhythmic model is up to you , and you can think up anything and then simply apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve , &apos;&apos; advises Honza .
When you add another string , you can then change the figure again .
It &apos;s enough just to listen to and what Honza , what can be thought up with the twelve-member harmony on two strings and how nice it is beginning to sound .
If you take the third string , you can already flirt with the melody of a certain song .
And when you finally add the fourth , be attentive to changes in tuning , Honza explains in the video .
Then Honza returns to the pentatonic , and you can try to put it together with the twelve-member group .
So practice it diligently .
You can read about how best to do so in the interview with Jan Homola during the first lesson of his electric-guitar-playing school .
Another goal without waiting ?
It &apos;s not anything to celebrate a lot about , admits Hradec player Dvořák .
We will accept a point , and we are happy for it .
During the first half , the other home team , had more chances , &apos;&apos; recalls the offensive player , who this time scored from a penalty kick .
Were n&apos;t you nervous when playing it , since , after all there was a lot of booing ?
I did n&apos;t really notice it much , even though at the other goal , there the hometown fans site , it was probably worse .
After half an hour you made up for the penalty , but you also got the goal out of the penalty in just under four minutes .
What happened ?
We slept through the beginning , we were passive , and this led to a corner and then a penalty .
After that , you rose , and during the first half you were still a better team that had more chances .
Why did that change after the break ?
It &apos;s difficult to say .
I agree that after achieving the goal , we played well until the break .
In the cabin , we said we wanted to sustain the pace of the game after it , but we did not achieve that .
To be honest , I ca n&apos;t even explain why .
It &apos;s probably also true that the home team players said something to each other about their game during the break , and they probably were not satisfied with it .
You first scored on your rival &apos;s field , while at home you have n&apos;t yet gotten even one goal .
Why such a difference ?
I would n&apos;t say that it &apos;s such a difference , but it depends on how we battle .
We began well in Brno , but it went downhill for us from then , and Plzeň is an entirely different category .
For four games you waited for a goal , but were you afraid that it could end up the same after the last game ?
Well , I do n&apos;t think so , but we are understandably happy that since the last game we have not had to listen to talk about waiting for a goal .
Now we have added another without waiting , but there are still only three in six games , which is not yet much to celebrate about .
Iceland - lava flows from a crater kilometers away .
Lava bubbling to the surface in the Holuhraun region , near the Vatnajökull glacier , is flowing through an underground tunnel from a crater kilometers away .
It is located beneath a glacier , like part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel .
This situation is now unsettling scientists the most .
However , so far the situation remains unchanged .
Since yesterday morning -LRB- August 31
2014 -RRB- about the same amount of lava has been erupting from the top of the volcano .
However , despite original estimates , its amount is lower than 1,000 m3 , but `` only &apos;&apos; 300-400 m3 .
Compared to the previous eruption from August 29
2014 , it is 50x greater .
However , scientists are worried that the lava tunnel could open up in places where it is below ice .
If that happened , furthermore with intensity similar to that of the current eruption , it would result in major flooding , both at the Jökulsá á Fjöllum River and at other rivers .
In the surroundings of the eruption , there is a strong smell of sulfur , and gases and steam are rising from the top .
This certainly is not an eruption suitable for tourism , as was the case with the eruption at Fimmvörðuháls in 2010 .
`` This one is much larger , and there are also a lot more gases , &apos;&apos; says volcano expert Ármann Höskuldsson .
However , since yesterday the weather has greatly improved , and in the morning it was almost calm in the area .
The traces of the sandstorm have been washed away by rain .
The scientists can continue in their work .
Orange level -LRB- the second highest -RRB- applies for aviation for Bárðarbungu and yellow -LRB- third -RRB- for Askju .
The skies above Cheb belonged to courageous Lady Peggy .
She went through with her wings .
Aviation day in Cheb .
Aviation acrobat Peggy Walentin has performed on a Boeing Stearman PT-17 , and during the flight she climbed out of the cockpit and made her way to the rack on the top wing of the biplane as well as between the wings .
There she is only at the mercy of the strength of her muscles .
Aviation Day in Cheb was held this year for the fifth in a row , and the organizers again managed to prepare several interesting air performances .
The premiere at the event at the oldest Czech airport was not only `` the walk on wings &apos;&apos; by German aviation acrobat Peggy Walentin , but also featured the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter plane and the Beechcraft 18 aircraft .
It drew attention to itself with its bright coating .
The acrobatic practice known as Wingwalking originates from the United States .
After the First World War , many former war pilots attempted it .
However , because of the large number of fatal injuries , it was banned .
Today it is slowly returning to the agenda of air show .
`` After the start , Peggy climbs out of the cockpit and onto the top wing .
There she demonstrates different exercises .
Near the end of the performance , she moves to the space between the aircraft &apos;s wings , where her show continues , &apos;&apos; explained Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club , the organizer of Aviation Day .
Walentin &apos;s husband Friedrich is the pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E .
If Peggy &apos;s performance was the main attraction of the program , then the demonstration of the Mustang fighter plane was the cherry on the cake .
The legendary fighter plane was accompanied by Grippens from the Czech Air Force -LRB- in numbers -RRB- .
This was the first time aviation fans have been able to see such a joint performance in the Czech Republic .
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then performed breathtaking acrobatics for everyone with a plane from 1945 .
The plane was manufactured during the war , it was probably never used .
It was assigned to the army reserves .
Since 1963 it has served in the civil sphere .
And also as a racing plane .
Today it has its home hangar at the airport in Mnichově Hradišti .
In the same location there is another pearl of the Cheb Aviation Day , the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor .
The enormous aircraft can not be overlooked at the airport .
Its polished aluminum coating shines a long distance .
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard plane in the colors of the French Air Force has also received admiration .
The small airliner got behind the renounced Turbolet , and from Hof , Germany , it brought home part of the German delegation at the air show .
Cheb &apos;s neighbors from the German side of the border gave performances including some with reconstructed Jak 18T aircraft and three-member formations using Bücker Jungmann biplanes .
Lucie Borhyová : A dramatic return to the camera !
Lucie Borhyová has exchanged parental responsibilities for work at least for this evening .
Stress and nervousness are two things the blonde news anchor evidently does not know at all .
Anchoring television news has been going as well for her as if she had not even taken a break from it for two months at all !
It &apos;s been only two weeks since the blonde finished the six weeks during which women experience the most stress after childbirth .
However , Lucie will not yet regularly appear on TV Nova &apos;s main news broadcasts .
According to Blesk.cz , she is not expected to make a regular return to work until a month from now .
After all , her daughter Linda now needs her more than television viewers .
Lucie Borhyová has returned to the TV screen , and it was a bull &apos;s eye .
Exhibition in Prague in a year ?
The arena would be sold out , according to Jágr &apos;s planned going away party .
`` It would be noble if something like this were done during the World Championship .
But it will depend on what position the association takes , &apos;&apos; he said in Jihlava following the Golden Match exhibition , during which the impressive team from the Nagano Olympics met again .
This included players who participated in the golden hat trick .
The players would be in the mood , would n&apos;t they ?
Certainly .
In short , it would be good to have a parting celebration with the golden generation during the championship .
I believe that during the tournament we can find one or two days when everyone will be completely free and a location where everyone could meet for such a match .
I &apos;ll tell Guma -LRB- Jiřímu Šlégrovi -RRB- or Béďovi Ščerbanovi -LRB- the organizer of the Jihlava match -RRB- , would could take responsibility for it ...
The arena would be sold out .
But what if you &apos;re going to participate in the New Jersey play-off ?
Then I &apos;ll fly in ...
But do you not want to play on the team ?
Or has the Jihlava match somehow changed your mind ?
The team and exhibition matches are two different things , and performance is decisive in the team .
The only thing is that people would like to see me there , but performance is decisive , especially for the World Championship .
It should be participated in by players who have what it takes , not because they have a good reputation .
My decision has not changed at all .
How did you enjoy the Nagano reunion ?
Just meeting with the players was great .
Each person recalled events and had a lot of fun .
It was a great experience both for fans and for us hockey players .
Of course , the most important part was honoring Ivan Hlinka .
And it &apos;s good to remind everyone of the history of our hockey , since one generation is leaving who really cared about it .
Slavomír Lener , Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench .
Do you yourself still remember your first team match ?
Such things are impossible to forget .
It was against the Calgary Flames , and there were three young people , Robert Holík , Robert Reichel and I , and we joined in one group of three .
It was the first team start for everyone .
But it would be inaccurate to say that we dominated in any way .
Dominik Hašek played the goal position in Jihlava after a long period .
What did you say about his performance ?
Hašan never surprises me on the ice .
I wanted to give it back to him with criticism , but I can&apos;t . -LRB- Hašek criticized Jágra for the reasons why he decided to quit the team . -RRB- He played the goal position excellently .
Hnilička performed great too .
This was even though he trained with me at night once , and he had shortcomings .
Now he played the goal position fantastically .
First the USA , then the Netherlands ; soccer qualification begins
Prominent guests will arrive at the NH Hotel in Smíchovský on late Monday morning .
People will be able to view celebrities including Petr Čech from Chelsea , team coach Pavel Vrba and others .
And that figure in the black jersey is Tomáš Rosický !
Arsenal &apos;s reserve player and team captain arrived at the gathering at around 11 : 30 a.m. and was one of the last to do so .
`` We can await a nice game against the Netherlands .
Who would not look forward to it ? &apos;&apos; he said when he appeared before reporters in his team uniform .
Czech team &apos;s program
Monday , September 1 : meeting start , first training
Tuesday , September 2 : Open training for fans -LRB- 6 : 30 p.m. , Letná -RRB- Autograph signing -LRB- 8 : 00 p.m . -RRB-
Wednesday , September 3 : Czech Republic - USA -LRB- 8 : 15 p.m. , Letná -RRB-
Tuesday , September 9 : Czech Republic - Netherlands -LRB- 8 : 45 p.m. , Letná -RRB- , end of meeting
Rosický and his associates can be supported by fans already before the Wednesday game against the USA -LRB- 8 : 15 p.m. -RRB- .
The team has opened Tuesday training for them , which will start at Letná at 6 : 30 p.m .
It will be followed by autograph signing , at which neither Rosický nor Čech will be missing .
Otherwise , of course , this meeting of the national team will be calmer .
This has been praised by coach Vrba , who in the spring complained about the number of community events .
We will finally be able to devote our attention to what we want to devote it to .
Now we will focus on the Netherlands .
There is an advantage when you have players together for eight days .
We will have time to practice things that so far we have not had enough time for , &apos;&apos; said Vrba , who has headed the national team since January .
When entering the new qualification cycle , the Czech soccer team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image .
The team under Vrba &apos;s leadership has three games behind it , all of them preparatory matches .
It tied with Norway and Finland 2 : 2 and lost to Austria 1 : 2 .
However , those results were not important any more .
Only now .
With the match with the Netherlands , the qualification is beginning for advancement to the 2016 European Championship .
Of course , the Czech men &apos;s team would be aided if it managed the rehearsal game against the USA .
`` The first year was for us to get to know each other .
Now results are important .
We have to think about how we can be successful , &apos;&apos; said Vrba .
The only player in the 23-member nomination who has health problems is David Lafata .
He suffers from a fever .
If he does n&apos;t manage to recover by the Wednesday game against the USA , coach Vrba could call up one more offensive player .
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she spent many years thinking she was going to die after a misdiagnosis .
Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage life believing that she only had years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease .
She actually had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease -LRB- CMT -RRB- - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine .
Charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition .
About 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have CMT , which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness , an awkward gait and curled toes .
Sufferers can also experience numbness or pain and the condition is incurable and progressive , meaning symptoms get worse over time .
When Rodgers was 13 she was under the impression that she suffered from Friedreich &apos;s ataxia -LRB- FA -RRB- - a condition which had a very poor prognosis .
Rodgers thought that she was going to be wheelchair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she reached her 30s .
The mother-of-two , who is now 51 , said : `` As a child I knew I could n&apos;t do the same things as others .
I was falling daily and everything took me longer to do .
I could never roller-skate or skateboard with other kids and got bullied at school a lot because of the way I walked and ran .
Rodgers said when she was aged 13 , after several operations to release her Achilles tendons and straighten out her feet , she took a peak at her medical notes when her consultant left the room which said that she suffered from FA .
`` I felt guilty because I &apos;d been nosy and so I did n&apos;t tell anybody , but I did come home , look up the condition at the library and wrote to the FA Association , &apos;&apos; she said .
When I got the information back I was gobsmacked and in the worst state of panic possible .
I thought I &apos;d be in a wheelchair at 18 and dead by the time I was 25 and in between gradually lose all my ability .
I was going through this on my own and I planned my own funeral .
She said by the time she reached 17 she realised that her walking abilities had n&apos;t deteriorated as much as she thought they would have and asked her surgeon about it .
He just stood up and hugged me and said ` my dear I do n&apos;t think you have it , as you would be in a wheelchair now . &apos;
I think you have something a lot less life threatening .
After some genetic testing she was found to have CMT .
`` When he explained what CMT was , I thought I &apos;d drawn the lucky straw , &apos;&apos; she said .
Charity CMT UK has launched CMT awareness month to try to draw attention to the condition .
Washington-area business owners &apos;&apos; tax burden mounts as economy rebounds
A rebounding economy means more customers , higher sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local tax bills for companies across the country grew modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated , according to new research released last week , and Washington-area firms were no exception .
District , Maryland and Virginia businesses collectively paid $ 27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013 , an increase of 3.8 percent over the $ 26.6 billion collected in 2012 .
Businesses &apos;&apos; state and local tax burdens last year expanded by 4.3 percent , to $ 671 billion , compared with 3.9 percent the year before , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after back-to-back years of shrinking bills in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes rose at a faster clip , 4.3 percent , than local levies , 3.9 percent , according to the study , which was conducted by professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young and the Center on State Taxation , a tax policy group .
More than half of the District &apos;s tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from business taxes , while 36 percent of Maryland &apos;s revenue comes from firms .
Virginia , at 28 percent , generates the least amount of tax revenue , proportionately , from business .
Much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a rebound in companies &apos;&apos; real estate values , researchers say , which pushed property taxes up 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of sub-1 percent growth .
While a large share of those gains came from big states such as California , New York and Texas , it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia collectively forked over $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year , up from $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - year-over-year growth of 4.2 percent .
But the apparent bounceback in property values is n&apos;t doing nearly as much to inflate state and local tax revenues in Maryland , where property taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of companies &apos;&apos; tax bills .
Virginia and D.C. firms pay nearly half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes .
`` What &apos;s happening in Maryland is that so much of their property , especially the tax base surrounding the D.C. area , is owned either by the government or by nonprofits , which do n&apos;t pay property taxes , &apos;&apos; said Douglas Lindholm , executive director of the Center on State Taxation .
So Maryland is forced to rely much more heavily on , for example , its income taxes to pay for the same services you have in other states .
The recent rebound in business tax revenue can not all be attributed to the recovering real estate market .
Business incomes also appear to be on the mend , according to the data .
Companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $ 2.3 billion , up from $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland collected $ 1 billion in corporate income tax revenue , the most in the region .
While trending in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses is n&apos;t growing at the same pace in all three places .
The District &apos;s rate of growth was level with the national average , at 4.3 percent , while Maryland &apos;s growth was substantially faster at 4.9 percent .
Only Virginia posted a below-average tax bill bump of 4.1 percent .
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax by far of the three jurisdictions -LRB- all of which have flat corporate rates -RRB- at 6 percent .
Maryland &apos;s corporate rate is 8.25 percent , while the District &apos;s stands at a relatively high 9.975 percent .
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia had lower state and local business taxes and an overall better business tax climate than Maryland .
The District was n&apos;t evaluated in the study .
Despite its advantage , Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south .
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering its corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent , in line with Virginia , and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year .
If the state continues to meet revenue goals in the coming year , the law could push the state &apos;s business income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 2017 .
Meanwhile , small businesses in the Washington region seem to be faring better and thus paying more state and local taxes , according to the recent study .
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - the pass-through structure by which most small firms are organized - in the District , Maryland and Virginia surged 20 percent last year to $ 2.4 billion , a much faster rate of growth than overall business taxes .
Researchers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nationwide are likely to continue this year , with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year .
However , the Washington area may lag behind as the slowdown in federal spending takes its toll on the region &apos;s labor market .
What you missed : Tusk to head Europe , Putin &apos;s Novorossiya and Lafata &apos;s scissors
Will a new state emerge in Ukraine ?
Putin calls for negotiations about Novorossiya
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeast Ukraine , where since April government forces have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels .
He has also warned European companies that now that sanctions have been imposed against Russia , it will be difficult for them to return to the Russian market .
He says the support provided by the West to the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine conflicts with democratic values .
He says when the conflict will end will depend on Kiev , and so he can not say when the Ukrainian crisis will end .
More sanctions for Russia ?
The Czech Republic has reserved the right to disagree with parts of the sanctions .
The European Commission , together with diplomats , will propose within a week what form the next round of sanctions against Russia will take , it decided at the EU summit overnight .
This was told to reporters by Herman Van Rompuy , the permanent chairman of meetings attended by member states .
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka , the specific proposals for shifting the form of sanctions should be prepared already on Monday .
Tusk will be the new EU `` president . &apos;&apos;
He will replace Van Rompuy in December .
At the EU summit , Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected chairman of the European Council , and is therefore the `` EU president , &apos;&apos; who oversees top meetings attended by member states &apos; representatives .
As of December , he is replacing Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years .
Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini is replacing Catherine Ashton as the top EU diplomat .
The Italian , who will become deputy chairwoman of the future European Commission , still needs to be confirmed in the European Parliament before she can take over the position .
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic that no one talks about .
Can a patient with a long-term or untreatable disease be helped end their life ?
Not legally in the Czech Republic , since laws here do not permit euthanasia .
Nonetheless , some physicians contacted by LN say they have received such requests .
ALS : The most difficult chapter of neurology , a physician says about sclerosis
The Czech Republic has about 300 people suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- ALS -RRB- , and 21 patients are undergoing experimental stem-cell treatment at Prague &apos;s Motol Hospital .
`` We do n&apos;t know for sure whether it will be successful .
But if we do n&apos;t try it , then we wo n&apos;t find out , &apos;&apos; says Radim Mazanec , a Motol neurologist .
This has the hallmarks of a CIA plot , since they needed a war , Huml writes about downed flight MH17 .
Czech Social Democratic MP Stanislav Huml is clearly convinced of who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine .
According to him , it is clear that the `` tough sanctions that were announced in relation to the downing of the civilian aircraft with more than 300 dead was caused intentionally by the Ukrainian army . &apos;&apos;
According to the lawmaker , it also has the hallmarks of a CIA plot .
Promises that can not be kept .
The elections are coming , and the parties are again offering even the impossible .
The end of homeless people on the streets , parking for every family and a cable car above Prague .
This is repeated every year : the parties promise the impossible .
Also now , with the coming municipal elections , politicians are exaggerating to impress voters more .
Lidovky.cz has put together a list of impossible to fulfill promises from the past and present .
70 years ago Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkerque .
This began a fierce siege .
It was 30 August 1944 when the independent Czechoslovak brigade moved to France .
Its commander , Alois Liška , properly requested replenishment of technical equipment and its sending to the front .
The British side eventually satisfied that request , and included the ground force as one of its own when overrunning the port city of Dunkerque , which had remained under the control of German troops .
SUMMARY : Plzeň leads the league ahead of the Prague `` S , &apos;&apos; Liberec crushes Baník .
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the soccer league , which it is leading a point ahead of both Prague `` S &apos;&apos; teams .
The changed situation is the result of a defeat of Slavie 1 : 2 in Mladé Boleslav .
After two defeats , Sparta recovered in the home league , and thanks to two interventions by Lafata it beat Jablonec .
Liberec enjoyed a record win , beating Baník Ostrava 6 : 0 .
62,000 spectators for volleyball ?
The Poles say yes .
The introduction to the Volleyball World Championship in Warsaw brought a record number of spectators .
At the soccer stadium under the pulled roof , 62,000 people watched the home team &apos;s easy win over Serbia .
The tickets were sold out in 100 minutes .

Joan Rivers &apos; Family Keeping ` Our Fingers Crossed &apos;
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her arrival three days ago at a New York City hospital , but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness .
`` Thank you for your continued love and support , &apos;&apos; Melissa Rivers said in a statement today .
We are keeping our fingers crossed .
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital Thursday after an emergency call that she was in cardiac arrest at an Upper East Side clinic , Yorkville Endoscopy , sources said .
Doctors are intentionally keeping her sedated and under close supervision until they &apos;re more comfortable with her condition , which remains `` serious . &apos;&apos;
Reaction has been widespread , including overwhelming online support from the likes of Donald Trump , Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa .
Reality is distorted by headlines
The fact that media organizations distort reality with their headlines is -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- nothing new .
I know that headlines `` sell &apos;&apos; newspapers , but unfortunately I also know that there are a lot of so-called `` readers &apos;&apos; who do n&apos;t read anything .
And it &apos;s a fact that has really bothered me recently , or , better put , infuriates me .
It has to do with , for example , articles about the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip .
Headlines such as `` Israel attacks Gaza &apos;&apos; are entirely common .
First you read in the text that the Israeli `` attack &apos;&apos; was a reaction to rockets being fired from Gaza , often during the declared ceasefire .
Then you get to a headline that says `` Both sides violate ceasefire . &apos;&apos;
Does the journalistic profession realize that with their approach they are directly contributing to anti-Semitic sentiment , which is growing all over Europe -LRB- and not only there -RRB- .
It has n&apos;t been even sixty years since the end of the Second World War .
There are still people alive who survived the Holocaust .
When I saw a video from the Federal Republic of Germany , where a crowd was shouting things like `` Jewish swine &apos;&apos; and similar despicable phrases , it struck me .
Does the world want to finish what Hitler did n&apos;t manage to ?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews , the Slavs were targeted for liquidation ?
Ladies and Gentlemen in the journalist profession , please be a bit more careful in your work .
You are often referred to as `` watchdogs of democracy . &apos;&apos;
So enhance that .
While it &apos;s still here .
And also promote the right of the only truly democratic country in the Middle East to defend its population .
How would you want our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided that it wanted to liquidate the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the world &apos;s map ?
Maybe you should realize one more fact .
Nearly 20 % of the Arabs on Israel &apos;s territory have Israeli citizenship .
And they feel good there .
When you ask them why they do n&apos;t go to be among `` their own , &apos;&apos; for example to Gaza , they will ask you why they should .
In Israel , they have work , social certainties and top quality health care -LRB- I have seen with my own eyes how Arabs too go to the top quality Hadassa hospital , which is financed from sponsorship donations from Jews around the world , and those Arabs are understandably treated there -RRB- .
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its rockets .
The only true way of helping Gaza , and the tense region , is to remove and disarm Hamas .
And not to condemn Israel , even if only indirectly through headlines .
Get informed about Hamas &apos; practices and its use of people as human shields .
Get informed that Hamas &apos; goal is to liquidate the State of Israel at any cost .
Even if it causes the death of innocent Arab children .
Get informed that Hamas is on the list of global terrorist organizations .
Get informed that in the nine years of self-governance in Gaza , it could have blossomed thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world .
Even from Israel , which supplies water and electricity , for which of course the rulers of Gaza do n&apos;t pay , and then they even get upset when power supplies are sometimes interrupted .
If Hamas did not invest its money into constructing underground tunnels to enable suicide bombers to penetrate into Israel , but instead into activities such as construction of residential housing , hospitals and schools , its Arab brothers from Gaza would live much better .
Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what the Information reported Monday morning : The online retailer - and video producer , and a hundred other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $ 1.04 billion -LRB- $ US970 million -RRB- .
The announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected Twitch to be bought , but because YouTube was widely expected to be the buyer .
Three months ago the sale of Twitch to Google &apos;s video service , for a cool billion , looked all wrapped up , and the pairing seemed natural .
Twitch , founded only three years ago as Justin.tv , set out to be a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
Instead , it quickly became a platform for gamers to broadcast their in-game feats ; a `` YouTube for live gaming , &apos;&apos; in Business Insider &apos;s words .
Twitch &apos;s interface .
And `` let &apos;s play , &apos;&apos; a genre of videos in which wiseacres give -LRB- mostly older -RRB- games the Mystery Science Theater treatment , are already popular on YouTube .
The point is , YouTube comes up a lot when describing Twitch , so the news that YouTube was acquiring Twitch was greeted with a yawn , a textbook example of an entrenched tech company buying out a potential competitor .
It &apos;s a mystery why the deal with YouTube fell through , considering it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon .
All we have at the moment is this statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shear : `` We chose Amazon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us get there faster . &apos;&apos;
Another mystery , frankly , is Twitch &apos;s incredible success .
To snobs like me who declare that they &apos;d rather play sports than watch them , it &apos;s hard to see the appeal of watching games rather than taking up a controller myself .
It &apos;s one thing to look over your friend &apos;s shoulder at 3 in the morning as she creeps through Resident Evil , and quite another to watch some rando get 20 headshots in a row in Call of Duty .
All the games you could be watching right now .
Another problem is that many of today &apos;s most popular games are first-person , so watching footage of them , without controlling the viewpoint yourself , can be a Do It Right-worthy recipe for a headache .
I concede that speedruns , in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time , are entertaining .
But unless someone is a virtuoso at gaming or humour , his Twitch channel is n&apos;t likely to be all that interesting .
But what do sceptics like me know ?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors monthly and is the fourth-largest source of peak internet traffic .
How , exactly , will Amazon capitalise on this ?
It &apos;s hard to imagine Twitch being folded into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have just swallowed Twitch .
But Twitch has something any company would love to attract : hordes of advertiser-coveted young men .
As Twitch chief Shear said , Amazon and Twitch `` are both believers in the future of gaming , &apos;&apos; and the medium shows no sign of shrinking , even - gulp - as a spectator sport .
The Second Foundational Falsehood of Creationism .
Another translation into Czech of a writing by American atheist vlogger AronRa .
This time on the topic : `` Scriptures are the Word of God . &apos;&apos;
Original video attached .
The 2nd foundational falsehood of creationism is the belief that sacred scriptures were written by a god rather than by the actual human authors .
When believers argue over any of the many things which contradict their religion , they often challenge us to decide whom we are going to believe .
The alleged `` word &apos;&apos; of God ? Or that of Men ?
As if human inquiry had no chance against the authority they imagine their doctrine to be .
But when they say , `` men , &apos;&apos; they &apos;re talking about science .
And when they refer to the `` word of God , &apos;&apos; they &apos;re talking about myths written about God by men .
If there really is an intelligent and purposeful creator , then it would have to be he who constructed the fossil record revealing evolutionary history , and he has to be the one who conceived the genetic patterns which also trace that same course , and it must have been he who added the other lines of evidence which point to the evolutionary conclusion exclusively and in brilliant detail .
Why else would all these things exist ?
It &apos;s as if he were trying to tell us something !
Men could n&apos;t create any of those things .
But men can tell stories , whoppers in fact .
And it was men who wrote all the scriptures pretending to speak for God .
Every one of the world &apos;s supposedly `` holy &apos;&apos; doctrines of any religion describe themselves as being written by men , not gods .
Men who were `` moved by &apos;&apos; or inspired by their favorite gods , or perhaps taking dictation from angels , but they were written by lowly imaginative yet imperfect mortals none the less ; not by angels , and certainly not by gods .
If there really was one true god , it should be a singular composite of every religion &apos;s gods , an uber-galactic super-genius , and the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos .
If a being of that magnitude ever wrote a book , then there would only be one such document ; one book of God .
It would be dominant everywhere in the world with no predecessors or parallels or alternatives in any language , because mere human authors could n&apos;t possibly compete with it .
And you would n&apos;t need faith to believe it , because it would be consistent with all evidence and demonstrably true , revealing profound morality and wisdom far beyond contemporary human capacity .
It would invariably inspire a unity of common belief for every reader .
If God wrote it , we could expect no less .
But what we see instead is the very opposite of that .
Instead of only one religion leading to one ultimate truth , we have many different religions with no common origin , all constantly sharding into ever more deeply-divided denominations , seeking conflicting truths , and each somehow claiming divine guidance despite their ongoing divergence in every direction .
The Jewish Torah , the Christian gospels , the Qur&apos;an of Islam , the Kitab-i-Aqdas of Bahá&apos;u&apos;lláh , the Hindu Vedas , the Avestas of Zarathustra , the Adi-Granth of the Sikhs , the Mahabarata &apos;s Bhagavad-Gita , the Book of Mormon , and the Urantia book are all declared to be the `` absolute truth &apos;&apos; and the `` revealed word &apos;&apos; of the `` one true &apos;&apos; god , and believers of each say the others are deceived .
The only logical probability is that they all are â € &apos;&apos; at least to some degree .
None of these have any particular advantage over the others .
None of them have any evidentiary support , and none of them are historically verifiable .
`` I &apos;m Dr. Paul Maier , professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University .
I &apos;m not saying that now I have proven the Bible is authoritative , is accurate historically .
Of course not .
You still have to have faith . &apos;&apos;
All of them require faith , and apologetics as well , because they also contain inconsistencies , absurdities , and primitive notions once held true but which have since been disproved .
So they can claim no evidence of divine wisdom .
Many of them promote heinous atrocities in place of morality , and many claim to be validated by prophecies now fulfilled â € &apos;&apos; where each may also contain prophesies which failed to come to pass as predicted .
Leading theologians admit that all of the scriptures of any religion were written by human hands and were thus subject to the interpretations , impressions and perspectives of their primitive and often prejudiced and politically-motivated authors , and they cite this as the explanation behind many of the contradictions in those books , especially those in the Bible .
`` Well I would n&apos;t call them contradictions as much as commentaries , the one on the other .
Again , let &apos;s point out , we probably do have two different authors here who &apos;s work was blended together then in editorial revisioning somewhat . &apos;&apos;
He &apos;s right about there being more than one author for Genesis , and it was definitely not an eyewitness account !
Some experts now recognize four different sources just for the Pentateuch , the five books of `` Moses , &apos;&apos; and they do n&apos;t credit Moses as the author of any of them as he evidently never existed as described .
The scholarly consensus is that Genesis was compiled , -LRB- probably by Ezra -RRB- from several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago .
Other documents filtered in at the same time , all of which attributed to human authors .
The Bible is nowhere near as old as believers say it is !
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological texts known for the still unfinished basis of all of western monotheism , yet they &apos;re each centuries younger than the origins of Zoroastrian , Buddhist , Hindu , Hellenist , Druidic , Chinese and Egyptian religions .
Christianity began with the Gnostic faith , and then the Docetics , and Ebionites , and their completely different perspectives of Jesus were eventually combined into a kind of compromise called Orthodoxy .
Other Christian subsets like the Luciferians were overrun and discredited by further Biblical revisions .
One of these revisions relates to the king of Ugarit around 3,500 years ago .
As his followers were the principle competition with the emerging religion of Moses , scribes working on the New Testament chose to demonize Ba&apos;al ZeBul , the `` Lord on High , &apos;&apos; by distorting his name to Beelzebub , the `` Lord of the Flies . &apos;&apos;
So the Bible has been deliberately and deceptively altered for both religious and political reasons .
The rest of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century in a series of committee decisions at a convention at Nicea .
Four gospels were accepted and sixteen more were rejected , all by a show of hands , as if the facts of the matter could be evaluated or dismissed by popular vote .
`` The way the canon developed was by what was being read on Sunday in the centers of Christianity .
What do you read on the 2nd Sunday after Easter in the church in Jerusalem ?
What &apos;s the church of Rome reading at this time ?
And they found that again and again , they were zeroing in on the same stories in the gospels .
And so the core of the canon kind of developed from the usage of the early church . &apos;&apos;
So the council simply accepted as gospel whatever few relevant stories the uneducated masses happened to like at that time .
But they still opted to remove more than a dozen books from the Bible even though they were still referenced by other books they chose to include .
Among the rejected items were the writings of both apostles and prophets .
Why would God &apos;s word refer us to other books which were some human &apos;s word , and @/@ or are no longer available ?
Who were the real editors here ?
The Bible often names human authors .
But how could it make such an admission if God were the real author and editor of this haphazard jumble of fables , parables , and psalm lyrics ?
The Bible was very definitely written by men , and not superior men either ; far from it !
This is why so much of it can be shown to be historically and scientifically dead wrong about damned-near everything back-to-front .
We &apos;re talking about people who believe snakes and donkeys can talk , who believe in incantations , blood sacrifice , ritual spells , enchanted artifacts , pyrotechnic potions , astrology , and the five elements of witchcraft .
They thought that if you use a magic wand to sprinkle blood all over someone , it will cure them of leprosy .
We &apos;re talking about people who think that rabbits chew cud , and that bats are birds , and whales are fish , and that Pi is a round number .
These folks believed that if you display striped patterns to a pregnant cow , it would bare striped calves .
How could anyone say that who knows anything about genetics ?
Obviously the authors of this book did n&apos;t .
If the Bible had been written by a supreme being , then it would n&apos;t contain the mistakes that it does .
If it was written by a truly superior being , and meant to be read as a literal history , then the Bible would n&apos;t contain anything that it does .
As a moral guide , it utterly fails , because much of the original Hebrew scriptures were written by ignorant and bigoted savages who condoned and promoted animal cruelty , incest , slavery , abuse of slaves , spousal abuse , child abuse , child molestation , abortion , pillage , murder , cannibalism , genocide , and prejudice against race , nationality , religion , sex , and sexual orientation .
To justify their own inhumanity by claiming to do the will of God .
But creationists still continue to ignore all of that .
Some of their sites even admit that wherever reality conflicts with the Bible , then reality must be ignored !
And why is that ?
Because if creationists did n&apos;t have their beloved books , they would n&apos;t have a god either .
One is the other in their world .
Ironically , the faithful reject the `` works &apos;&apos; of God as `` worshipping creation over the creator . &apos;&apos;
But then they prop up the words of men before God , as God , and even insist that disproving their supposedly `` holy &apos;&apos; books would somehow disprove God too .
Not just their version of God , but everyone else &apos;s version of God as well .
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong , then God lied .
They can not accept that God could exist but the Bible be wrong because they ca n&apos;t distinguish doctrine from deity .
So it is a form of idolatry wherein the believers worship man-made compilations as though those books were God himself -because they think it is HIS word .
But God never wrote or dictated any of the scriptures of any religion .
Everything men chose to reject from or include in their supposedly `` inalterable word &apos;&apos; of whatever god was conceived , composed , compiled , translated , interpreted , edited , and often deliberately altered and enhanced by mere fallible men .

An attacker at a Chinese school has stabbed nine people , three of whom have died .
According to the New China agency , the man , named Chen entered an elementary school building by force in the morning and attacked at around 10 : 30 a.m. local time .
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital .
Chen eventually killed himself by jumping from a height , New China reported , citing regional government officials .
China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children in recent years .
Therefore , the public is calling for more security measures and better protection of children in the country , where a lot of married couples have only one child in accordance with the government &apos;s policy .

David Fiala named new TV Nova news art director
David Fiala has become the new art director for TV Nova &apos;s news and current affairs department as of September 1 .
He is replacing Alan Zárubu , who since June 1 has headed the creative department of the entire Nova group .
David Fiala previously worked in the graphics department of news channel Z1 .
In the past two years , under the leadership of Alan Zárubu , he participated in the implementation of a complete visual transformation of the Televizní noviny evening news show , the programs Střepiny , Prásk ! and other current affairs programs at TV Nova .
`` David Fiala is very good at team work and communication among news desks , studio management and the graphics department , which is basically the work of a news art director .
He has a feel for typography and pure elegant design , which is the path we want to stay on for visual production for Nova news , &apos;&apos; says Nova &apos;s creative director Alan Zárubu .
Apple iCloud reportedly hacked , naked celebrity photos leaked
Screenshot with a list of leaked files
A so far anonymous user on the 4chan website has been publishing naked and even pornographic photos of American celebrities , the U.S. website Mashable.com reports .
It reportedly gained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple &apos;s servers , where the affected users had uploaded them via automatic back-ups of images from iPhones and iPads .
Apple has not yet commented about the problem .
Some celebrities are denying the authenticity of the pictures , say they are forgeries , but others have already admitted that they are genuine .
They include actress Jennifer Lawrence , known from the title role of Katniss in the `` Hunger Games &apos;&apos; movie series and Mary Elizabeth Winstead , who has played in movies such as `` Die Hard 4.0 . &apos;&apos;
The hacker &apos;s aim is to use the photos and videos to get rich .
Interest in them has reportedly been expressed by American magazines , but according to report on 4chan , the hacker would rather get money from the community .
According to the website The Next Web , the incident is very likely due to a weakness in security of the iCloud .
Two days ago , a tool reported on the website GitHub , which made it possible to gain passwords to user accounts through brute force , by automatically repeating log-in attempts with various passwords .
That tool provably worked , but Apple patched the hole two days later .
However , it is clear that potential attackers had a lot of time to gain access to various accounts before the tool was made available to the public .
As a preventive precaution , iCloud users should change their Apple ID passwords .
What &apos;s important is the length of the password , not how complex it is .
A good length is at least 12 characters .
The leak of naked photos of celebrities can be considered a reminder of the need to use online services securely .
Although the servers of companies such as Apple , Google and Microsoft are secured much better than computers in homes and small companies , uploading of sensitive photographs in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk .
If you want to back up explicit photos or any sensitive contents online , you should encrypt the files before uploading them .
It also makes sense to set up automatic back-ups from a phone in a way that ensures that they occur only over WiFi and after the phone is connected to a charger .
That way you will be able to move sensitive photos to a `` safe place &apos;&apos; in time , and mainly you will have time to delete bad photos , so they will not unnecessarily take up space in online storage services .
We are offering readers of HN and IHNED.cz a guide explaining how to encrypt files and communication in the form of an e-book by Michal Altair Valáška in PDF format .
Smart ways to save on college textbooks
With the cost of college textbooks surpassing $ 1,000 a year for many students , soon-to-be sophomore Matt Schroeder came up with a smart way to trim costs .
He worked out a system of borrowing books from upperclassmen , offering nominal compensation to get them to delay selling them back .
`` My calculus book that usually costs $ 180 , I got for the semester for $ 10 and a Chick-fil-A biscuit , &apos;&apos; says Schroeder , 19 , who attends Covenant College in Georgia .
Required texts for his last semester would have cost $ 430 , he says .
He spent $ 120 .
The College Board says the average student will spend more than $ 1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies , but students have a variety of options for managing these costs .
Online outlets and creative approaches like Schroeder &apos;s are increasingly the go-to choices for students .
Renting textbooks is on the rise , allowing students to use a book for the semester , often at a significant discount to buying .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 campus bookstores , says textbook rentals have doubled since 2011 .
Industry research shows that about one-fourth of books at college bookstores in this past spring semester were rented , says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer .
Fewer than half of all texts are purchased at campus bookstores , according to the National Association of College Stores trade association .
Here is the 101 on the best ways to score a deal .
Buying online
Some new book prices can be one-third of what you might find at the campus bookstore if you go online .
The ninth edition of `` Calculus &apos;&apos; by Ron Larson , Bruce Edwards , and Robert Hostetler carries a list price of nearly $ 290 but can be purchased new for $ 239.99 at specialty textbook retailer Chegg.com .
Buying used
If you do not mind other people &apos;s notes or wear and tear , used texts are a good option .
`` Calculus &apos;&apos; is selling for $ 93.49 used on Chegg.com .
Matt Casaday , 25 , a senior at Brigham Young University , says he had paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of `` Strategic Media Decisions : Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business . &apos;&apos;
The book was selling for $ 48 new .
Academics like Ingrid Bracey , director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst &apos;s College Without Walls , suggest students check with their professors to see if previous editions are acceptable .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the classwork .
If so , old editions can often be found for a tiny fraction of the cost of the latest version .
Besides Chegg and Amazon , eBay Inc &apos;s Half.com is a popular alternative for used books .
Renting
Renting your textbooks is worth considering if you take reasonable care of them , you remember to return them and you do not care to own them after you complete the class .
You can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of buying a book new .
For example , a student could rent `` Calculus &apos;&apos; for the length of the semester for about $ 20 .
Know the rules of the store you rent from , including any penalties you could be assessed for taking notes , highlighting , or wear and tear .
Renter , beware : If you fail to return the book , penalties can actually exceed the cost of buying it new .
E-books
Getting e-books instead of traditional texts is another option .
Sometimes those books are essentially rented by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distributors such as Amazon.com , Chegg and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc .
Chegg will rent `` Calculus &apos;&apos; for six months for about $ 61 .
Bracey says students in literature classes can often find the best bargains since many classics are now available to download for free , while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive .
No matter what , shop around .
Joe Gault , 29 , who is about to enter Pepperdine Law School , recommends using the ISBN number to price books since it ensures you are shopping for the right text .
Before ordering online , Gault says , be sure to check if the book is actually in stock .
He learned that lesson the hard way .
A book he purchased was back-ordered for four weeks , and he ended up paying full price at the college bookstore .
Mud , nothing but mud .
And then in a well they found the torso of a rifle from the end of the war .
That well is located not far from the Church of St. George .
`` We uncovered the surrounding vegetation and began pulling out an aged deposition , about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves .
When we got close to the clay bottom , we reached a barrel , &apos;&apos; Radomil Novák recalled .
We pulled it out , cleaned it and discovered that it was the torso of a German assault rifle used by SS units .
The finding was reportedly unusual .
`` According to information available to me , these types of rifles were not manufactured until near the end of the war .
And there were about 300,000 of them , &apos;&apos; Novák added .
All items built with wood eventually decompose , and therefore it is not usable .
Of course , its body has been preserved and retains its shape .
How did it end up in the well ?
One explanation exists .
`` Maybe people who needed to get rid of weapons used by the SS threw it in their , probably out of fear of being expelled .
Fascists fleeing certainly did not do it .
They discarded weapons in the forest , &apos;&apos; say the founders .
The rifle was the only thing found in the well by the finders , members of the Jeseníky chapter of Friends of the Earth .
`` There could have been hand grenades there as well , since there used to be a lot of them everywhere around , and therefore we slowed digging work and carefully sifted through the mud , so that nothing unfortunate would happen , but there was nothing else down there , &apos;&apos; Novák said .
The finding will end up in the depository of a museum at a chateau in nearby Slezských Rudolticích .
Ukrainian general : I have not yet freed the captured Czech
An exclusive interview by Aktuálně.cz with General Volodymyr Ruban , who is freeing Ukrainian soldiers from captivity by pro-Russian separatists .
Kiev @/@ Prague - `` Excuse me , I have to pick it up ... they are calling me from Donetsk , &apos;&apos; he said , apologizing perhaps eight times during an exclusive interview conducted by Aktuálně.cz with Ukrainian General Volodymyr Ruban , who is also the director of the local Center for Liberation of Prisoners of War .
General Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate .
During each such interruption , it was not possible to hear the names of the people , their numbers and locations , where they are - or where they should be - which Ruban will clear up with his counterpart on the other end of the phone line .
`` That &apos;s right , go there , &apos;&apos; he said , ending a quick discussion with someone in Donetsk , and then he focused on ours again .
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the reserves , a former fighter plane pilot and was an active participant in the Maidan protests .
Still yesterday , when we arranged our interview , he was in Donetsk .
He devotes himself to freeing Ukrainian soldiers captured by pro-Russian separatists 24 hours a day .
Aktuálně.cz : Perhaps you know that there are also Czechs fighting on the pro-Russian separatists &apos; side .
Our counter-intelligence service estimates that there are up to 30 of them .
But of course , there could be many more .
Have you already encountered any Czech prisoners of war during your negotiations ?
Volodymyr Ruban : I have already freed captured Serbs , Dagestanis , Chechens , one Swede and a Georgian , but not a Czech yet .
But I know whom to turn to in Prague if we encounter one of your countrymen among prisoners of war and how to free him .
A Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz : What advice would you give to Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian soldiers ?
They should understand that if they are fighting as Czechs under Ukrainian banners of volunteers and separatists capture them , then after questioning them they will be shot without a pardon , just like any other foreigner .
The separatists consider these men to be mercenaries , and they say such people do n&apos;t deserve anything other than death .
But if , for example , Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists and there is , for example , a Czech among them , they will put him behind bars and negotiate with him as a prisoner of war .
In short , that man will live .
The Ukrainian side behaves like a country even in war .
A.cz : And how many Ukrainian prisoners of war have you already managed to rescue ?
If I understand well , by exchanging .
Some sources say that the number exceeded a hundred men just recently .
Long ago , we already stopped counting how many people we &apos;ve helped .
We just freed them , we did not rescue them from war if they decided to continue in battles .
The rescuers in a war are doctors , surgeons , but certainly not us .
That is how it was .
And every day there are more and more .
Every day we rescue someone .
Sometimes one person , and sometimes four or five .
And there is n&apos;t always an exchange involved .
Sometimes just a mere human request is enough to gain the release of prisoners .
A.cz : Word has it that in just a few months you have gained a lot of authority in dealings with the pro-Russian separatists and even their trust , just like in Ukrainian society .
How did you manage to earn respect from both warring parties ?
That &apos;s a difficult question .
One of the officers in Kiev has given me the nickname `` the crazy general with steel balls . &apos;&apos;
That does n&apos;t offend me .
But perhaps it highlights the basis of our work .
As the head of the Ukrainian Officers Association , I had already earned certain authority previously .
I never take advantage of people , I never cheat , and I always keep my word .
No matter what &apos;s happening , I act honestly and tell the truth .
I do so even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government or for the representatives in Donetsk or Luhansk .
And if they torture and kill people ?
Then I simply tell them that they are torturing and killing .
And that those are crimes .
At the same time , they often risk their lives , and they even impressed me during prisoner swaps ... this work can be the end for me at any time ... I do n&apos;t have to return to it .
A.cz : How many executions and incidents of torture of prisoners are you aware of ?
... -LRB- long pause -RRB- ... Both Ukrainians and separatists resort to torturing prisoners during questioning .
Unfortunately .
And executions ?
They take place only on the Donetsk side .
I do n&apos;t have any information about the Ukrainian army executing any prisoners .
I do n&apos;t have any information either to suggest that the Ukrainian army would even resort to such a tactic .
We have a guess about the number of executions , but I can neither give you any numbers , nor do I want to .
A.cz : Please describe to me the character among the pro-Russian separatist and their motives .
They include officers and even veterans from Afghanistan .
They are seeking independence and perhaps even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk , or at least they say so .
They no longer want to play their cards with the Ukrainian oligarchs .
The separatists have had enough of the oligarchs an are their unwavering opponents , for life and death .
As we say , they &apos;re up to their necks .
By the way , the same dreams and wishes were expressed by people at the Maidan .
And now there is some speculation : Russia is supporting the separatists , and the West is supporting Ukraine .
I consider one speculation large and the other small .
But just that sentence hides within it an implacable dispute .
A.cz : For example , what &apos;s your impression of one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists , Igor Bezler ?
Whenever I cross the front line , I &apos;m unarmed and raise my bare hands to soldier and rebels .
And both sides always have me within a range of 200 or 300 meters of their sight or optical sensor .
I can always well see the faces of the people who approach me , and they can press the triggers on their weapons at any time .
Paratrooper and experienced colonel of both German and Ukrainian descent .
He considers himself a Russian officer , even though his family -LRB- mother -RRB- lives in Ukraine .
He thinks Ukraine should n&apos;t exist .
And if so , then as a small colony in a vast Russian Empire .
In any case , he keeps talking about it , and he considers Ukraine somehow to be result of a certain misunderstanding .
He says such a state should not exist .
He is also an unwavering enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs .
A.cz : Speaking of characters , in a Ukrainian TV discussion show you described your prime minister , Arseniy Yatsenyuk , as a weak , clueless and tired `` leader &apos;&apos; who would do best if he left quickly .
In walking three meters , I always become scared at least fivefold .
Why should I conceal my opinion that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and is harming our country ?
A.cz : Do you believe he is a participant in the war in Ukraine ?
Perhaps you know that the Ukrainians call Yatsenyuk a `` rabbit . &apos;&apos;
A rabbit in the eyes of Ukrainians is not an animal that would prompt fear or earn respect and authority from others .
His behavior copies the behavior of a rabbit .
Maybe he &apos;s a good economist , but as a prime minister in a war , he does n&apos;t have the right to cry in Parliament , make requests , play with it using his intrigue and threaten to resign.. he has to lead the country , manage it and protected it during the war .
When putting the country at risk , the prime minister is not entitled to a family , friends , rest or crying .
After all , he &apos;s the prime minister of Ukraine .
And Yatsenyuk ?
He behaves like a girl in puberty .
Yes , he &apos;s tired , but he &apos;s also weak , because he has never been strong , and he does n&apos;t fight for Ukraine , he just complains about everything .
Therefore , he should leave .
The sooner he does , the better for Ukraine .
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy could n&apos;t save the box office
Sylvester Stallone &apos;s The Expendables 3 has made back less than $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the US , while Sin City : A Dame to Kill For has made back only $ 12 million of its $ 70 million budget .
The Cameron Diaz vehicle Sex Tape took only $ 14.6 million in its opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as How To Train Your Dragon 2 are also showing disappointing box office returns .
An article from Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that , when it comes to children &apos;s movies , the poor quality of the films themselves might be to blame .
Collin called 2014 the `` the worst &apos;&apos; year yet for children &apos;s films , and described How To Train Your Dragon 2 as a merely `` functional &apos;&apos; fantasy sequel .
But when it comes to film pitched at a slightly older market , it appears that the issue might not necessarily lie with the quality of the films themselves .
In July , Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for every summer release playing on at least 2,000 screens between May &apos;s Memorial Day holiday and July 20 , for 2013 and for this year .
The results , which take the opinion of both cinema audiences and film critics into account , suggest that this year &apos;s crop of films are of similar calibre last year &apos;s hits .
Some commentators have suggested that changing viewing habits and the increased popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix may be to blame .
Director Jon Favreau , who is currently working on Disney &apos;s forthcoming Jungle Book film , told the website Hollywood Reporter : `` I think times are changing . &apos;&apos;
We have to acknowledge that and not try to chase what used to be .
In contrast to Hollywood &apos;s current box office slump , Netflix recently saw revenue from its streaming content service reach $ 1.2bn , almost doubling last year &apos;s figure of $ 837m .
Last summer , director Steven Spielberg criticised studios for relying too much on comic book franchises , and predicted a Hollywood `` meltdown . &apos;&apos;
In light of the current downturn , some commentators are arguing that his dire prophecy may have held some truth to it .
With summer 2015 set to usher in a slate of potential big box office hits , including Avengers : Age of Ultron , Minions and Jurassic World , other figures within the film industry are feeling more optimistic .
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in box office takings as simply `` cyclical , &apos;&apos; telling Hollywood Reporter : `` Next summer will be the biggest box-office summer in history , and nobody will be worrying about the business . &apos;&apos;
North Korea threatens Seoul again by firing rocket
North Korea has fired another short-range rocket into the sea , Seoul has announced .
The rocket test reportedly occurred shortly after the end of joint military maneuvers by the United States and South Korea , which Pyongyang views as preparation for an invasion .
The Chagang province is located in the northwest part of the DPRK , along the country &apos;s border with China .
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry was quoted by the DPA news agency as saying that the rockets had been fired from a location in the northwest part of the DPRK and had reached a distance of about 200 km .
This is apparently the first time North Korea has fired a rocket from the Chagang province , South Korean media reported , citing military sources .
There is reportedly an underground launching ramp for Scud rockets in the province .
This is another of a series of similar tests , which the isolated North Korean regime has carried out in recent weeks .
This year North Korea carried out an unusually high number of rocket and artillery tests .
Nato summit : First protests in Newport and Cardiff
There have been protests over the weekend by those opposed to the Nato summit in Newport .
On Saturday , hundreds gathered in Newport city centre for an anti-Nato march .
And on Sunday in Cardiff , around 150 people came together at Cardiff &apos;s county hall for what was described as a counter-summit .
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us over the weekend and has spoken to protesters who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium .
Teens airlifted from Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushwalkers have been winched to safety after spending the night stranded in the NSW Blue Mountains .
THE 16-year-old girl and 18-year-old man went hiking just after midday on Sunday at Govetts Leap in Blackheath .
Concerned relatives called police about 8pm when they had n&apos;t returned home .
A search party involving local police and rescue squad was sent out and the pair were found about 11pm near Bridal Veil Falls .
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and hit his head .
Officers remained with the pair overnight and they were winched out on Monday morning .
They were taken by ambulance in a stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital .
Olomouc took away one point from Opava , and Vašíček had the potential winning goal on his foot .
The 23-year-old forward was able to decide , but in his two biggest chances he did not succeed .
After the goal , there was mainly a shot from nearby three minutes before the end , but instead of in the net it was caught by Opava goalkeeper Josef Květoňovi .
`` I had it on my foot , and I have to take advantage of such a chance .
I &apos;m angry at myself , &apos;&apos; Vašíček , dumping ashes onto his head .
`` I guess I should have shot higher below top of the net , &apos;&apos; he said .
Sigma &apos;s defense did not allow Opava much , but an exception was Mikul &apos;s shot from the 11th minute , which , however , was blocked by goalkeeper Riechl .
Then the Hanáci players began putting on pressure , but the defending home players did not give them a chance , and Květoňovi blocked goal attempts from a distance .
We compared for fifteen minutes , and then we took up the initiative .
We were already better in the second half , we had more of the game , and Opava posed a threat to us only in standard situations .
But Vašíček did not turn around the failed opportunity , and so it ended 0 : 0 , &apos;&apos; said Hanáků coach Leoše Kalvoda , expressing his disappointment .
Opava took the point also due to absences besides two injured players , Petr Vavřík and three-goal shooter Petr Ševčíkem , hosting in Silesia from Sigma , were also missing .
That team did not enable them to play , despite its previous policy .
Substitutes deserve closure .
`` Sigma took more of a soccer-like approach , but except for one standard we did not let them do anything , &apos;&apos; commented the Silesians &apos; coach , Petr Baránek .
A lot of emphasis , aggressiveness and combativeness could be seen .
`` The draw is probably deserved , because a point for us is a decent gain , &apos;&apos; he added .
With the draw , Sigma got to four points , which means thirteenth place .
Nothing that could satisfy team head Josef Lébra , who following defeat in a match with Znojmo conditioned his investment of a million on diametrically differing performance in subsequent matches .
`` We realized Mr. Lébra &apos;s warning , so there can be no talk about the guys not wanting to fight , &apos;&apos; Kalvoda noted , addressing top shooter Vašíček , and he added , `` I am confident that the moment will come , and as soon as he shoots a goal , it will start hitting the target .
But after the first successful shot , I will replace him immediately , so that he can shoot goals during other games too , &apos;&apos; Kalvoda said , laughing .
Al Pacino has captivated Venice twice .
Otherwise , the film festival is experiencing a crisis .
Following the major enthusiasm about the starting movie `` Birdman , &apos;&apos; whose director , Alejandro González Iňárritu , was included among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion award , the days that followed gave the impression that interest in the 71-year-old festival in Venice had somewhat faded .
Whether because the number of seats in the largest theater has increased to 1,400 or because `` Birdman &apos;&apos; was followed by critically acclaimed , but for viewers less attractive , films such as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s , `` View of Silence , &apos;&apos; and other films with social themes , from the American movie `` 99 Homes &apos;&apos; to Iranian `` Tales , &apos;&apos; seats still remained empty in cinemas .
Comics heroes
Even the red carpet in front of the movie palace did not draw as many crowds as in the past , and it reportedly ceased to be a problem to get a hotel room at the last minute .
The crisis is being talked about in Italy more than anywhere else , and it &apos;s no wonder that it has even affected established events such as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world .
Fortunately , the crisis does not feature a lack of celebrities , but they have been present only in connection with movies .
While young fans have craved autographs of comic super hero actors Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield , who played the roles successfully in `` 99 Homes , &apos;&apos; for all generations without any differences the main event was the visit by the legendary actor Al Pacino .
He even appeared immediately in two movies .
In the story `` Epiphany , &apos;&apos; screened outside of the competition and filmed by Oscar-winning Barry Levison according to the novel by Phillip Roth , 74-year-old Pacino has a role that is close to him : a highly celebrated actor who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life .
But seeing him immediately on the second day as the nerdy owner of an ironmongery from a small rural town in the movie `` Manglehorn , &apos;&apos; filmed by David Gordon Green , was truly an unforgettable experience .
The Volpi Cup for the best acting performance is not expected to miss him , but does an artist with Pacino &apos;s style need prizes ?
Maybe admiration from the public is the greatest satisfaction for him , especially Italian admiration , since although he was born in New York , Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his great grandparents originate .
Points for Italy
Italian film is generally doing very well in Venice .
`` Black Souls , &apos;&apos; directed by Francesco Munzi , became after `` Birdman &apos;&apos; the first movie that received a lengthy round of applause .
A Calabrese offshoot of the Mafia in it is viewed through family relationships between clans , who are fighting with each other over power and money , and the director managed to fulfill all expectations for a good film : good screenplay , camera shots , music and actors .
The psycho thriller `` The Hungry Heart , &apos;&apos; filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who through her fits of rage nearly kills her own child , also received acclaim .
However , the competing French films did not enjoy such a warm reception , neither `` Ransom for Glory &apos;&apos; nor `` 3 Hearts , &apos;&apos; both of which follow the traditional model of movies for consumption , which rely on the popularity of acting personalities .
But in the end , two really excellent films , `` Birdman &apos;&apos; and `` Black Souls , &apos;&apos; are not so few for the first half of the festival .
And while the festival films have somewhat depressive themes , the new film by Peter Bogdanovich entitled `` She &apos;s Funny That Way , &apos;&apos; a humorous comedy shown in Venice outside of the competition and filmed in the style of American comedies from the 1940s , managed to lift everyone &apos;s mood for more than a day .
Police in Prague have captured four producers of meth , who were bringing medications from Poland .
`` In the past few days , detectives arrested three men ages 42 , 42 , and 37 and a woman , 25 , who from last November to this August produced and sold meth in Prague 9 , &apos;&apos; said police spokeswoman Jana Rösslerová .
First on Tuesday , August 12 , the deployment unit on Cihlářské Street caught the 42-year-old organizer and dealer and a young woman , who figured in the group as a buyer of medications in Poland and a seller of doses .
Based on prior permission from the state prosecutor , police then arrested another member of the group the next day , a 37-year-old man .
The police caught the last of the four in the morning hours of Wednesday , August 20 , at the site of the Malešické incineration plant , &apos;&apos; the spokeswoman said .
The woman received a third of the drugs in exchange for bringing in the medications .
The main organizer was active in many places .
At a workshop in Letná , in a cottage in Horoměřicích , in an apartment on Koněvově Street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced meth , obtained various supplies and chemicals necessary for its production and ensured the transport of drugs containing pseudoephedrine from Poland .
He then weighed the produced drug , placed amounts of it in plastic sacks and then sold the meth .
A woman , who has yet to be punished , helped him with the transfer of the medications from Poland and with sales to drug users .
`` She received a third of the produced drugs from the organizer in exchange for her services , &apos;&apos; Rösslerová added .
Based on a court order , law enforcement officials also conducted several home searches , where they found drugs , industrial chemicals , digital scales , plastic sacks , injection syringes , hoses and other supplies and items , which according to experts can be considered a complete set of supplies for methamphetamine production .
The dealer had already been punished seven times since 1995 .
`` From the available evidence , the police discovered that the main organizer had been convicted in court of property crimes a total of seven times since 1995 , and the woman had never been convicted , &apos;&apos; the police spokesperson added .
The last man arrested was conditionally sentenced in 2006 for sexual assault , and a 37-year-old auto mechanic , who is not being held in custody during prosecution , has received nine court convictions since 2009 .
He was mostly sentenced for property crimes .
The investigator has charged three men and a woman with prohibited production and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons , for which they could face up to 10 years in prison .
`` For three persons , the investigator eventually filed a request with the state prosecutor asking that they be remanded into custody , and a judge eventually honored the request and placed them there , &apos;&apos; said the spokesperson .
The fourth accused , a 37-year-old recidivist , remains free .
His position and role in the activity was not as significant as the other accused .
Police are continuing to work with that man .

Canceling high schools and secondary schools does n&apos;t make sense .
The Czech Republic does not have enough generally education people , and moreover statistics show that high school students have good prospects .
The beginning of the school year is here .
Major preparations have been carried out in schools in the past fourteen days .
Most of this has been routine preparation , such as bringing flowers from their summer storage areas back to the classrooms and preparing chalk .
At Hořický High School , there will be a bit more to do .
A couple of days before the start of the season , they are looking for furniture , computers and other technical equipment as well as literature for the library .
This is neither the result of burglary or embezzlement . After three years , Hořický High School is reopening and resuming its activities .
Not on a public , but on a private platform .
The shortage of material furnishings is not because the founders were incompetent .
They had to expect that the school &apos;s existence would be confirmed by its entry into the register of schools administered by the Czech Ministry of Education , Youth and Sports .
France &apos;s Socialists should ` shut up and sort France out &apos; , Francois Hollande &apos;s key ally says
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided Left to `` show its affection &apos;&apos; for the embattled Socialist president , whose reshuffle has failed to meet the approval of the vast majority of French .
The president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loyality , he deserves our support .
`` It is our duty to remain at his sides , &apos;&apos; he said , to applause .
As a placatory gesture , the prime minister insisted his government would not call into question France &apos;s controversial 35-hour working week , despite inflammatory suggestions it should relax the rules earlier in the week by Emmanuel Macron , the new economy minister .
On Saturday , Mr Hollande had implored his fellow Socialists to remain `` united &apos;&apos; with the government .
But Christiane Taubira , the justice minister , put a spanner in the works by turning up to a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs and criticising the Socialist Party for letting the French `` lose faith in their future . &apos;&apos;
Marine Le Pen , the far-Right National Front leader , heaped scorn on the Socialists &apos; constant in-fighting by saying she did not see the new Valls government lasting more than just a few months .
Francois Hollande the Emperor has no clothes , but neither has Prince Manuel Valls , forced to put together a new government when the previous one did n&apos;t even survive the summer .
`` And the new one wo n&apos;t survive the fall or the winter either , &apos;&apos; Miss Le Pen told supporters .
She reiterated her party &apos;s call for a parliamentary dissolution , saying she was confident it could win early elections and stood ready to govern .
France &apos;s ruling party suffered a drubbing in March municipal elections and the far-right National Front came out on top in EU elections in May .
A poll in Sunday &apos;s Journal du Dimanche found 76 per cent of French believe the Socialist Party risks breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Mr Hollande &apos;s presidential term in 2017 .
Pascal Perrineau , a political scientist at Sciences Po university , warned the French would fast lose patience unless the new Socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record unemployment .
`` It has a small window of opportunity , but public opinion needs to quickly feel things are changing , &apos;&apos; he warned .
Otherwise , the situation could further degenerate .
Prague wo n&apos;t restrict gambling , busking before elections
Amendments to relevant regulations are not expected to be prepared and approved until after the capital city &apos;s new leaders take their positions .
Additional gambling halls will not disappear from Prague &apos;s streets before the municipal elections , and the city will not restrict street art .
Even walking dogs will not be restricted .
Prague will not manage by the October elections to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant regulations in the City Assembly .
`` Furthermore , the decisions about changes are not expected to be made by the city &apos;s current leaders , whose mandate ends in a few weeks , &apos;&apos; said council member Lukáš Manhart -LRB- TOP 09 -RRB- .
Several local town halls have decided to ban gambling facilities on their territory immediately in recent weeks , such as Prague 5 and 7 .
However , the gambling halls are not going away , and the regulations will not be changed for now .
That task will be up to the city &apos;s new leaders after the elections .
`` Right now we would not even technically be able to manage it in time , because of , for example , the deadlines for submitting feedback , etc . &apos;&apos; Manhart explained .
He pointed out that the last session of the current City Council , which must approve the change , will take place on September 11 .
A referendum on a total ban on gambling halls will take place on the day of the municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8 .
There is currently a ban on gambling halls in locations such as Prague 2 and Prague 12 .
For the same reasons , the regulation will not be changed even for street art , known as busking .
That activity has been complained about mainly by Prague 1 , which has already sent City Hall a proposed list of locations which it would like to add to the locations where it is already banned .
Prague 5 does not want musicians near Anděla either .
A directive that would regulate dog walking has been planned by the city for several months , but its preparation is not yet finished .
Locations of gambling halls and the issue of busking are being resolved by municipal decrees .
They can be issued and amended only by the Prague City Council .
The town halls have only an advisory say , and they themselves can not issue decrees .
Last week , supporters of Scottish independence were in reach of a victory .
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making the same mistake three times , when it almost placed billboards all over Scotland asking if Scots wanted to be rich .
However , you will not win over the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets , and you will not even gain their respect when you start threatening them .
The morals in the New Testament are still very relevant in Scotland , even though only a small number of Scots still go to church .
Scots have a much greater tendency to push money changers out of their houses of worship rather than allowing others to dictate to them how they should vote .
The Scottish nationalists &apos; leader , Alex Salmond , knows this very well , and therefore in the television discussion he repeatedly asked his rival , unionist Darling , whether he would be willing to respect `` the sovereign will of the Scottish people , &apos;&apos; if Scottish voters chose independence , and whether he would begin supporting a single currency for Scotland as well as for England .
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London bankers , and this situation made him grimace .
Of course , Darling will not support the mandate of Scottish voters .
Although this discussion about what currency Scotland would have has been more or less neutralized .
What really motivates Scottish voters are fairness , job opportunities and protection of the state health care system , which citizens enjoy free of charge .
Regarding the issue of the currency , Darling has supported London bankers and has also created the impression that he will not protest against privatization of health care .
In doing so , Salmond said , `` Get in bed with Conservatives . &apos;&apos;
That is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician .
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with Conservatives .
This has been confirmed by David Cameron , who spoke in Scotland not to voters , but to an association of `` bosses , &apos;&apos; the Confederation of British Industry .
It is becoming clear that Cameron &apos;s refusal to debate about independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a major mistake for the unionist campaign .
It makes Cameron look like a cowardly absentee at home .
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish prime minister .
Cameron at least managed to say that Scotland could be `` a successful independent country . &apos;&apos;
Alistair Darling can not manage to say anything like that , and it almost causes him physical pain .
What he is sharing is clear : Scots should n&apos;t jump up and down and must accept things as they are .
The longest year has 10 months .
A pessimistic start of school according to Miloše Urbana

Miloše Urbana `` Longest Year &apos;&apos;
The end was the best part of the vacation period , the last week , when nothing went anywhere any more and we just whiled away the hours during Indian summer , the calm before the storm , the quiet before the storm , the calm before stress .
New clothes , when they could be found at Tuzex , and shoes from East Germany .
Reading `` Rapid Arrows &apos;&apos; for the fiftieth time , swishing on our bikes around the Imperial all the way to behind Karlovy Vary , somewhere towards tennis courts , when it was no longer hot and the sun shined on our backs and shoulders and patted them with parting rays .
Slight nervousness in the evening , still in vacation mode , sleeping until half past ten , but in a week it will be worse , and shortly before falling asleep time stretches from a couple of minutes to two hours , followed by getting up at half past six in the morning .
Monday will come .
Usually it wo n&apos;t rain , but instead summer sneers in an evil manner before school .
Plowing through the eerie light of the commons and feeling like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight , there is the school , ZDŠ A .
Zápotockého , with a dreary pink facade , and in front of it there are the same familiar faces and some new ones , taller boys and bustier girls .
There are the bullies , so avoid them , though it &apos;s still interesting how they always stick together and how they are here so early .
And those grown-up-looking girls , who came shyly , are now giggling about something hysterically , indicating that something must have changed in their lives during vacation , while everything is still the same for me .
And what about the new first-graders , some of them nervous and others excited , why are they coming over here at all ?
Because they have to , as if school were like compulsory military service .
So as we enter , we sense the cool dampness of the floor , the slight odor of disinfectant , the annoyed janitor with a mop , unfortunately still the same one , who reportedly lends students a key to a metal locker , where textbooks can be left and of which there are still so few .
For a bottle .
The stench of the locker rooms is stuck in memory , but now it is n&apos;t present , because the location has been well ventilated , but in a week it will be worse .
Just imagining it turns one &apos;s stomach and initiates a headache .
A head that even worse handles math lessons , the devilish game for the chosen ones , among whom I do n&apos;t belong and never will .
Satisfactory and poor grades again or , God forbid , failing grades , hiding from tests , sitting down in the chair and zoning out as much as possible , being there and not being there , existing only as a name on the attendance sheet and dreaming up stories about more loving girls and starry buildings , antennas reaching into space , where no one competes with anyone , no one puts anyone down and no one trips you up .
The longest year has ten months .
And it &apos;s only the first day , now just like years ago .
She let her unborn daughters die .
She may face an exceptional sentence - Novinky.cz
The first birth occurred in March 2012 in a public restroom stall at the bus station in Jihlava .
Without anyone else &apos;s help , she gave birth to a small girl , and after cutting off her umbilical cord she placed the baby in a prepared blanket , hid the child under her jacket and took her to a side road , where she left her in the bushes just a few dozen meters from the roadway .
She gave birth on the way to school .
It happened a little early .
`` I was on the way to school .
In the bus , I felt like I needed to go to the restroom , and that &apos;s where I gave birth .
She was born live and looked at me .
I cut off the umbilical cord with scissors , which I was carrying to school , &apos;&apos; the accused said , adding that she was ashamed to be pregnant .
`` On the next day , she returned to the location , placed the child &apos;s body in a backpack and carried it away , then removed the body from the backpack , wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it under the stairway at her grandmother &apos;s home in Havlíčkobrodsku &apos;&apos; the lawsuit reads , adding that it is not entirely clear when the newborn &apos;s death occurred .
It could have been within fifteen minutes to half an hour , but even several hours after birth , through suffocation by the blanket or during placement beneath the jacket , freezing to death or bleeding from the unbandaged abdomen .
A similar incident occurred next year in the spring .
The woman at an unclear time between February and April 12 , when the child &apos;s body was found by passersby below the bushes near a pond in Havlíčkobrodsku , again gave birth by herself in secret .
This time in the bathroom of an attic apartment in a family house .
Even without checking whether the child had been born alive and even without cutting the umbilical cord , which was stretched around the neck , she placed the child into several pieces of plastic wrapping , including a plastic bag , and left her in the bathroom .
Then in the afternoon hours , she and her partner at the time took the child to a pond .
The boyfriend eventually turned her in
Both children &apos;s father was the defendant &apos;s boyfriend , who , however , reportedly did n&apos;t know about his partner &apos;s pregnancy .
That &apos;s another reason why he &apos;s not currently facing court proceedings , because he was punished for a misdemeanor violation legislation governing funerals .
He was also the one who later contacted police .
I do n&apos;t like that he is not being punished as an accomplice .
He manipulated with the child against my wishes .
I know that my solution was not right , but at the time it seemed humane to me , &apos;&apos; the accused , who allegedly submitted to the man in the relationship and was afraid of him , said , not hiding her anger .
During her testimony , the young woman spoke relatively calmly .
She did n&apos;t begin crying until she started talking about her relationship with her parents , from whom she had left after reaching adulthood .
She said she did n&apos;t want to kill .
`` They have been visiting me every 14 days , and they are doing everything they can for me , even though I know that I do n&apos;t deserve it , &apos;&apos; she said .
`` I did n&apos;t get baby clothes , because I did n&apos;t want children , I thought I was too young .
I kept wanting to put the child in a baby box , but I do n&apos;t know what happened or why I did n&apos;t do that .
That &apos;s something I ca n&apos;t explain to you , &apos;&apos; she said in response to the judge .
However , she denied that she had acted with the intention to kill the newborn .
She said furthermore that the second child had been born dead .
She had not stopped drinking alcohol even during pregnancy .
`` But I limited it .
And I did n&apos;t drink hard liquor .
And I limited smoking too , &apos;&apos; she said .
Although her pregnancy was visible in both cases , she always claimed repeatedly in response to questions that she had health problems and was retaining water .
She even told this to her boyfriend .
The main hearing will continue at the court in Hradec on Tuesday with testimony from court experts .
The verdict could be handed down as early as Wednesday .
The woman could face up to 18 years in prison or even an exceptional punishment .
Norwegian Cruise nears $ 3 billion Prestige Cruises deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O , the world &apos;s third largest cruise operator , is in advanced talks to acquire peer Prestige Cruises International Inc for around $ 3 billion , according to people familiar with the matter .
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise , a company with a market value of $ 6.8 billion , access to Prestige Cruises &apos; luxury cruise ships and affluent clientele as it competes with bigger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd -LRB- RCL.N -RRB- and Carnival Corp -LRB- CCL.N -RRB- .
An agreement may be announced as early as this week , the sources said on Sunday , cautioning that the talks could still fall apart .
The owner of Prestige Cruises , private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC -LRB- APO.N -RRB- , also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise .
The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are not public .
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises representatives did not respond to requests for comment , while an Apollo spokesman declined to comment .
Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships in routes spanning North America , the Mediterranean , the Baltic , Central America and the Caribbean .
It had revenues of $ 2.57 billion in 2013 , up 13 percent from 2012 .
Prestige Cruises , also based in Miami , operates under the Oceania and Regent brands , which together have eight cruise ships traveling to Scandinavia , Russia , the Mediterranean , North America , Asia , Africa and South America .
It posted revenues of $ 1.2 billion in 2013 , up 6 percent from the year earlier .
The $ 29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India .
Companies are racing to position themselves as the cruise operators of choice for these new customers .
Prestige Cruises registered with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering in January 2014 .
Apollo has been the company &apos;s majority shareholder following an $ 850 million deal in 2007 .
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd -LRB- GENT.KL -RRB- , the leisure and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay .
Apollo made a $ 1 billion investment in Norwegian Cruise in 2008 .
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013 .
Genting had a 28 percent stake , Apollo had a 20 percent stake and private equity firm TPG Capital LP had an 8 percent stake in the company as of the end of June , according to a regulatory filing .
Carnival , Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of the North American cruise passenger berth capacity , according to Prestige Cruises &apos; initial public offering registration document .
Hong Kong pro-democracy activists heckle China official day after vote ruling
A group of Beijing loyalists stood nearby waving China &apos;s flag .
The NPC Standing Committee on Sunday endorsed a framework to let only two or three candidates run in Hong Kong &apos;s 2017 leadership vote .
All candidates must first obtain majority backing from a nominating committee likely to be stacked with Beijing loyalists .
The decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot prompted pro-democracy activists to renew their vow to bring Hong Kong &apos;s financial hub to a halt with `` Occupy Central &apos;&apos; protests .
Political reform has been a major source of tension in Hong Kong , with China party leaders fearful of calls for democracy spreading to other cities .
Following the publication by Beijing of a white paper outlining China &apos;s authority over Hong Kong in June , democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on voting in the special administrative region , and hundreds of thousands marched to the city &apos;s business district and staged a sit-in .
Li &apos;s briefing is being organized by the Hong Kong government and China &apos;s Liaison Office in Hong Kong .
The vice chairman of the Standing Committee &apos;s Legislative Affairs Commission , Zhang Rongshun , and the Deputy Director of the State Council &apos;s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office , Feng Wei , were also due to speak in a series of briefings throughout the day .
Student activists said they would gather outside of the Hong Kong chief executive &apos;s office in the afternoon .
Britain made no mention of democracy for Hong Kong until the dying days of about 150 years of colonial rule .
Putin demands Kiev open ` statehood &apos; talks with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease battling separatists in the country &apos;s east and immediately begin negotiations on the breakaway region &apos;s `` statehood , &apos;&apos; according to Russian news accounts of his remarks .
His spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , later clarified that Putin did n&apos;t mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia , but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests .
But Putin &apos;s call upon the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russia insurgents as equals corresponded with the apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five months ago : Help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region virtual independence to align with Russia instead of the West .
In an interview with state-run Channel One television , Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to recover separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were seized in March and April , after Moscow annexed Ukraine &apos;s Crimean peninsula on March 18 .
The Kremlin and the separatists have lately branded the seized territory `` Novorossiya , &apos;&apos; or `` New Russia , &apos;&apos; a term that harkens to pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian empire .
Putin said that anyone who believed peace talks are in the offing as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns for an Oct. 26 parliamentary election and while government troops are attacking civilian communities in separatist-held regions is `` a prisoner to illusions , &apos;&apos; Itar-Tass reported .
`` We must immediately commence substantive talks and not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the statehood status of southeast Ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there , &apos;&apos; he said .
Peskov said Putin &apos;s reference to statehood was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership as it struggles to allay fears in the Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger .
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy , Peskov said .
It &apos;s not a matter to be negotiated between Ukraine and Russia , Peskov said , `` because it &apos;s not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal Ukrainian conflict . &apos;&apos;
The Kremlin spokesman &apos;s intercession to correct the `` misinterpretation &apos;&apos; of Putin &apos;s remarks underscored the Russian leadership &apos;s approach to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east differently from its outright seizure of Crimea , where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian .
Moscow would have a much more difficult fight to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine , as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian and pre-conflict polls showed broad support for staying within Ukraine .
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would grant regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations , effectively handing the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea .
The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago is home to Russia &apos;s main naval fleet as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic coastal resorts .
The regions between Russia &apos;s Rostov area and Crimea are also home to mines , factories and foundries that produce vital components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections -- weigh constitutional amendments to give more control to the disparate regions over their finances and the status of languages .
But his vision of autonomy appears to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels Moscow is accused of arming and instigating .
Putin &apos;s latest call on Kiev to deal with the separatist leaders as equals followed new advances by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov .
The Russian-backed separatists took control of the town of Novoazovsk in a drive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the opening of a campaign to seize the strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea .
That has spurred a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol , a steelmaking port of 500,000 that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway into the Crimean peninsula .
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to urge action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
`` We are close to the point of no return , &apos;&apos; Poroshenko warned .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit took no definitive action ; the leaders called for drafting more punishing sanctions on Russia to be imposed in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armor and 1,000 troops last week moved into the Donetsk region to bolster the beleaguered separatists , Col. Andriy Lysenko , spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council , told reporters in Kiev on Saturday .
The first of a reported 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped in Ilovaysk by the Russian incursion were swapped Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured inside Ukrainian territory a week ago , Lysenko said Sunday .
Nude photo scandal embroils Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten has vented his disgust at hackers who may have stolen nude images of fiancee Gabi Grecko and a who &apos;s who of Hollywood A-listers .
Tinseltown is reeling after a series of explicit photos showing a nude Jennifer Lawrence hit the internet in a major celebrity hacking scandal .
The hacker responsible is said to have 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and superstars including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne , singers Rihanna , Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actors Kirsten Dunst .
Australian actors Teresa Palmer , Emily Browning , Yvonne Strahovski , and Melbourne-based Grecko also had personal pictures allegedly retrieved due to an iCloud leak .
There are 101 celebrity names on the list .
Edelsten , who proposed to Grecko last month , told Confidential : `` It &apos;s disgusting . &apos;&apos;
All private correspondence and images should remain private .
It &apos;s disgraceful that personal information can be stolen and dispersed to others .
Grecko , who is in New York , reportedly told a news website the hacking was `` shameful &apos;&apos; and those targeted would `` feel violated . &apos;&apos;
The hacker is believed to have 30 images of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman , including two frames where she is lounging topless in a pool .
Palmer &apos;s film credits include Love And Honor , opposite Liam Hemsworth .
Palmer , Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actress Browning yesterday had no comment on the hacked pictures .
A representative for Lawrence told TMZ : `` This is a flagrant violation of privacy . &apos;&apos;
Actor Seth Rogen lashed out at the hacker , tweeting : `` Posting pics hacked from a cell phone is really no different than selling stolen merchandise . &apos;&apos;
Just legally speaking , it should n&apos;t be tolerated to report stolen pics .
Sigma reconciles with Lébra , even without victory
Olomouc - the thunder and lightning that co-owner of Sigma Olomouc , Josef Lébra , unleashed on his subordinates last week seem to be over .
This is despite the fact that from Opava they eventually brought away only one point for a goalless draw .
Therefore , the team boss reconciled just a little with the team &apos;s efforts and combativeness .
The money for payouts is expected to come to the team soon .
`` I will keep one more game , as I spoke about last week , but I &apos;m already much more optimistic , &apos;&apos; Lébra confirmed , explained that although Sigma had not won , the players convinced him with their improved performance .
The combativeness and efforts with which we played mainly in the second half were exactly what I want to see from players .
In such situation , I am able to forgive them for not winning .
If we had played that way from the start of the season , then I am convinced that we would n&apos;t have lost , &apos;&apos; Lébra said .
In Opava , Sigma put a stop to the initial pressure from the home team , and then it balanced the game , and in the second half it was already better .
Following victory , Kalvoda &apos;s entrusted players exerted efforts , but they did not achieve any goals , and so they could n&apos;t win .
`` The result is not what we expected .
But for complete satisfaction , we were missing only one transformed opportunity , &apos;&apos; said Lébra , who believes , however , that the change in the players &apos; approach was caused only by his threat .
`` There were certainly multiple aspects .
Both from my side and from the side of the coach or fans , &apos;&apos; Lébra said .
Sigma has to anticipate pressure .
After the game in Opava , the players did not want to comment much regarding the events from last week .
`` I &apos;m trying to put these things completely behind me .
I have tried not to concede the situation , &apos;&apos; young goalkeeper Michal Reichl said , shaking his head .
Lébra &apos;s statement from last week was left entirely without comment by offensive player Václav Vašíček , who did not fulfill Sigma &apos;s biggest opportunity in the Saturday game .
However , he eventually spoke about it just a little .
`` We &apos;ll always be under pressure .
Everyone wants to tear us apart .
Today we demonstrated that if we fight and kick everyone &apos;s ass , then it works , &apos;&apos; he said .
They took the warning to heart .
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hesitate to say that the preparation for the game were not the easiest , given the atmosphere that was present in Olomouc last week .
It was very difficult .
But I think that the boys realized that , and today it was clear that they had taken Mr. Lébra &apos;s warning to heart .
This is true although even previously they did not want to fight and they slacked off , &apos;&apos; the Olomouc coach said .
`` It was similar to today in the first fifteen minutes .
It lasted until we came to terms with the toughness and realized what a second league is all about .
That it &apos;s not about soccer , but mainly about fighting , &apos;&apos; Kalvoda said .
All that is left to do is hope that in the next games things will work for Sigma from the beginning .
`` I would really like to believe that , &apos;&apos; he added .
