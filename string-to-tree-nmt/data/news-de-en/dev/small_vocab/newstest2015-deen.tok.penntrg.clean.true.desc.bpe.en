recon@@ nec@@ ting With the Ver@@ y American ideal That Labor Rights Ar@@ e Human Rights
con@@ gressmen K@@ ei@@ th E@@ lli@@ son and John Lewi@@ s have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right .
`` As go unions , so go middle-class jobs , '@@ ' says E@@ lli@@ son , the M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota Democrat who serves as a Congressional Progressive Cau@@ cus co-@@ chair .
that '@@ s why I '@@ m proud to introduce the employee Em@@ power@@ ment Act with civil rights icon John Lewi@@ s .
this ground@@ -@@ breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-@@ union forces in their tracks
am@@ ending the National Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for engaging in union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compens@@ atory and punitive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative .
but it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what E@@ lli@@ son , Lewi@@ s and the co@@ sponsors of their legislation are proposing is as a recon@@ nec@@ tion with a very American idea .
despite the bat@@ tering that unions have taken in recent years - in Wis@@ consi@@ n , Mich@@ i@@ gan and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embrace , extend and respect labor rights .
there was a time , within the living memory of millions of Americans , when this country championed democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same breath .
when the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Dou@@ glas Mac@@ Arthur and his aides encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that H@@ ide@@ ki To@@ jo '@@ s militarized autocracy would be replaced with democracy .
fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan , they included language that explicitly recognized that `` the right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed . '@@ '
when the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Adolf Hitler '@@ s fascism was replaced with mus@@ cular democracy .
recognizing that workers would need to organize and make their voices heard in the new nation , the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared : `` The right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profession .
agreements that restrict or seek to imp@@ air this right shall be null and vo@@ id ; measures directed to this end shall be unlawful .
when former First Lady Ele@@ an@@ or Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights , which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global co@@ ven@@ ant , Roosevelt and the draf@@ ters included a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests . '@@ '
for generations , Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights .
when this country counsel@@ ed other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies , Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected .
now , with those rights under assault in America , it is wise , indeed , to re@@ commit to the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society .
as the Re@@ ver@@ end Martin Luther King J@@ r. said fifty years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the labor movement did not diminish the strength of the nation but enlarged it .
by raising the living standards of millions , labor mira@@ culously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to und@@ re@@ amed of levels of production .
those who attack labor forget these simple truths , but history re@@ members them .
history re@@ members , as should we .
the formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long overdue .
K@@ ei@@ th E@@ lli@@ son and John Lewi@@ s are rene@@ wing ideals that have historically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy .
judge temporarily blocks law that could close all Louisi@@ ana abortion clinics
a U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Louisi@@ ana law that advocates say would likely have closed all five abortion clinics in the state .
the measure , signed into law by Louisi@@ ana Governor B@@ ob@@ by Jin@@ dal in June and due to take effect S@@ ept . 1 , would require doctors who perform abor@@ tions to have patient admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice .
however , the judge '@@ s ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abor@@ tions while seeking such privileges .
`` plain@@ ti@@ ffs will be allowed to operate law@@ fully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges , '@@ ' Federal Judge John de@@ Gra@@ v@@ elles wrote in the decision .
a hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law .
abortion rights activists applauded the decision , the latest in a string of ru@@ lings against similar measures , saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges .
`` Today '@@ s ruling ensures Louisi@@ ana women are safe from an under@@ handed law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights , '@@ ' said Nancy Nor@@ th@@ up , president and chief executive of the Center for Re@@ productive Rights , which su@@ ed to block the law on behalf of three of the state '@@ s five clinics .
it was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clinics who were not plain@@ ti@@ ffs in the suit and have also applied for admitting privileges .
Louisi@@ ana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws , with courts recently ruling un@@ constitutional such measures in Al@@ ab@@ ama and Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i .
key parts of a Texas law that would have shut@@ tered most remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Fri@@ day .
abortion rights campaigners , along with the American College of obst@@ etri@@ cians and G@@ yn@@ ec@@ ologists and the American Medical Association , say admitting privileges laws impose medi@@ cally unnecessary requirements on doctors .
anti-@@ abortion advocates have countered that the measures aim to protect women '@@ s health , though some have also lau@@ ded their effect of shut@@ tering clinics .
only one doctor who performs abor@@ tions in Louisi@@ ana has hospital admitting privileges , the Center for Re@@ productive Rights said .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abor@@ tions , that doctor , fearful for his safety , would stop carrying out the procedure , the group said .
in arguing against the ruling , Louisi@@ ana officials said they would not punish doctors performing abor@@ tions while their applications for admitting privileges were pending .
delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment mean o@@ vari@@ an cancer kills more in rural areas
Angel@@ ina J@@ oli@@ e and her brother James have post@@ ed a video tribute to their late mother who died of o@@ vari@@ an cancer in 2007 .
women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from o@@ vari@@ an cancer than their city counterparts .
researchers analy@@ sed medical records of more than 1@@ 100 Australian women diagnosed with o@@ vari@@ an cancer in 2005 , finding just 35 per cent lived for five years after diagnosis .
lead rese@@ ar@@ cher Susan Jordan , of the Q@@ IM@@ R Ber@@ gh@@ of@@ er Medical Research Institute , said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
small study : new drugs may slow lung , o@@ vari@@ an cancer
the researchers tra@@ cked the women '@@ s medical jour@@ neys across seven years .
D@@ r Jordan said a woman '@@ s age at the time of diagnosis , o@@ vari@@ an cancer type , having existing illnesses and socio-@@ economic status also imp@@ acted on survival chances .
older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the poorest survival rates .
those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from o@@ vari@@ an cancer , D@@ r Jordan suggested delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors .
`` This disease is best treated by g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological on@@ c@@ ology sur@@ ge@@ ons and they '@@ re mostly based in major cities , '@@ ' she said .
despite improving tel@@ e-@@ medicine services to l@@ essen the tyranny of distance , she suggested more fl@@ y-@@ in , fl@@ y-@@ out services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people in treatment away from their communities could help .
D@@ r Jordan said regardless of geographical status , the study found long-term survival among women with o@@ vari@@ an cancer was poor , reinforcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
the research , funded by the Rio T@@ into ride to conqu@@ er cancer , will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
in March 2012 , at 33 years of age , young Gold Coast m@@ um Eli@@ sh@@ a Ne@@ a@@ ve was told that she had an aggressive form of o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
garden cent@@ res ru@@ e fall in homeowners
the drop , coupled with a particular decline in the number of homeowners aged under 35 , could result in garden cent@@ res losing out on tens of millions of po@@ unds a year when today '@@ s young consumers reach the `` core gar@@ dening age group , '@@ ' according to the H@@ T@@ A '@@ s study , which was reported by the Financial Times .
according to the report , people r@@ enting properties spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that those with their own homes spend on their gar@@ dens .
it cited the rise in people living in highly urban@@ ised areas with no gar@@ dens , the popularity of pa@@ ving over front gar@@ dens for par@@ king and shrinking garden size as other factors threatening the industry , which is worth an estimated £ 5 billion in sales each year .
greater London , where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years , has Britain '@@ s lowest spend per household on gar@@ dening products .
the H@@ T@@ A and Royal hor@@ ti@@ cultural Society said that r@@ enting property or a lack of garden space did not mean people could not grow plants .
guy bar@@ ter , chief hor@@ ti@@ cultural adviser to the R@@ H@@ S , said : `` Con@@ tain@@ er gar@@ dening , for example , is especially popular with ren@@ ters who can move their plants when they re@@ locate . '@@ '
the H@@ T@@ A report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the garden retail sector '@@ s ` golden age '@@ ' as a result of increased home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to mid-@@ 1990s .
it also predicted an improved market this year due to better weather following un@@ fa@@ vo@@ urable conditions in March and April last year .
in Pakistan , the protest movement led by political opponent , Im@@ ran Khan , and the spiritual leader , Tah@@ i@@ ru@@ l Q@@ ad@@ ri , continues .
in the capital city of Islamabad , around 1000 demonstrators stor@@ med the government-@@ run television station , P@@ TV .
however , information minister , Per@@ v@@ ai@@ z Ras@@ hid , said that soldiers had been able to force the protesters back out of the building .
the TV station stopped broad@@ casting for approximately 40 minutes , but has since begun to broadcast again .
at the same time , around 3000 demonstrators attempted to reach the official residen@@ cy of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif .
approximately one kilom@@ et@@ re away , they clas@@ hed with security security services , armed with sticks and stones .
the police used te@@ ar gas .
the demonstrators demanded Sharif '@@ s resignation , which he refused .
the Pakistan Army called for a political solution to the conflict `` without delay and without resor@@ ting to violence . '@@ '
following a meeting at its headquarters on Sunday evening , the military announced : `` The Army remains committed to its task of ensuring security for the State . '@@ '
the military plays an important role in Pakistan and has taken power by force several times in the past .
the opposition politician , Im@@ ran Khan , accuses Prime Minister Sharif of ri@@ gging the parliamentary elections , which took place in May last year .
the protests escal@@ ated at the weekend , after Khan and Q@@ ad@@ ri called on their followers to advance to Sharif '@@ s residence .
there were three people killed .
Turkey summ@@ ons US diplomat O@@ ver spying Report
the Turkish foreign ministry has sum@@ mon@@ ed the most senior U.S. diplomat in the country for clari@@ fication of a report about American and British spying in Turkey .
deputy Prime Minister Bul@@ ent said the U.S. charge d@@ '@@ Aff@@ aires and Turkish officials had discussed the report Mon@@ day .
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The inter@@ c@@ ept said that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward S@@ now@@ den show that Turkey was a high priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services .
according to Turkish news wi@@ res , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan down@@ played the importance of the report , saying that all major countries spi@@ ed on each other .
an earlier report that Germany '@@ s main intelligence agency had also targeted Ankara drew a more angry response from the Turkish government .

Mag@@ alu@@ f police chief charged over corruption
the cla@@ im@@ ants presented proof of ex@@ tor@@ tion by policemen and Cal@@ vi@@ à T@@ own H@@ all civil servants at M@@ all@@ or@@ ca '@@ s public prosecutor '@@ s office on Fri@@ day .
the head of Cal@@ vi@@ à police on the holiday island of Maj@@ or@@ ca has been arrested following corruption claims filed by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hot@@ spot of Mag@@ alu@@ f .
chief In@@ spec@@ tor José Antonio Nav@@ ar@@ ro has been re@@ mand@@ ed in custody following corruption claims made against him by several businessmen from Pun@@ ta Ball@@ ena , the street where most of Mag@@ alu@@ f '@@ s bars and night@@ clubs are located .
according to online daily M@@ all@@ or@@ ca Di@@ ario , the cla@@ im@@ ants presented proof of ex@@ tor@@ tion by policemen and Cal@@ vi@@ à T@@ own H@@ all civil servants at the office of Maj@@ or@@ ca '@@ s anti-corruption prosecutor on Fri@@ day .
two other local police officers were arrested by Spanish Civil Guards in connection to the corruption claims and will have to be questioned by a judge alongside Nav@@ ar@@ ro .
Spanish national daily A@@ BC reported the dis@@ gr@@ unt@@ led night@@ club owners as saying fa@@ vo@@ uri@@ tism by authorities was having a serious effect on their businesses .
`` It '@@ s not about making money anymore , it '@@ s about surviving , '@@ ' one of the businessmen told the court .
you do n@@ '@@ t mess with our livelihoods .
we have nothing to lose .
Mag@@ alu@@ f made international headlines this summer as a result of a viral YouTube video which showed an 18@@ -year-old British holi@@ da@@ y@@ maker performing f@@ ell@@ ati@@ o on 24 men during a pu@@ b cra@@ wl .
island authorities have since attempted to cl@@ amp down on the dr@@ unk and disorderly behavi@@ our of Mag@@ alu@@ f holiday rev@@ ell@@ ers by minimizing numbers on the notorious alco@@ hol@@ -@@ fuelled bar cra@@ w@@ ls .
in addition , the Pla@@ y@@ house club where the f@@ ell@@ ati@@ o incident took place was forced to shut down for a year , while Pla@@ y@@ house and the bar cra@@ wl organizers carnage were jointly fin@@ ed € 5@@ 5,000 -LRB- $ 7@@ 3,000 -RRB- .
the tourist resort of Mag@@ alu@@ f , mainly popular with young British holi@@ da@@ y@@ makers , has also seen numerous alco@@ hol@@ -@@ fuelled accidents involving the cra@@ ze known as `` bal@@ con@@ ing , '@@ ' where people jump from one bal@@ con@@ y to another or from a bal@@ con@@ y into the hotel pool .
first day of spring marked with we@@ t and blu@@ stery conditions imp@@ acting Ad@@ el@@ ai@@ de Air@@ port flights
spring has sprung a win@@ try surprise on southern South Australia , bringing heavy sho@@ wers and strong winds that have affected flights at Ad@@ el@@ ai@@ de Air@@ port .
a further 5@@ mm of rain fell on the city in the evening up to 9@@ p@@ m , following the 6.@@ 6@@ mm that fell overnight on Sunday .
the latest rain came cour@@ tes@@ y of a couple of short , blu@@ stery sho@@ wers , including a burst that started just before 8@@ p@@ m that dump@@ ed almost 4@@ mm in about 10 minutes .
after winter delivered an early dose of spring last week , temperatures dropped again on Mon@@ day to a high of just 15.@@ 8@@ C in the city .
the squ@@ ally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Vir@@ gin Air@@ lines flight from Melbourne to Ad@@ el@@ ai@@ de .
the plane was scheduled to land just after 7.@@ 30@@ p@@ m but was hit by wind@@ she@@ ar - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out .
wind gu@@ sts were reaching about 50@@ k@@ m@@ /@@ h on the ground at Ad@@ el@@ ai@@ de Air@@ port at the time .
flight data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.@@ 40@@ p@@ m .
that flight '@@ s delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights , including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Q@@ ant@@ as flight from Sydney .
a top of 16@@ C is forecast for Ad@@ el@@ ai@@ de on Tu@@ es@@ day , with the chance of a sho@@ wer or two .
Mat@@ th@@ ies thinks : high time for the Internet Of Thin@@ gs
faced with runaway advances in consumer technology , which threaten to turn our homes into high-tech control rooms , our repor@@ ter , Bern@@ d Mat@@ th@@ ies , takes heart from one electronic g@@ ad@@ get that he really feels at home with .
as I write this , my eye cat@@ ches the spiral cable , which connec@@ ts the hand@@ set to the telephone , and I '@@ m thinking : W@@ ow ! how re@@ tr@@ o is that then ?
but it started me thinking : if the cable was not there , all the hand@@ sets would be lying scattered around the house in no time at all - and that would be even more re@@ tr@@ o .
in any case , in the eleph@@ ant@@ ine -LRB- eleph@@ ant@@ ine ?
no - a typ@@ ing error - electronics -RRB- sector , the basic rule is that the latest wonder of today is electronic rub@@ bi@@ sh tomorrow - once bought , it '@@ s out of date .
and anyone , for example , who still has an old C@@ R@@ T TV in their living room , is merely announcing to the world that they '@@ re not interested in T@@ Vs !
so why these thoughts ?
because the International Consu@@ mer Elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics Fair -LRB- IFA -RRB- in Berlin , once again showed us how incompetent we are when it comes to questions about technology .
the lay@@ man , who once knew , blind , how to operate a washing machine and a CD@@ -@@ Player , is today faced with high@@ fal@@ utin expert talk about an array of g@@ ad@@ gets , the purpose of which he does n@@ '@@ t even understand . `` connected Home , We@@ ar@@ ables , Health C@@ are and Ur@@ ban Technologi@@ es , '@@ ' are what the press office promise us .
yes - and ?
what do you say to people , who clearly talk such gu@@ ff voluntarily ?
really , they '@@ ve been trying to sell us the Internet of Thin@@ gs for our homes , for the last 20 years .
so that your yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t can place itself on your shopping list ; so that your fi@@ re-@@ alarm can tell you - when you '@@ re lying on the be@@ ach in the Mal@@ di@@ ves - that there '@@ s a fire in your study back home .
and would n@@ '@@ t it be wonderful if we could set our home air@@ -@@ condi@@ tioning to switch on just before we get back from the office ... ?
yes - but that presupposes that you have an air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ er in the first place .
however , one dream really will come true very soon : we lift our wri@@ st wat@@ ches , and in a loud voice say `` vacuum ! '@@ ' - and at home the vacuum cleaner ro@@ bot begins to Hoover .
fantas@@ tic .
everything is ge@@ ared to nothing less than a revolution : `` The boundary between white and bro@@ wn goods is becoming blur@@ red , '@@ ' mut@@ ters an industry insider . you can connect your washing machine to your head@@ phone ; your steam o@@ ven can send you a weather report ; and your dat@@ a-@@ go@@ gg@@ les can tell you how long your pi@@ zza still has to go in the o@@ ven - but that '@@ s of little use if you '@@ re sitting in a traffic j@@ am .
from everyday experience , we also know : if you need a new model g@@ ad@@ get to urgently work , the battery will almost certainly be empty .
which is another reason why the spiral cable on the telephone will out-@@ live the next IFA exhi@@ bits in Berlin .
Israeli Chil@@ dren Ret@@ ur@@ n to School After Gaza War
thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school Mon@@ day after spending the summer in bomb shel@@ ters as rockets and mort@@ ars rained on their communities during the 50-@@ day Israel-@@ Hamas war , while schools in Gaza remained shut@@ tered as the territory recovered from the fighting .
the start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to rock@@ et-@@ scar@@ red communities in southern Israel , but the signs of the fighting remained fresh .
in the southern city of Ash@@ do@@ d , employees at the `` Pas@@ ho@@ sh '@@ ' kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , which was struck by a rocket , removed sh@@ rap@@ nel marks off the walls and sli@@ des ahead of the students ' arrival .
`` We are a little scared but we are exc@@ ited , '@@ ' said R@@ on@@ it Bar@@ t , a re@@ sident of Ki@@ b@@ bu@@ tz Saad and an English teacher in its school .
a lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine .
her 1@@ 1-@@ year-old daughter , Sh@@ ani Bar@@ t , said it felt a `` little bit wei@@ r@@ d '@@ ' to suddenly be going back to school .
`` There were some difficult times and we did n@@ '@@ t leave our houses at all , '@@ ' she said .
President Re@@ u@@ ven Riv@@ lin visited the Ki@@ b@@ bu@@ tz , which is located close to the Gaza border , to offer his support .
until a cease-fire halted the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in@@ doors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rocket and mort@@ ar fire .
many residents of Nah@@ al Oz , a community close to the Gaza frontier where a 4-@@ year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mort@@ ar shell , are hesitant about coming back .
the Education Ministry said about a dozen families still had not returned .
their children have been placed in altern@@ ate schools for the time being .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in S@@ der@@ ot , a Gaza border town that has been hard hit by Palestinian fire .
he urged the children to study hard and said `` we will make sure to provide you with knowledge and provide you with security . '@@ '
Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce last Tu@@ es@@ day .
the cease-fire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues unresolved , such as Hamas ' demand for the lifting of an Israel-@@ Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the re@@ opening of Gaza '@@ s air and se@@ ap@@ orts .
Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt .
the war killed more than 2,@@ 100 Palestinians , three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 4@@ 94 children , according to Palestinian and U.@@ N@@ . estimates .
Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants , though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims .
on the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,@@ 5@@ 91 rockets and mort@@ ars at Israeli cities during the fighting , mostly in the south .
the Israeli military , meanwhile , carried out more than 5,000 air@@ strikes and other attacks .
the Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza , and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.@@ N@@ . schools turned into mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shel@@ ters .
with tens of thousands of people still in the shel@@ ters and fighting still raging , education officials delayed the start of the school year last week .
`` I hope the school will open soon to complete our education , just like the world '@@ s children and Jewish children , '@@ ' said Mohammad Am@@ ara , a 13@@ -year-old boy staying in a Gaza City school .
following the election in Sa@@ x@@ ony : CDU vice-@@ chairman Stro@@ b@@ l questions NP@@ D@@ -@@ banning process
in view of the loss of votes by the German right-wing extremist party , NP@@ D , in Sa@@ x@@ ony , the national CD@@ U-@@ Vice-@@ Chairman , Thomas Stro@@ b@@ l , has called for an end of the on-@@ going NP@@ D@@ -@@ banning process , which is taking place in the German Federal Constitutional Court .
Berlin - Acc@@ ording to CDU National vice-@@ chairman , Thomas Stro@@ b@@ l , the current trial taking place in the German Federal Constitutional Court to decide whether to ban the NP@@ D from the political process , should be brought to an end .
according to the `` Lei@@ p@@ ziger Volks@@ zeitung , '@@ ' the NP@@ D performed worse than last time , '@@ ' said Stro@@ b@@ l , who is also CDU regional boss in Bad@@ en-@@ Wür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg .
that is a good development , one that should make us happy , and this trend leads me to think that we should fight the NP@@ D in the ballot box , and not in the constitutional court .
on Sunday , the NP@@ D narrowly missed achieving the five percent barrier , which would have seen it enter parliament .
a first attempt at securing a ban of the right-wing extremist party failed in 2003 , because the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution also had in@@ forman@@ ts in the top ech@@ el@@ ons of the NP@@ D .
in December 2013 the Bundes@@ rat submitted a further banning action to the constitutional court , which is based in Kar@@ l@@ s@@ ruhe , after spending a long time preparing the case .
the German government and Bundestag did not take part in the banning submission .
Har@@ burg : t@@ ents for new refugees
refugees at Ne@@ ul@@ änder Platz will now be accommod@@ ated in t@@ ents .
the rec@@ eption centr@@ e for refugees in Har@@ burg is full-@@ to-@@ bursting .
the German Inter@@ nal Affairs Authority has now given the go@@ -@@ ahead for the Red Cro@@ ss to er@@ ect the three t@@ ents .
the local area politicians were only informed about it a short while before - and they are not happy .
`` These one-@@ off actions only stir up more doubts in the minds of the public , and they give the local politicians no chance to work out a constructive plan of how to house refugees in a humane manner , '@@ ' said , for example , Brit@@ ta Herr@@ mann , chair@@ woman of the Green Party in the Har@@ burg district assembly .
her party is calling on the Har@@ burg district authority to deploy empty houses to accommodate the refugees .
96 refugees can be accommod@@ ated in the three t@@ ents .
the reasons for the over-@@ crowding in the initial rec@@ eption cent@@ res are mainly the sudden increase in numbers of those seeking help , as well as the fact that the authorities can not make available enough places in suitable accommodation .
many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months .
housing prices have post@@ ed their strongest winter gain in seven years , according to a wi@@ del@@ y-@@ watched gau@@ ge .
the R@@ P data C@@ ore@@ Logi@@ c Hed@@ onic home value index of Australian capital city dwell@@ ing prices rose by 1.1 per cent in August , R@@ P data said on Mon@@ day .
the rise brought the total gain over the June , July and August to 4.@@ 2 per cent , the biggest rise over the winter months since 2007 .
annual growth in prices came in at 1@@ 0.@@ 9 per cent , more than double the gain of the 12 months to August 2013 , but the gains were not evenly spread across the country .
R@@ P data research director T@@ im lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two tier market .
the R@@ P data figures show Sydney home prices rose by 16@@ .@@ 1 per cent in the past year , while Melbourne '@@ s were up by 1@@ 1.7 per cent .
the next strongest markets were Ad@@ el@@ ai@@ de , B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e and Darwin , with price rises averaging between five and six per cent .
at the other end of the scale was Can@@ ber@@ ra , hit by government spending cutbacks , where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent through the year .
Mr lawless said that now spring has begun there would be a rise in list@@ ings of properties for sale over the coming few months , which would be a `` real test '@@ ' for the market .
`` considering the ongoing high rate of au@@ ction clear@@ ance rates , a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment , it '@@ s likely that dwell@@ ing values will rise even further over the next three months , '@@ ' he said .
in an announcement to the regional German newspaper ` die Neue Presse ' P@@ ötz@@ l contradic@@ ted the comments of managing director , Peer Med@@ au , and said that the latter was behaving like a `` military general . '@@ '
this was not the style of the college , he said .
he said that the Med@@ au family `` were informed about the plans of the college in the middle of June .
they are simply wrong to say that they only learned of the plans in July . '@@ '
at the same time he also said that the plans were not about `` final decisions already made , '@@ ' but rather about `` stating preferences . '@@ '
he also said that the building work to widen the narrow access road up to the cast@@ le would not be as radical as the Med@@ aus feared .
it was not - and will not be - a matter of a nine met@@ re-@@ wide road .
we currently aim to widen it by 5.5 met@@ res , which is one met@@ re wider than before , '@@ ' explained P@@ ötz@@ l .
P@@ ötz@@ l ref@@ utes the argument of the Med@@ au concern , namely that its cost-@@ free par@@ king places which belong to the school , will in future only be available for use by the college students .
it wo n@@ '@@ t be a case of everywhere being par@@ ked up , because we have time to find intelligent solutions , as has been the case with other car parks , too .
think of the neighbo@@ urs
the children '@@ s nur@@ ser@@ y Berg@@ wich@@ tel , which is situ@@ ated on the space in question , and in front of the front door of which the access road to the par@@ king level will run , is `` not to be imp@@ acted '@@ ' according to the college president .
he is far more concerned to point out `` that it '@@ s not only an issue concerning the children '@@ s nur@@ ser@@ y , rather it is about the people who live by the entrance to Fried@@ rich@@ -@@ Strei@@ b@@ -@@ Stra@@ sse and the 800 school@@ children of the ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent secondary school .
it '@@ s therefore about a lot more than the individual interests of the Med@@ au gent@@ le@@ men , '@@ ' he said .
whether the criticism by the parents ' association for the children '@@ s nur@@ ser@@ y is correct that the extension of the road will lead to `` one of the few remaining natural sp@@ aces in C@@ ob@@ ur@@ g being lost , '@@ ' he said the `` readers can decide for themselves . '@@ '
at the beginning of October , P@@ ötz@@ l , together with the Bam@@ berg regional building authority , plans to present his plans of development of the college up to 2020 `` and to talk about the importance of the extension work in this context . '@@ '
peer Med@@ au informed the parents of the children '@@ s nur@@ ser@@ y about the plans , last week .
accordingly , the access for the new par@@ king level will not now lead , as before , via the campus and Fried@@ rich@@ -@@ Strei@@ b@@ -@@ Stra@@ sse , but rather via the Med@@ au@@ -@@ Berg .
thus , the narrow road must be widened into two lan@@ es over a stretch of about one kilom@@ et@@ re .
according to higher estimates of the Med@@ aus , the traffic in the Hoh@@ en@@ f@@ els cast@@ le park would increase ten-@@ fold .
they are talking of 2000 vehicles every day .
meanwhile , the town council refused to comment .
G@@ land@@ or@@ f reti@@ res from German National hand@@ ball team
Hol@@ ger G@@ land@@ or@@ f will no longer play for the German National team .
the 31 year-old from German Bundes@@ lig@@ a side S@@ G Fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ Han@@ de@@ wi@@ tt said that it was mainly for health reasons that he had reached this decision .
`` It was not an easy decision to make , but I '@@ ve been thinking about it for months .
the time has come to listen to the signals my body sends and to end my national team career , '@@ ' announced the 2007 World Cup winner on his Face@@ book@@ -@@ P@@ age .
he reti@@ res from international competition with a record of 16@@ 7 national games and 5@@ 76 goals for Germany .
the power@@ ful@@ -@@ throwing right-@@ back wants to continue for the next few years to shoot goals for the Champi@@ ons@@ -L@@ e@@ ague winners from Fl@@ ens@@ burg , and will therefore not be available for selection by new German National team head co@@ ach , D@@ ag@@ ur Si@@ gur@@ d@@ sson .
G@@ land@@ or@@ f said he had had a `` nice long talk '@@ ' with the Icel@@ ander , who will select his squ@@ ad on Tu@@ es@@ day for the games against Switzerland .
his ideas and approach to the game have always inspired me , as I am sure they will also inspire my long-term te@@ amm@@ ates and my successors , too .
`` I would like to represent my club in the next few years and I need longer breaks and more recovery time to do so , and the double burden of also playing for the national team would n@@ '@@ t allow me to do that . '@@ '
the left-@@ h@@ ander feared his career might end in 2012 when he had a he@@ el infection .
due to Achil@@ les ten@@ don problems he was given a cor@@ tis@@ one injec@@ tion by doctors working with the German hand@@ ball Association , and this caused severe s@@ well@@ ing of his foot .
he needed an emergency operation and two further sur@@ geri@@ es as well .
G@@ land@@ or@@ f then brought a legal action against the team doctor ; however , this ended in a settlement .
twelve years as a professional and el@@ even years with the national team would take their toll on any player .
`` I have some health issues I ca n@@ '@@ t ignore anymore .
after three foot@@ -@@ sur@@ geri@@ es within a short period of time in 2012 , caused by infections , I have never been able to control my blood pressure .
I '@@ ve also got some other minor issues related - wear and te@@ ar .
at the beginning of the year I realized that I was able to control my head , but I could n@@ '@@ t play tricks with my body , '@@ ' he explained in an interview with German magazine hand@@ ball Time .
he would only consider a com@@ eback if really necessary .
`` If we are in real big trouble , then I might consider it , '@@ ' the two-@@ time father told the magazine .
`` But I can count the years I will continue to play hand@@ ball with one hand .
and I have to admit that I have become really hum@@ ble after my long stay in the hospital in 2012 , when it comes to my health .
after my career I would like to walk straight , to be honest . '@@ '
besides the 2007 World Champi@@ on@@ ship he also won the Champi@@ ons League in May and the E@@ H@@ F-@@ Cup in 2008 -LRB- HS@@ G Nord@@ hor@@ n -RRB- and 2010 -LRB- TB@@ V L@@ em@@ go -RRB- .
he also won the Cup winners Cup with Fl@@ ens@@ burg in 2012 .
German economy as shrunk by 0.2 percent in spring
the crises around the globe have put a curb on the German economy in the the second quarter .
the Gro@@ ss Dom@@ esti@@ c Pro@@ duc@@ t sank from April to the end of June 2014 by 0.2 percent in comparison with the previous quarter .
this was announced by the German Office for National Statisti@@ cs , which thereby confirmed previous estimates .
consumption alone was a spur to the economy in the early part of the year , wh@@ il@@ st investments were down .
foreign goods trade had slowed , too .
due to the strong start to the year , figures for first half-@@ year GDP were up 0.8 percent from the second quarter of 2013 .
Hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the destination of `` Mün@@ ster@@ land-@@ Mo@@ oi@@ ste , '@@ ' which lead through the city on Sunday .
the city of Hor@@ st@@ mar experienced an invasion of Dutch `` Fi@@ etzen ri@@ ders '@@ ' on Sunday .
the largest cy@@ cling federation in Holland , NT@@ F@@ U , staged the so-called `` Mün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de-@@ Mo@@ oi@@ ste . '@@ '
in other words , the largest bi@@ ke ride straight through Mün@@ ster@@ land , a bi@@ ke ri@@ der '@@ s par@@ adise close to Holland .
by regi@@ stering , more than 1000 participants thank@@ ed J@@ os ter Hu@@ erne for having organized this tour through Mün@@ ster@@ land .
the tour was adverti@@ sed in several professional journals , and offered to those interested .
we are from Den Hel@@ der , and drove here over night so we could take part in the tour .
we would also like to get know Mün@@ ster@@ land a bit better in the same way , '@@ ' the cycli@@ sts eagerly said , looking forward to the route through St@@ einf@@ ur@@ t , Bor@@ ken and Co@@ es@@ feld .
after regi@@ stering at the frat@@ ernity '@@ s club house , St@@ a .
Kath@@ ar@@ ina started off with a small `` peace ride '@@ ' through the city and over the Em@@ bank@@ ment , which is also where the start line was .
then , the route , which was adverti@@ sed in three different categories , headed in the direction of Her@@ ren@@ hol@@ z via Sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger Berg towards Co@@ es@@ feld , passing by H@@ avi@@ x@@ be@@ ck and Bil@@ ler@@ be@@ ck , and then back to Hor@@ st@@ mar .
the ri@@ ders prove just how good a shape they are in : stret@@ ches of 95 kilometers at an al@@ titude of 1@@ 17@@ 5 meters , 120 kilometers with an al@@ titude of 14@@ 75 meters , and 1@@ 45 kilometers with an al@@ titude of 17@@ 75 meters .
they were fed and water@@ ed on their way back in H@@ avi@@ x@@ be@@ ck and Bil@@ ler@@ be@@ ck .
chief organi@@ zer , J@@ os ter Hu@@ erne , and deputy mayor , H@@ ein@@ z L@@ öl@@ fing seemed to be very pleased with the success of this cy@@ cling event .
we are happy , and it was a wonderful experience for all participants .
the organization went smoothly , with no issues , and there were no nasty incidents , '@@ ' H@@ ein@@ z L@@ öl@@ fing positively concluded with regard to the event .
unfortunately , there were not as many participants as the organi@@ zer had hoped for , which is presumably because of the bad weather forecast and the morning rain .
`` We shall see each other in 2015 , hop@@ efully with nice weather , on either 30 August , or on another weekend , '@@ ' the ri@@ ders promised , but whatever the weather , they will return to Mün@@ ster@@ land , and the organizers will plan a repeat .
Kon@@ stanti@@ n W@@ ec@@ ker - scrupul@@ ously honest memoirs
the 2@@ 8@@ 7-@@ page `` mon@@ k and warri@@ or '@@ ' by Kon@@ stanti@@ n W@@ ec@@ ker , song writer , paci@@ f@@ ist , political activist and ex-@@ prisoner , is really more a statement of philosophy than it is a bio@@ graphy
composed more as a collection of thou@@ ght-@@ provoking ideas rather than a chron@@ ological history , the author , who was born in Munich on 1 June 1947 , has provided every chapter with an accompanying suitable son@@ g-@@ text .
and he has been un@@ stin@@ tingly honest throughout : from ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ating as a gra@@ m@@ mar school pu@@ pi@@ l to sh@@ op@@ lifting and drug-@@ taking , he has left none of his human weaknesses un@@ told .
and this was also a means to explain why he is now come to be so tolerant towards his fellow man .
as a result , abstract concepts , which he liber@@ ally uses throughout the text , take on a clearer , more important meaning : love ; soul ; e@@ go ; existing in the H@@ ere and Now ; spiritu@@ ality - he seeks to understand the essential meaning of these concepts , in a highly philosophical , but also very personal way .
and he explains why he is paci@@ f@@ ist ; what lies behind his criticism of society ; his political heart and soul ; and also how his thoughts and ideas have been shaped and m@@ oul@@ ded - not only by music -LRB- he was an opera lover who became a soul and rock musi@@ cian -RRB- but by his prison experience , too .
he says that the latter experience gave him a closer understanding of the life of the monks , who live their lives by a process of `` sub@@ traction '@@ ' whereby they `` rid themselves of all things super@@ flu@@ ous . '@@ '
in-@@ between all the high@@ bro@@ w stuff , there are also short an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es of a more ear@@ thy nature - for example , fi@@ st-@@ fights in a bar frequ@@ ented by G@@ Is , or else a crazy drive on the mot@@ or@@ way , in which he drove full-@@ on straight into a tree .
and he '@@ s un@@ spar@@ ing also , as he describes that too .
Len@@ ny Henry : my father never hu@@ gged me .
never said `` I love you '@@ '
Henry was one of seven children born to Jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an immigrants in Du@@ d@@ ley in the Mi@@ d@@ lands in 1958 .
his father , who died when Henry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry is re@@ hear@@ sing a com@@ edy , Ru@@ dy '@@ s rare records , which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series .
the sound@@ track is a mix of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p and the tun@@ es are up@@ beat .
but Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood .
there was `` a lot '@@ ' of therapy after his mother died and Henry is reflec@@ tive about his relationship with his father .
he was very unk@@ now@@ able .
you never saw his face , you just heard his voice : ` St@@ op the no@@ ise .
leave your sister alone .
move !
I want to watch the cricket .
my older brothers Se@@ y@@ mo@@ ur and Hil@@ ton - who were grow@@ n@@ -up when I was a k@@ id - went to the pu@@ b with him and talked about things like the shape of the be@@ er glass , the beauty of the stroke in cricket .
I never had a conversation with him like that .
he was this uns@@ mi@@ ling blo@@ ke in the corner , reading the paper for a lot of my life .
recently Henry opened a found@@ ry in Du@@ d@@ ley and , although conditions were better than in his father '@@ s day , he got a sn@@ ap@@ shot of what life must have been like for him .
it '@@ s a bit bri@@ ghter now but they '@@ re dark , smo@@ ky , St@@ y@@ gi@@ an lab@@ y@@ rin@@ th@@ ine dep@@ ths with bur@@ sts of fl@@ ame and smoke and lots of so@@ ot .
my dad used to get in the b@@ ath and just lie there and you '@@ d hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would w@@ ash the found@@ ry off him .
when I walked round it , I realis@@ ed that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table , and my estim@@ ation of him went up .
none the less , Henry emerged from a childhood stripped of par@@ ental aff@@ ection .
my dad never did hu@@ gging , never said , ` I love you ' .
it was n@@ '@@ t until my m@@ um was poorly near the end of her life that we started saying ` I love you , I love you , I love you .
having a daughter of his own , Billi@@ e , with Da@@ wn French , enabled him to share the love he missed as a child .
could you stop with the `` I love you '@@ ' ?
just stop hu@@ gging me !
dad , I '@@ m 22 !
with Da@@ wn French .
why would n@@ '@@ t I be friends with her ?
she '@@ s a great m@@ um
he '@@ s still very good friends with French , to whom he was married for 25 years .
dawn '@@ s a good person .
why would n@@ '@@ t I be friends with Da@@ wn ?
she '@@ s a great m@@ um .
Henry '@@ s own mother was di@@ ab@@ e@@ tic .
it was one of the things that killed her .
so when I became very , very over@@ weight and started getting di@@ ab@@ e@@ tic symptoms , my doctor said , ` You '@@ ve got to be radical .
so I went on a big fit@@ ness thing , and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it '@@ s very hard .
and it '@@ s te@@ dious .
nobody likes eating carrots .
Henry '@@ s change in career trajectory is , perhaps , reflected in his distinguished , clo@@ se-@@ cro@@ pped be@@ ard .
since he won critical acc@@ laim for his O@@ th@@ ell@@ o , he has become en@@ gro@@ ssed in the the@@ at@@ re .
com@@ edy of errors followed , as did f@@ ences by August Wilson .
it '@@ s a different experience from the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ e@@ dies that have uph@@ ol@@ stered his busy working life .
he started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory .
a D@@ J spot@@ ted him on stage doing im@@ pressions and wrote to New F@@ aces about him .
his TV career was launched in the mid-@@ S@@ even@@ ties : `` For quite a long time I was the only black im@@ pres@@ sion@@ ist@@ /@@ com@@ edi@@ an on tel@@ ly . '@@ '
he lear@@ nt on the job .
not only did I have to grow up in the public eye , I had to learn how to be an efficient j@@ ok@@ e-@@ delivering mechanism between 1975 and 1985 , wh@@ il@@ st being a star , being on television and it was really difficult .
Len@@ ny on New F@@ aces in 1975
because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Min@@ stre@@ l S@@ how , a light entertainment programme in which people `` black@@ ed up , '@@ ' Henry found himself performing his com@@ edy in it for five years .
my family were very uncomfortable about it .
I sort of wish it had never happened , but I do n@@ '@@ t regret that I did it .
although it was a wei@@ r@@ d , re@@ prehen@@ sible position to be in , I was working in huge ven@@ ues and learning how to work a crowd .
but what was an `` awar@@ d-@@ winning light entertainment staple of British television for years and years '@@ ' was also a `` grotes@@ que par@@ ody of black people . '@@ '
introducing charac@@ ters who both lam@@ po@@ oned and celebrated black British culture , Henry worked on the alternative com@@ edy circu@@ it in the eigh@@ ties .
the first series of The Len@@ ny Henry S@@ how aired in 1984 , and in the N@@ ine@@ ties he was known as , among other things , chef G@@ are@@ th Black@@ lock in the com@@ edy series chef ! .
advertis@@ ements , docum@@ ent@@ aries , TV series and parts in films consumed his next decade but after his 2008 BBC series , Len@@ n@@ y@@ Hen@@ ry@@ .@@ t@@ v , he thought : `` What are you going to do next , L@@ en , because it all feels a bit like you '@@ re marking time or you '@@ re slightly going side@@ ways . '@@ '
what came next was a Radio 4 documentary series called What '@@ s So Great Ab@@ out ... ?
the first was on Shakespeare .
I had a real aller@@ gy to Shakespeare .
I was n@@ '@@ t really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of middle-class white people with ti@@ ghts and a cab@@ bage down the front .
so I was very frightened of it .
everybody we inter@@ viewed on that show , Peter H@@ all , Tre@@ vor N@@ un@@ n , A@@ dri@@ an L@@ ester , Ju@@ di Den@@ ch , said , ` You should try it .
do n@@ '@@ t s@@ lag it off if you do n@@ '@@ t know what you '@@ re talking about .
get some of the words in your mouth and then you '@@ ll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much .
Henry delivered 20 lines of O@@ th@@ ell@@ o '@@ s last speech for the documentary and he was ho@@ oked .
it gave me the feeling that I could do it .
it '@@ s almost like I had my head put on straight for me .
` This is what it '@@ s about , it '@@ s a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your lines , do some research .
so the re@@ hear@@ sal process was brutal and I was reading that play for months and months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car crash and it did n@@ '@@ t quite happen .
soon he was star@@ ring in com@@ edy of errors .
suddenly I '@@ m at the National the@@ at@@ re and I just could n@@ '@@ t quite believe it .
there was one moment where I thought , ` O@@ h , you '@@ ve changed . '@@ ' '@@ '
there was a technical fault and Henry instinc@@ tively felt that it was his job to keep the audience enter@@ tained .
`` A little voice inside me said , ` You '@@ re going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer . '@@ ' '@@ '
instead , the stage manager announced the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved .
I walked off the stage and something in me went , `` O@@ h , thank God . '@@ '
it '@@ s not my responsibility .
I can let somebody else sort it out .
` You '@@ re in a play , stay in character . '@@ ' '@@ '
Henry appearing in f@@ ences at the Du@@ chess the@@ at@@ re
learning his lines for f@@ ences was challenging .
panic '@@ s quite good , it sti@@ ff@@ ens the sin@@ e@@ ws .
that was well received too , so it '@@ s like a big sign from the go@@ ds , saying , ` This is what you should be doing . '@@ ' '@@ '
he says this , of course , in a booming voice .
so I '@@ m sticking with it .
I '@@ m really loving it .
I love being in a re@@ hear@@ sal room .
Henry still has a com@@ edi@@ an '@@ s brain , though - throughout , our conversation is broken with fl@@ ashes of his hu@@ mo@@ ur as he sli@@ ps in and out of im@@ pressions .
I '@@ m just choosing not to do stand@@ -up because that thing of getting instant gra@@ tification from a room full of strangers I guess is kind of dangerous .
if you '@@ re constantly seeking that it can lead to a brick wall .
I do Live at the A@@ poll@@ o sometimes when I want to , but generally it does n@@ '@@ t float my boat like it used to .
I ask whether he '@@ ll ever do another stand@@ -up tour .
the joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning , middle and end of a journey - I do n@@ '@@ t think I '@@ ll ever want to give that up .
so this is his new incar@@ nation ?
I think so .
I like being an actor .
it '@@ s good fun .
you '@@ re always telling a story and that '@@ s a great place to be .
I love stories .
people love stories .
Hou@@ th@@ i rebels block roads in Yemeni capital
in the conflict between the Shiite Hou@@ th@@ i rebels and the Yemen government , the Hou@@ this have called for civil di@@ so@@ be@@ dience in the capital , San@@ a@@ a .
Hou@@ th@@ i supporters had occupied central roads in San@@ a@@ a on Mon@@ day , said a spokesman of the Hou@@ th@@ i party `` An@@ s@@ ar Allah . '@@ '
access to the parliament was blocked as well .
Yemeni media report that there is traffic chaos in the capital .
according to a report in the on-@@ line edi@@ tion of the newspaper `` Yemen Post '@@ ' Hou@@ th@@ i leader Abdul@@ mali@@ k al-@@ Hu@@ th@@ i called for these actions on Sunday evening .
the report said that Hu@@ th@@ i threatened further escalation of the conflict , should his demands not be met .
the Shiite Hou@@ this are fighting for more independence f@@ ro the Sunni-@@ ruled Yemen , and are demanding that the government resign .
according to the report , Hou@@ th@@ i tribes have been besie@@ ging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks .
around 30,000 rebels had set up protest camps on the major access routes to San@@ a@@ a .
in the surrounding areas of the town , bloody clashes with the Yemeni army have continued unabated .
Kenya regi@@ sters civil servants to target ` gh@@ ost workers '
Kenya has started biom@@ etri@@ cally regi@@ stering all civil servants in an attempt to remove `` gh@@ ost workers '@@ ' from the government '@@ s payroll .
employees who failed to register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid , a government statement said .
the government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service .
President U@@ hur@@ u Keny@@ att@@ a pledged to curb corruption in the public service after taking office in 2013 .
an audi@@ t earlier this year found that at least $ 1@@ m -LRB- £ 70@@ 0,000 -RRB- a month was lost in payments to `` gh@@ ost workers '@@ ' and other financial mal@@ practice .
the government suspects that salaries continue to be deposi@@ ted into bank accounts , even after a person dies or leaves the public service , reports the BBC '@@ s W@@ any@@ ama Che@@ bu@@ si@@ ri from the capital , Nairobi .
all public servants are required to present themselves over the next two weeks at identification cent@@ res to ensure their data is captured through the biom@@ etri@@ c registration exercise , a government statement said .
anyone who failed to do so without a valid excuse would be eliminated from the payroll , it said .
`` This exercise will contribute significantly to the ration@@ alization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to clean@@ se the payroll at both levels of govern@@ ment@@ - hence bring a stop to the issue of ` gh@@ ost workers ' , '@@ ' said An@@ ne W@@ ai@@ gur@@ u , the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of de@@ volution and Plan@@ ning .

children need roots and wings
he was a school teacher for 44 years , 23 of which he was the principal .
during his teaching time , Man@@ fre@@ d Richter got to know many school@@ children who are now ful@@ ly-@@ grown adults living in Pe@@ ter@@ sh@@ au@@ sen and Koll@@ b@@ ach .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but they were always based on his desire to see the adult in the child .
mount S@@ n@@ ě@@ ž@@ ka is one of the best-@@ known pe@@ aks in the Czech giant Mo@@ un@@ tains .
Man@@ fre@@ d Richter lo@@ ves this pain@@ ting of a picture from his childhood home .
Richter was born in 1930 in Trau@@ ten@@ au@@ /@@ Nord@@ b@@ öh@@ men , today '@@ s Tru@@ t@@ no@@ v .
he was interested in becoming a teacher as early as the age of 14 , after he had been a secondary school pu@@ pi@@ l for four years .
one year later the Germans living in the Su@@ deten@@ land were dis@@ possessed .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their home .
after a few months spent in a holding camp , they moved to Bav@@ aria in 1946 - in a goods train .
that was how he came to live in Sen@@ ken@@ dor@@ f , in U@@ pper Fran@@ con@@ ia .
the teacher training course was in Bam@@ berg .
in order to get to the school , Man@@ fre@@ d Richter had to go six times per week on foot to the near@@ est train station ; take the train to Bam@@ berg ; from there walk three kilom@@ et@@ res right across the town to the school ; and then make the return journey home .
after two months . Man@@ fre@@ d Richter was given a bed to sleep at the Red Cro@@ ss Home in Bam@@ berg , in a sle@@ eping quarter that he shared with 15 fellow students .
in 1951 , he took his first state ex@@ am , and his second in 1954 , after spending three further years as a teaching candidate .
since U@@ pper Fran@@ con@@ ia had no free teaching place for him , he applied to U@@ pper Bav@@ aria and received a post on 1 November 1954 at a school in Koll@@ b@@ ach .
the `` Young Women '@@ s Ro@@ om '@@ ' was his first `` Service Fl@@ at '@@ ' in the school building .
in 1958 , he moved into the new@@ -@@ build teacher accommodation next door to the school , into a three-@@ room service flat .
Man@@ fre@@ d Richter bought this house in 1980 , after the school in Koll@@ b@@ ach was closed in 1968 .
until then , the school district association of Pe@@ ter@@ sh@@ aus@@ en-@@ Koll@@ b@@ ach had three classes in Koll@@ b@@ ach and five in Pe@@ ter@@ sh@@ au@@ sen .
in the school year of 196@@ 8@@ /@@ 69 , these classes were accommod@@ ated in Pe@@ ter@@ sh@@ au@@ sen , in today '@@ s town hall .
when the In@@ der@@ s@@ dor@@ f schools Association was founded , the only school left in the loc@@ ality was the primary school .
in order to avoid a der@@ ank@@ ing of position in the now smaller school , the then dean , Geor@@ g Si@@ g@@ l decided to move to Kar@@ l@@ sf@@ eld - and Man@@ fre@@ d Richter became his successor .
however , Pe@@ ter@@ sh@@ au@@ sen continued to grow , and so the children and their teachers , from September 1982 on@@ wards , could move into the pres@@ ent-@@ day building , which has since been extended , after Richter took his retirement .
Man@@ fre@@ d Richter prais@@ es the un@@ complicated manner and spirit of generosity of the then Mayor , Ludwig G@@ ö@@ tz , who was able to secure municipal funds to build an additional work@@ -@@ room and extra rooms in the cell@@ ar as part of the 1997 exten@@ sions - although the council guidelines governing school@@ -building work did not allow subsidies to be used to pay for this work .
`` Mayor G@@ ö@@ tz was a great friend of the school , '@@ ' recalls Richter , with gra@@ titude .
throughout his whole career , Man@@ fre@@ d Richter never for@@ got a reply given in a speech by a government representative , in answer to a pres@@ entation given by the schools council on law and justice : `` One should never forget to love . '@@ ' Man@@ fre@@ d Richter duly implemented what he had heard as a young teacher .
`` One has to give children two things : roots and wings , '@@ ' says the 84 year-old .
but experience has also taught him that : `` One does n@@ '@@ t always achieve that . '@@ ' W@@ he@@ ther by that he means his pup@@ ils or his own six children , is unclear .
in any case , Richter '@@ s methods were at times unconventional .
if school children got into fights , they were not given puni@@ shments like , for example , writing out lines or serving a detention .
at the cost of the council , Richter bought two pairs of box@@ ing glo@@ ves , and then let the two antagoni@@ sts fight it out , even if this did occasionally produce a black@@ -@@ eye .
for the benefit of the school , Richter nurtured a good relationship with the then Mayor , Ludwig G@@ ö@@ tz -LRB- CSU -RRB- .
following his retirement , Richter , who had no political allegi@@ ances , was encouraged by the Mayor to run for election onto the local council as a candidate for the CSU in 1996 .
however , Richter finished in sixth and joined the CSU .
180 kilom@@ et@@ res in three days
H@@ R@@ 4-@@ C@@ Y@@ C@@ L@@ E tour 700 cycli@@ sts are taking a brea@@ ther in the health resort of Bad Sal@@ z@@ hau@@ sen and Sch@@ otten
there is nothing particular out of the ordinary about to@@ uring cycli@@ sts take a rest in Bad Sal@@ z@@ hau@@ sen or in Sch@@ otten .
however , on Fri@@ day , the sheer numbers of those re@@ sting up was striking : the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycle tour , together with their ent@@ our@@ ages , were all enjoying a break in the lower resort of Bad Sal@@ z@@ hau@@ sen , and they would later be attending an open air party in the Al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park in Sch@@ otten , too .
under the lo@@ go `` cy@@ cling and celebrating along the new@@ ly-@@ discovered routes between Ni@@ d@@ da and Kin@@ zig , '@@ ' the participants had met up on Th@@ urs@@ day in Bad Vil@@ bel and had listened to a concert there by Van Baker & band .
on Fri@@ day it was down to business : the ri@@ ders set out to attack the first stage - 60 kilom@@ et@@ res via Flor@@ stadt to Bad Sal@@ z@@ hau@@ sen and then further on to Sch@@ otten .
in Bad Sal@@ z@@ hau@@ sen , the spor@@ ts@@ men@@ -and-@@ women were greeted by mayor H@@ ans@@ -@@ Peter Se@@ um , who had ridden off the start-@@ line in Bad Vil@@ bel on his own bi@@ ke , and the boss of the municipal company Bad Sal@@ z@@ hau@@ sen , Pet@@ ra Schw@@ ing-@@ Dör@@ ing .
all sorts of food and drink had been prepared , to re@@ fresh body and mind : the local women from Ran@@ stadt and Nieder@@ -@@ Mo@@ ck@@ stadt had bak@@ ed 85 app@@ le@@ - , plum@@ - and che@@ es@@ ec@@ akes - as well as stre@@ us@@ el c@@ ake which the in@@ tre@@ pid ri@@ ders let melt in their mou@@ ths .
`` Su@@ ch c@@ akes only the local women can make , '@@ ' praised the ri@@ der from A@@ ul@@ en@@ die@@ b@@ ach , at the same time as he ordered another slice .
at the drin@@ ks stand of the Geiß@@ -@@ Ni@@ d@@ da g@@ ym@@ n@@ asi@@ um club , the ri@@ ders could acquire cold drin@@ ks .
the `` du@@ o Bra@@ vo '@@ ' enter@@ tained the visitors with well-known mel@@ o@@ dies from Oper@@ ett@@ as and Musi@@ cals and re@@ ap@@ ed enthusiastic applau@@ se .
the lo@@ vely atmosphere in the Park had a relax@@ ing effect .
one gent@@ leman even received a head@@ -@@ mass@@ age from his la@@ dy partner : `` He certainly earned it - after all , he had to fix a bicy@@ cle chain that had come off , earlier in the day . '@@ '
meanwhile , the mayor and the company boss still had work to do : they were inter@@ viewed at the fo@@ un@@ tain in front of the water@@ ing-@@ hole In@@ n , the Trink@@ kur@@ haus , by repor@@ ter , R@@ ain@@ er J@@ anke , and took their radio opportunity to give a big thum@@ bs up for Bad Sal@@ z@@ hau@@ sen .
even head of promo@@ tions , To@@ bias Ha@@ gen , who had worked as tour head since it first started in 2004 , could only get a short rest , as he had a lot of work to do involving the local technology .
his p@@ ick@@ -up truck , in which he used three teleph@@ ones and a radio to communicate with his colleagues and a 15-@@ strong H@@ essen Poli@@ ce team ; made Facebook ent@@ ries and also wrote his reports , also needed a check .
`` The majority of ri@@ ders come from the R@@ hein@@ -@@ Ma@@ in-@@ Region , '@@ ' he explained , `` but ri@@ ders have also come from G@@ ie@@ ßen and F@@ ul@@ da , from Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ ach or from the Ta@@ un@@ us and even from many towns in West@@ f@@ alia .
the number of participants depends a little on the number of places where they can stay .
category 1 ri@@ ders are accommod@@ ated in hotels , with Cat@@ eg@@ ory 2 ri@@ ders being put up in ho@@ st@@ el-@@ style lo@@ dging .
as the ri@@ ders set out again on the road , they had a good impression and happy memories of the resort : `` B@@ ye ! '@@ '
`` It was very nice in Bad Sal@@ z@@ hau@@ sen ! '@@ ' they sh@@ ou@@ ted , as they wa@@ ved good@@ by@@ e .
after arriving in Sch@@ otten , the group could take a short rest .
but then in the evening , the ri@@ ders were requested to go to the i@@ dy@@ lli@@ c Al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .
under the guidance of manager of the Sch@@ otten Association for Tour@@ ism and T@@ own marketing -LRB- G@@ T@@ S -RRB- the Park had acquired a lo@@ vely fes@@ tive ambi@@ ence and , of course , there were plenty of nice ni@@ b@@ bles , such as Fl@@ amm@@ ku@@ chen with well-@@ chil@@ led Feder@@ wei@@ ßer w@@ ine , too .
May@@ or@@ ess Sus@@ an@@ ne Sch@@ a@@ ab , G@@ T@@ S@@ -@@ boss , Mark@@ us Ho@@ ß@@ feld and M@@ SC@@ -@@ Chairman , Wolfgang Wag@@ ner@@ -@@ Sachs , in his capacity as board member of the H@@ essen@@ -@@ Th@@ ür@@ ingen section of the AD@@ AC welcomed the visitors .
the three were visibly deli@@ ghted by the `` ro@@ aring trade in Sch@@ otten . '@@ '
D@@ J To@@ bias Ha@@ gen opened the dan@@ cing stage .
the cycli@@ sts were happy to have the chance to show off their dan@@ cing movements in the open air - despite their spor@@ ting fe@@ ats on their bicy@@ cles earlier in the day .
the appeared among the gu@@ ests an increasing number of local people , who were as attracted by the pleasant atmosphere as much as the mass crowd of ri@@ ders .
on the second day of the tour program , the ri@@ ders would call at the stopping points of Bir@@ stein ; Wäch@@ ters@@ b@@ ach ; and Bad Or@@ b - including a concert with the Tren@@ k@@ wal@@ dern .
yesterday , after 180 kilom@@ et@@ res of cy@@ cling , the spor@@ ts@@ men@@ -and-@@ women arrived back in Bad Vil@@ bel once again .
tens of Turkish policemen arrested over ` plot@@ ting ' against Go@@ v@@ '@@ t
a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicions of ` plot@@ ting against the government ' , local media outlets say .
police officials have not immediately comm@@ ented .
among the detainees were 14 high-@@ ranking officers , according to Hurri@@ yet Daily News .
some of them were involved in last December '@@ s corruption prob@@ es targeting government officials , including four government ministers .
in July a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly having set up an organized criminal gang and having t@@ apped phone number .
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -LRB- who was Prime Minister back then -RRB- described their actions as part of activity conducted by Islamist cleric F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gul@@ len against him and others in power .
not all children back to school in Ukraine
schools across most of Ukraine re@@ opened their doors on Mon@@ day -LRB- September 1 -RRB- , after the summer holi@@ days .
the day is traditionally a big one for families , and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Arsen@@ y Y@@ at@@ sen@@ y@@ uk took his daughter to school .
while there , he told waiting journalists that not all schools had re@@ opened , but that he was committed to defending the country for future generations :
the first of September ceremony was not held in every school .
there is not a peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of Ukraine , a huge joint Ukrainian '@@ s people '@@ s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
Aleks@@ an Past@@ uk@@ ho@@ v , the head teacher of S@@ lavi@@ ans@@ k School , attended by Y@@ at@@ sen@@ y@@ uk '@@ s daughter , spoke in Russian .
we hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives .
the first day back at school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered shir@@ ts , carrying ballo@@ ons and giving flo@@ wers to their teachers .
in R@@ ona Fair@@ head , the BBC may have found the formidable chief it needs
she comes tra@@ iling clouds of glory from the world of banking , media management and the inner conc@@ la@@ ves of the T@@ ory party .
indeed , she has had front@@ line experience of her own .
her career began at global management consult@@ ants B@@ ain and C@@ o , then progre@@ ssed via Morgan Stanley , Bom@@ b@@ adi@@ er , IC@@ I and the media world of Pear@@ sons .
she was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years , re@@ signing when the top job at its parent company Pear@@ son '@@ s went to a junior male colleague .
her pa@@ y-@@ off is said to be close to £ 1 million .
her political rating is stur@@ dy , too .
she was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Bro@@ w@@ ne , the former head of BP , when he was looking to bring private expertise into Wh@@ it@@ eh@@ all : she became a cabinet office adviser .
her husband is a former T@@ ory coun@@ ci@@ ll@@ or .
back in May , I described the chairman '@@ s job as a poisoned ch@@ al@@ ice .
not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is an inner paradox to its structure .
the trust faces in two directions : in@@ wards as the upper tier of the BBC '@@ s own management hierarchy , but also out@@ wards as the voice of public concern and dis@@ quiet when things go aw@@ ry .
this is an almost untenable du@@ opo@@ ly calling for complete ro@@ ot@@ -and-@@ branch reform .
but what incoming chairman would risk coming in , cra@@ shing around and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty in case they put themselves out of a job in the process .
it '@@ s a difficult call .
if that were n@@ '@@ t tough enough , plenty of people are keen to see the BBC cut down in size - its power , its finances and its status overhau@@ led .
as competitors circle ever closer and new technology challenges co@@ sy old certain@@ ties , the imminent negotiation of the L@@ ic@@ ence fee is fraught with espec@@ ial danger for the BBC .
for the modest sum of £ 14@@ 5.@@ 50 a year , the British public buys into what is surely the greatest media enterprise in the world .
the BBC tells a good story : it claims that its output reaches 96 per cent of households , and costs each one of them just 40@@ p a day .
what '@@ s more , apparently the Be@@ eb '@@ s popularity is rising : 53 per cent support today as against 31 per cent 10 years ago .
patterns of watching and using the BBC have changed : I receive news headlines on my mobile phone these days , and catch up on missed program@@ mes with i@@ Player .
but it remains a much-@@ loved and formidable institution .
it needs a formidable chairman - I hope it has found one .
Texas ' Perry says dispar@@ aging t@@ we@@ et un@@ authorized
a t@@ we@@ et from Republican Texas Go@@ v. R@@ ick Perry '@@ s veri@@ fied account on Sunday night included a dispar@@ aging image of the Democratic district att@@ or@@ ney who is at the center of his criminal indictment on charges of abuse of power .
the t@@ we@@ et was later del@@ eted , followed by another from Perry '@@ s account that dis@@ avo@@ wed the post .
a t@@ we@@ et just went out from my account that was un@@ authorized .
`` I do not con@@ done the t@@ we@@ et and I have taken it down , '@@ ' the later post said .
Perry aides did not immediately return messages seeking comment .
although the t@@ we@@ ets were sent from Perry '@@ s veri@@ fied account , it was unclear who does the actual post@@ ing for the feed .
the earlier t@@ we@@ et post@@ ed an un@@ flat@@ tering mo@@ ck image of Tra@@ vis Coun@@ ty Di@@ strict At@@ tor@@ ney Ros@@ em@@ ary Leh@@ m@@ berg , who was convicted of dr@@ unken driving in April 2013 .
Perry veto@@ ed funds to her office when she refused to resign , which led to a grand jury in Aus@@ tin this month indic@@ ting Perry - who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate .
the cap@@ tion on the t@@ we@@ et reads : `` I do n@@ '@@ t always drive dr@@ unk at 3@@ x the legal blood alcohol limit ... but when I do , I indic@@ t Go@@ v. Perry for calling me out about it . '@@ '
I am the most dr@@ unk Democrat in Texas .
Leh@@ m@@ berg '@@ s office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Perry .
it was handled by Michael McC@@ rum , a San Antoni@@ o-@@ based special prosecutor who was assigned by a Republican judge .
Perry has p@@ lead@@ ed not guilty and called the charges a political plo@@ y .
his high-@@ powered legal team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the indictment , claiming that the law being used to prosecute the lon@@ gest@@ -@@ serving governor in Texas history is un@@ constitu@@ tionally vague .
Perry cut off $ 7.5 million in state funds to the state '@@ s Public Inte@@ gri@@ ty Uni@@ t - which is based in Tra@@ vis Coun@@ ty and prosec@@ utes public corruption in Texas - when Leh@@ m@@ berg refused to resign .
that veto drew a formal compla@@ int from a left-@@ leaning watchdog group .
Perry '@@ s veri@@ fied account is updated frequently - and sometimes famously .
after fini@@ shing in fifth place in the I@@ owa cau@@ c@@ uses during his 2012 presidential campaign , Perry addressed speculation that he might call it qu@@ its with a t@@ we@@ et of a photo of himself jo@@ gging near a la@@ ke , and the words , `` H@@ ere we come South Car@@ ol@@ ina ! '@@ '
Berkeley says housing market back to `` normal '@@ '
one of London '@@ s most prominent property developers has warned that the housing market in sou@@ theast England has `` rever@@ ted '@@ ' to normal levels of activity .
homes in the capital have been the subject of red-@@ hot demand and surging prices , with widespread fears of a credit bubble prompting the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage borrowing in June .
Tony Pi@@ dg@@ ley , founder and chairman of up@@ market hou@@ se@@ buil@@ der Berkeley , on Mon@@ day said : `` Since the start of the current financial year , the market has rever@@ ted to normal transaction levels from the high point in 2013 , '@@ ' adding that this offered a `` stable operating environment . '@@ '
London '@@ s property market fared well during the downturn as foreign buyers p@@ iled into the capital .
prices in the city have le@@ apt 18@@ .5 per cent in the past year alone , according to Land regi@@ stry data , far out@@ stri@@ pping the 6.@@ 7 per cent average for England and W@@ ales as a whole .
average selling prices on Berkeley '@@ s private , affordable and student schemes have risen by about a fifth in the past year , reaching £ 4@@ 2@@ 3,000 at the end of April .
however , a strengthening pound has in recent months made London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential `` man@@ sion tax '@@ ' ahead of the general election next May .
London estate agent Fo@@ x@@ tons last week warned that April '@@ s mortgage Market Review , which introduced tougher lending rules , would also spark lower rates of market growth in both property sales transactions and prices during the second half of the year .
fresh data from the Bank of England on Mon@@ day showed a drop in the number of mortgage appro@@ vals in July , further suggesting the housing market is cooling .
H@@ amp@@ tons International , another estate agent , has cut its 2015 forecast for London property price growth to 3 per cent on the basis that house price sentiment is already starting to weaken .
transaction volumes have meanwhile dropped by a quarter year on year in London '@@ s most expensive post@@ codes , such as Chelsea , May@@ fair and Ken@@ sing@@ ton , according to agent wa E@@ lli@@ s .
still , appetite for homes in the capital has been a boon to Berkeley , pushing up cash due on forward sales to more than £ 2.@@ 2@@ bn .
Mr Pi@@ dg@@ ley added : `` demand for the right product with good design in the best locations has remained resilient and , reflecting this , forward sales have been maintained . '@@ '
in June the company reported it had sold 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007 .
annual pre-@@ tax profits rose 40 per cent year on year to £ 3@@ 80@@ m , on revenues up 18 per cent to £ 1.@@ 6@@ bn .
speaking on Mon@@ day ahead of the company '@@ s annual meeting , Mr Pi@@ dg@@ ley said Berkeley '@@ s earnings for the year were anticipated to be in line with current market expectations .
analyst consensus is for full-@@ year pre-@@ tax profit of £ 4@@ 50@@ m .
Berkeley shares were flat at £ 2@@ 3.@@ 96 in after@@ no@@ on London trading .
nu@@ de photos of J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence leaked online by hack@@ er
J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence arrives at the 8@@ 5@@ th annual Academy A@@ wards .
nu@@ de photos of Osc@@ ar-@@ winning ac@@ tress J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence have been leaked online by a hack@@ er who claimed to have a `` master list '@@ ' of images of 100 other star@@ lets .
a representative for the star of `` The Hunger Games '@@ ' confirmed the photos of Lawrence were real and b@@ lasted the hack@@ er for `` a fla@@ grant violation of privacy . '@@ '
the authorities have been cont@@ acted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence .
the photos , which originally were post@@ ed on the ima@@ ge-@@ sharing site 4@@ ch@@ an , were pur@@ portedly obtained through a weakness in Apple '@@ s i@@ C@@ loud online storage system , and a pur@@ por@@ ted `` master list '@@ ' of the hack@@ ing victims includes the names of dozens of female stars , including R@@ ih@@ anna , Kim Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an , M@@ ary Elizabeth W@@ instead and Mar@@ y-@@ K@@ ate Ol@@ sen , according to Bu@@ zz@@ Fe@@ ed .
it is not clear how many of the images are authenti@@ c , though `` Scot@@ t pil@@ grim v@@ s. the World '@@ ' star W@@ instead took to Twitter to denounce the h@@ ack as well .
`` To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home , hope you feel great about your@@ selves , '@@ ' W@@ instead t@@ we@@ eted .
however , Victoria Justice , of the N@@ ick@@ olo@@ de@@ on series `` i@@ C@@ arly '@@ ' and `` victorious , '@@ ' denied that the photos were of her , t@@ we@@ eting , `` These so called nu@@ des of me are f@@ ake people .

they dissolved , that was the best way of putting it , they gradually came apart like a car@@ d@@ board box that had been left out in the rain .
just occasionally a woman told him he was too serious , hard-@@ going , intense , det@@ ached , and maybe a bit pri@@ ck@@ ly .
and then sho@@ ok his hand .
he recogni@@ sed pri@@ ck@@ ly .
he was sp@@ in@@ y , like a hed@@ ge@@ ho@@ g , yes .
the latest casu@@ alty of this sp@@ in@@ iness was an em@@ br@@ yo@@ -@@ affair that had given greater promise than usual of reliev@@ ing the lon@@ ely te@@ dium of his life , and perhaps even bringing him some content .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons was a wil@@ d-@@ ha@@ i@@ red , qui@@ ver@@ ingly delicate beauty with a flut@@ tering heart from a northern island village more remote and ru@@ gged even than Port Re@@ u@@ ben .
she had come south with an older compani@@ on whom K@@ ever@@ n took to be her aun@@ t , the latter having been left a property in a we@@ t but para@@ dis@@ al val@@ ley called , fe@@ lic@@ it@@ ously , Par@@ adise Valley .
no one had lived in the house for several years .
the pi@@ pes leaked , there were spi@@ ders still in the ba@@ ths , s@@ lu@@ gs had signed their sign@@ atures on all the win@@ dows , believing the place belonged to them , the garden was over@@ grown with we@@ eds that resem@@ bled giant cab@@ b@@ ages .
it was like a children '@@ s story cot@@ tage , threatening and en@@ chan@@ ting at the same time , the garden full of secrets .
author '@@ s view : Howard Jac@@ ob@@ son , whose novel `` J '@@ ' is long@@ listed for the Man Bo@@ ok@@ er Prize 2014 .
the short@@ list is announced next week
K@@ ever@@ n had been sitting holding hands with A@@ il@@ inn on broken deck@@ chairs in the long gra@@ ss , enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring after@@ no@@ on , the pair of them ab@@ s@@ ent-@@ min@@ dedly plu@@ gged into the utility con@@ sole that supplied the country with so@@ o@@ thing music and cal@@ ming news , when the sight of her crossed bro@@ wn legs reminded him of an old song by a long-@@ forgotten black enter@@ tain@@ er his father had liked listening to with the cot@@ tage blin@@ ds down .
your feet '@@ s too big .
on account of their inn@@ ate aggressi@@ veness , son@@ gs of that sort were no longer played on the con@@ sole .
not banned - nothing was banned exactly - simply not played .
encouraged to fall into des@@ u@@ et@@ ude , like the word des@@ u@@ et@@ ude .
popular taste did what e@@ dict and pro@@ scrip@@ tion could never have done , and just as , when it came to books , the people chose ra@@ gs@@ -to-@@ riches memoirs , co@@ ok@@ books and roman@@ ces , so , when it came to music , they chose bal@@ la@@ ds .
carried away by the day , K@@ ever@@ n began to play at an imaginary pi@@ ano and in a ru@@ d@@ ely com@@ ic voice ser@@ en@@ ade A@@ il@@ inn '@@ s big feet .
A@@ il@@ inn did n@@ '@@ t understand .
`` It was a popular song by a j@@ az@@ z pi@@ an@@ ist called fats W@@ aller , '@@ ' he told her , automatically putting two fingers to his lips .
this his father had always done to stifle the letter J before it left his lips .
it had begun as a game between them when he was small .
his father had played it with his own father , he '@@ d told him .
begin a word with a J without remembering to put two fingers across your mouth and it cost you a pen@@ ny .
it had not been much fun then and it was not much fun now .
he knew it was expected of him , that was all .
he had to explain what j@@ az@@ z was .
A@@ il@@ inn had never heard any .
j@@ az@@ z , too , without exactly being pro@@ scri@@ bed , was n@@ '@@ t played .
im@@ provis@@ ation had fallen out of fashion .
there was room for only one `` if '@@ ' in life .
people wanted to be sure , when a tune began , exactly where it was going to end .
wi@@ t , the same .
its un@@ predictability unsettled people '@@ s ner@@ ves .
and j@@ az@@ z was wi@@ t expressed musi@@ cally .
though he reached the age of 10 without having heard of Sam@@ my Davis junior , K@@ ever@@ n knew of j@@ az@@ z from his father '@@ s semi-@@ secret collection of old CDs .
but at least he did n@@ '@@ t have to tell A@@ il@@ inn that fats W@@ aller was black .
given her age , she was unlikely to have remembered a time when popular sing@@ ers were n@@ '@@ t black .
again , no laws or du@@ re@@ ss .
a compli@@ ant society meant that every section of it con@@ s@@ ented with gra@@ titude - the gra@@ titude of the provi@@ denti@@ ally spared - to the principle of group ap@@ titude .
people of Afro@@ -@@ Caribbean origin were suited by temper@@ ament and physi@@ que to entertainment and athle@@ tics , and so they s@@ ang and sprin@@ ted .
people originally from the Indian sub@@ continent , electron@@ ically gif@@ ted as though by nature , undertook to ensure no family was without a functioning utility phone .
what was left of the Polish community plum@@ bed ; what was left of the Greek sm@@ ashed pl@@ ates .
those from the Gulf States and the Lev@@ ant whose grand@@ parents had n@@ '@@ t quickly left the country while what happened , if IT happened was happening - fearing they '@@ d be accused of having stoked the fl@@ ames , fearing , indeed , that the fl@@ ames would consume them next - opened lab@@ neh and shi@@ sh@@ a-@@ pi@@ pe restaurants , kept their heads down , and grew depressed with i@@ d@@ len@@ ess .
to each according to his gifts .
having heard only bal@@ la@@ ds , A@@ il@@ inn was hard pressed to understand how the insul@@ ting words K@@ ever@@ n had just sung to her could ever have been set to music .
music was the expression of love .
`` They '@@ re not really insul@@ ting , '@@ ' K@@ ever@@ n said .
except maybe to people whose feet are too big .
my father never insul@@ ted anybody , but he deli@@ ghted in this song .
he was saying too much , but the garden '@@ s neglect gave the illusion of safety .
no word could get beyond the sound@@ pro@@ of@@ ing of the giant cab@@ ba@@ ge-@@ like leaves .
A@@ il@@ inn still did n@@ '@@ t comprehend .
why would your father have loved something like that ?
he wanted to say it was a joke , but was reluctant , in her company , to put two fingers to his lips again .
she already thought he was strange .
`` It struck him as fun@@ ny , '@@ ' he said instead .
she sho@@ ok her head in dis@@ belief , blo@@ t@@ ting out K@@ ever@@ n '@@ s vision .
nothing to see in the whole wide world but her ha@@ yst@@ ack of crow@@ -@@ black hair .
nothing else he wanted to see .
`` If you say so , '@@ ' she said , un@@ convinced .
but that still does n@@ '@@ t explain why you '@@ re sin@@ ging it to me .
she seemed in genuine distress .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet specifically , no .
your ank@@ les , maybe , a bit ...
and you say you hate me because my ank@@ les are too th@@ ick ?
hate you ?
of course I do n@@ '@@ t hate you .
that '@@ s just the sil@@ ly song .
he could have said , `` I love you , '@@ ' but it was too soon for that .
`` Y@@ our th@@ ick ank@@ les are the very reason I '@@ m attracted to you , '@@ ' he tried instead .
I '@@ m perverse that way .
it came out wrong .
he had meant it to be fun@@ ny .
meaning to be fun@@ ny often land@@ ed him in a mess because , like his father , he lacked the reassuring charm necessary to temp@@ er the cruelty that lur@@ ked in j@@ okes .
maybe his father intended to be cruel .
maybe he , K@@ ever@@ n , did .
despite his kind eyes .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons fl@@ ush@@ ed and rose from her deck@@ chair , kno@@ cking over the con@@ sole and spil@@ ling the w@@ ine they '@@ d been drinking .
El@@ der@@ f@@ lower w@@ ine , so drink was n@@ '@@ t his excuse .
in her ag@@ itation she seemed to tre@@ m@@ ble , like the fron@@ ds of a pal@@ m tree in a storm .
`` And your th@@ ick head '@@ s the very reason I '@@ m perver@@ sely attracted to you , '@@ ' she said ...
except that I '@@ m not .
he felt sorry for her , both on account of the unnecessary unk@@ ind@@ ness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes in the moment of her standing up to him .
did she think he '@@ d strike her ?
she had n@@ '@@ t spoken to him about life on the chil@@ l northern archi@@ pel@@ ago where she had grown up , but he did n@@ '@@ t doubt it was in all essen@@ ti@@ als similar to here .
the same vast and ic@@ y ocean cra@@ shed in on them both .
the same befu@@ ddled men , even more thin@@ -@@ sk@@ inn@@ ed and pe@@ evi@@ sh in the aftermath of what happened than their smugg@@ ler and wreck@@ er ancestors had been , ro@@ amed an@@ gri@@ ly from pu@@ b to pu@@ b , ready to raise a hand to any woman who dared to refuse or twi@@ t them .
th@@ ick head ?
they '@@ d show her a th@@ ick f@@ ist , if she was n@@ '@@ t careful !
S@@ no@@ g her first - the s@@ no@@ g having become the most common expression of ero@@ tic irrit@@ ation between men and women ; an anti@@ do@@ te to the b@@ land bal@@ la@@ ds of love the con@@ sole pumped out - s@@ no@@ g her first and cu@@ ff her later .
an unnecessary refin@@ ement in K@@ ever@@ n '@@ s view , since a s@@ no@@ g was itself an act of thu@@ g@@ gery .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons made a sign with her body for him to leave .
he he@@ a@@ ved himself out of the deck@@ chair like an old man .
she felt lea@@ den herself , but the weight of his grie@@ f surprised her .
this was n@@ '@@ t the end of the world .
they barely knew each other .
she watched him go - as at an up@@ st@@ airs window her compani@@ on watched him go - a man made heavy by what he '@@ d brought on himself .
Adam leaving the garden , she thought .
she felt a p@@ ang for him and for men in general , no matter that some had raised their hands to her .
a man turned from her , his back bent , ash@@ amed , defeated , all the fight in him leaked away - why was that a sight she felt she knew so well , when she could n@@ '@@ t recall a single instance , before today , of having seen it ?
alone again , A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons looked at her feet .
a score or so years before the events related above , E@@ s@@ me N@@ uss@@ b@@ aum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 3@@ 2-@@ year-old rese@@ ar@@ cher employed by O@@ f@@ now , the non-@@ stat@@ ut@@ ory monitor of the Public Mo@@ od , prepared a short paper on the continu@@ ance of low@@ - and medium-@@ level violence in those very areas of the country where its reduction , if not its c@@ ess@@ ation , was most to have been expected , given the money and energy exp@@ ended on upro@@ oting it .
`` Mu@@ ch has been done , and much continues to be done , '@@ ' she wrote , `` to so@@ o@@ the the native aggressi@@ veness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in those twi@@ sted kn@@ ar@@ ls and narrow cre@@ vices of the country where , though the spi@@ res of churches soar above the hed@@ ger@@ ows , the swe@@ eter breath of human kin@@ dness has , historically , been rarely felt .
but some qualities are proving to be in@@ eradic@@ able .
the higher the sp@@ ire , it would seem , the lower the passions it goes on en@@ gen@@ dering .
the popul@@ ace we@@ eps to sentim@@ ental bal@@ la@@ ds , Gor@@ ges on stories of adversity overcome , and prof@@ esses to believe ard@@ ently in the virtues of marriage and family life , but not only does the old bru@@ ti@@ shness retain a per@@ tin@@ acious hold equally on rural communities as on our urban con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , evidence suggests the emergence of a new and vicious quar@@ rel@@ som@@ eness in the home , in the workplace , on our roads and even on our playing fields .
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to over@@ write , '@@ ' her supervisor said when he had read the whole report .
may I suggest you read fewer no@@ vels .
E@@ s@@ me N@@ uss@@ b@@ aum lowered her head .
I must also en@@ qu@@ ire : are you an athei@@ st ?
`` I believe I am not obliged to say , '@@ ' E@@ s@@ me N@@ uss@@ b@@ aum replied .
are you a les@@ bian ?
again E@@ s@@ me protested her right to privacy and silence .
a feminist ?
silence once more .
`` I do n@@ '@@ t ask , '@@ ' Luther Rab@@ ino@@ witz said at last , `` because I have an objection to athei@@ sm , les@@ bi@@ anism or feminism .
this is a pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ e-@@ free workplace .
we are the servants of a pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ e-@@ free society .
but certain kinds of hyper@@ sensitivity , while entirely acceptable and lau@@ dable in themselves , may sometimes distort findings such as you have presented to me .
you are obviously yourself pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against the church ; and those things you call `` vicious '@@ ' and `` bru@@ tish , '@@ ' others could as soon interpret as expressions of natural vi@@ go@@ ur and vitality .
to still be har@@ ping on about what happened , if IT happened , as though it happened , if it happened , yesterday , is to s@@ ap the country of its essential life force .
E@@ s@@ me N@@ uss@@ b@@ aum looked around her while Rab@@ ino@@ witz spoke .
behind his head a flam@@ ingo p@@ ink L@@ E@@ D sc@@ roll repeated the advice O@@ f@@ now had been disp@@ ens@@ ing to the country for the last quarter of a century or more .
smile at your neighbo@@ ur , cheri@@ sh your spo@@ use , listen to bal@@ la@@ ds , go to musi@@ cals , use your telephone , con@@ verse , explain , listen , agree , apologi@@ se .

`` I fully understand the points you are making , '@@ ' E@@ s@@ me N@@ uss@@ b@@ aum replied in a quiet voice , once she was certain her supervisor had finished speaking , `` and I am saying no more than that we are not he@@ aled as effectively as we del@@ ude ourselves we are .
my concern is that , if we are not fore@@ warned , we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to what happened , if IT happened , in the first place .
only this time it will not be on others that we vent our anger and mistrust .
Luther Rab@@ ino@@ witz made a pyramid of his fingers .
this was to suggest infinite patience .
`` You go too far , '@@ ' he said , `` in describing as `` mistakes '@@ ' actions which our grand@@ parents might or might not have taken .
you go too far , as well , in speaking of them v@@ enting their `` anger '@@ ' and `` mistrust '@@ ' on `` others . '@@ '
it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past , as in protecting the present , we do not speak of `` us '@@ ' and `` them . '@@ '
there was no `` we '@@ ' and there were no `` others . '@@ '
it was a time of disorder , that is all we know of it .
`` In which , if we are honest with ourselves , '@@ ' E@@ s@@ me dared to inter@@ ject , `` no section of society can claim to have acqu@@ itted itself well .
I make no accusations .
whether it was done ill , or done well , what was done was done .
then was then .
no more needs to be said - on this we agree .
and just as there is no blame to be ap@@ por@@ tioned , so there are no am@@ ends to be made , were am@@ ends appropriate and were there any way of making them .

the past exists in order that we forget it .
if I may add one word to that -
Luther Rab@@ ino@@ witz collapsed his pyramid .
`` I will consider your report , '@@ ' he said , dismis@@ sing her .
the next day , turning up for work as usual , she was kno@@ cked down by a mot@@ or@@ cycli@@ st who had mounted the pa@@ vement in what pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by described as a `` vicious rage . '@@ '

Les@@ oth@@ o military says no coup planned ; P@@ M stays in South Africa
Les@@ oth@@ o military officials denied st@@ aging a coup to overthrow the government , saying they were acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics .
Prime Minister Thomas T@@ hab@@ ane fled the country , saying the country '@@ s military had surrounded his official home and seized government buildings in the capital of Mas@@ er@@ u .
the premier took his family to neighboring South Africa after saying he received an assassination threat .
military spokesman Major N@@ tl@@ ele N@@ to@@ i said there was not , in fact , a coup , but that the military was responding to a threat from `` political fanatics '@@ ' whom police were attempting to arm .
`` What happened this morning was that the command of the Les@@ oth@@ o Defense Force was acting after receiving several intelligence reports that am@@ on@@ gst the police service , there are some elements who are actually planning to arm some of the political , party political youth fanatics who were on the verge of wre@@ aking havoc , '@@ ' he told Vo@@ ice of America .
South African government spokesman C@@ lay@@ son Mon@@ y@@ ela said the military '@@ s actions had the appearance at an overthrow .
`` Al@@ though no one has claimed to have taken over government through the use of force , by all accounts the activities of the Les@@ oth@@ o defense force thus far bear the hall@@ marks of a coup d@@ '@@ et@@ at , '@@ ' he said .
Les@@ oth@@ o military officials said soldiers returned to their barra@@ cks Sunday and there was calm in the capital .
meanwhile , Deputy Prime Minister Mo@@ th@@ et@@ jo@@ a Met@@ sing in control of the government in T@@ hab@@ ane '@@ s absence .
T@@ hab@@ ane said he believes he is being targeted due to his attempt to fight corruption in the country .
tensions have been high in Les@@ oth@@ o since June when T@@ hab@@ ane suspended parliament sessions due to feu@@ ding in his unity government .
he said his actions have not undermined the government , despite allegations otherwise .
eurozone manufacturing at 13@@ -@@ month low
manufacturing growth in the eurozone slowed to a 13@@ -@@ month low in August , according to a clo@@ sel@@ y-@@ watched survey .
the final Mark@@ it '@@ s Eurozone Man@@ u@@ fac@@ turing purchasing Manag@@ ers ' Index -LRB- PM@@ I -RRB- di@@ pped to 5@@ 0.7 in August , down from 5@@ 1.8 in July .
a figure above 50 indicates expansion .
new orders dwind@@ led and factories suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
the figures come ahead of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- meeting on Th@@ urs@@ day .
markets will be looking for a clear plan from the bank to deal with a stalled eurozone recovery , as well as the threat of deflation with inflation standing at just 0.3 % .
there is speculation that ECB boss Mario Draghi could offer further indications later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone , similar to those taken by the UK and US during the financial crisis .
`` Al@@ though some growth is better than no growth at all , the bra@@ king effect of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers is becoming more visible , '@@ ' said R@@ ob D@@ ob@@ son , senior economist at Mark@@ it .
the factory PM@@ I for Germany , Russia '@@ s biggest trade partner in the EU , fell to an 1@@ 1-@@ month low of 5@@ 1.4 .
meanwhile , in the bloc '@@ s second-largest economy , France , the PM@@ I fell to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
France remains a real concern , as does Italy '@@ s descent from solid expansion to stagnation .
signs that growth impetus wan@@ ed in the key industrial engine of Germany , and in Spain and the Netherlands too , is also less than reassuring , '@@ ' Mr D@@ ob@@ son said .
the slowdown in industry is likely to add further fuel to the fire for analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented .
one positive note was from the Republic of Ireland , which saw its PM@@ I grow to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , its highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Ar@@ cher , chief economist at I@@ H@@ S Global insight , said : `` The best that can be said for the August eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers ' survey is that it indicates that the sector is still growing . '@@ '
he added : `` Eurozone manufacturers are clearly finding life very difficult at the moment as current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly related to Russi@@ a@@ /@@ Ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries .
this heightened uncertainty has clearly hit business - especially , and consumer confidence , and it is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even canc@@ elled , particularly big-@@ ticket orders .
he said it was looking `` ever more likely '@@ ' that the ECB would ultimately have to undertake some form of QE , `` although we suspect that it will be limited . '@@ '
the Beslan survivors ' decade of hell : ten years since the horrific school siege , how the children caught up in it are still suffering
ten years ago over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan , southern Russia
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day or@@ deal that shocked the world
we went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who che@@ ated death in the classroom atro@@ city
exactly a decade after the appalling Beslan school siege in which 3@@ 34 peri@@ shed , including 18@@ 6 children , the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalyp@@ se in Ukraine .
when fan@@ atic Islamic terrorists kidnapp@@ ed and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004 , at the start of a new term , it seemed like the n@@ adi@@ r of all evil .
the tragedy united east and west in revulsion , which amazingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the di@@ rest misery .
ten years on , we went back to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who che@@ ated death in the classroom atro@@ city .
we discovered amazing young people , who have de@@ fied adversity , though the memory of this terrorist hell will live with them forever .
their greatest hope ?
that the war now scar@@ ring Ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop .
the girl pic@@ tured trying to climb back inside the bli@@ tz@@ ed school g@@ ym
she was famously s@@ napp@@ ed by top Russian photograph@@ er Dmitry Be@@ li@@ ak@@ ov wearing only her under@@ wear as tried to climb back inside the bli@@ tz@@ ed school g@@ ym after a mine exploded .
bewil@@ dered , A@@ i@@ da was desperately searching for her mother , L@@ aris@@ sa , now 40 .
both were feared dead , but in fact they survived .
` A woman told me to run for my life but I could n@@ '@@ t , ' said A@@ i@@ da at the time .
my legs were covered in blood .
I got up and climbed back in to look for my m@@ um .
a soldier plu@@ cked her to safety .
after a series of sur@@ geri@@ es , she thought she had totally recovered but said yesterday : ` Three months ago , the pain came back .
I fear I may need more surgery .
some sh@@ rap@@ nel pieces are still in my kne@@ e .
her aim now is to become a denti@@ st , to help people as she has been aided by medi@@ cs .
` This tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it , ' she said defi@@ antly .
` It happened to me and you ca n@@ '@@ t change this fact .
once a year I always go to the g@@ ym to recall those who remained there .
my friends and I try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too much .
my best friend and my class@@ mat@@ e-@@ to-@@ be D@@ zer@@ a G@@ apo@@ eva was killed there .
we played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together .
` I do n@@ '@@ t want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career .
I will think about a family later .
she says the siege remains with her though memories fade a little each year .
I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere .
when I see online the photo@@ graph of me clim@@ bing into the school window , I think that many people will see it for the first time , understand about our disaster , and stop this from happening any more .
the boy who fled through a hail of bullets believing his mother to be dead
he was on his first day at school -LRB- Russians start school aged 7 -RRB- and survived the three day siege hu@@ gging his m@@ um T@@ am@@ ara .
then seven he said : ` m@@ um@@ my told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand . '
after one explosion he thought she was dying .
she told him : ` Ru@@ n ' .
fearing she was dead , he fled and on his way he saw a c@@ rying to@@ dd@@ ler , grabbed the child by the hand , and fled through a hail of bullets .
his dad Vladimir , who s@@ co@@ op@@ ed up his son outside , said : ` D@@ ami@@ r told me his mother had died .
he said : ` I could n@@ '@@ t save her ' . '
in fact , T@@ am@@ ara had st@@ umb@@ led free and was in hospital with leg wounds , in turn believing her son had peri@@ shed .
after their re@@ union she said : ` I we@@ pt with joy .
I could n@@ '@@ t believe it .
he ran in and hu@@ gged me .
D@@ ami@@ r was later flo@@ wn to London -LRB- by the now def@@ unc@@ t News of the World newspaper -RRB- to be crow@@ ned a Bar@@ nar@@ do '@@ s Chil@@ dren '@@ s Champi@@ on by then premier Tony Blair and wife wife Ch@@ erie .
` This horror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop rec@@ alling it , ' he said yesterday .
still I can say that in my mind it is fading .
I remember right afterwards , I threw away all my to@@ y guns .
but now I can play computer games with shooting and it is not a problem for me .
` I '@@ m not scared to go back in the g@@ ym but I do n@@ '@@ t think about myself .
I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard who never got out .
we never say they were killed or dead .
we say they stayed in the g@@ ym .
I remember my trip to London so well , spec@@ ially the to@@ y shop where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted , and riding in an open top car .
but now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misery he and his friends suffered .
this horror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop rec@@ alling it
` I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors , ' said D@@ ami@@ r , who was last week doing voluntary work at a nun@@ ner@@ y .
I want to help so much .
I want to serve in the police one day and hope they en@@ ro@@ l me to the training ac@@ ademy next year .
his mother T@@ am@@ ara , 48 , said : ` 37 kids were killed in our neigh@@ bour@@ hood , can you imagine ?
I remember terrible silence right after the siege , there were just no children to sh@@ out and run around , and that silence lasted for many months .
she vivi@@ dly recalls her trip with D@@ ami@@ r to London .
people in London were c@@ rying when I told our story .
I realis@@ ed then how fol@@ k on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , can show their support .
she was grateful to ` Ch@@ erie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004 .
I wish I could call Ch@@ erie and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London , and how that helped D@@ ami@@ r and me .
I remember when D@@ ami@@ r wanted to eat bor@@ sch soup , they called all the local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he was playing with wa@@ it@@ ers in a restaurant , D@@ ami@@ r was shooting at them from his water pi@@ sto@@ l and they ran away and played with him .
and we were just one month away from our horror then .
I was am@@ a@@ zed that the British people were so ready to share our pain and to support us .
she said : ` I keep thinking this world did not get better within these 10 years .
now in Ukraine the war goes on , people are dying every day , and I believe many children were killed and will be killed .
they are just the same children , like ours .
I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bor@@ ed or busy with something else .
I just know what those people feel , the horror of it .
and I ca n@@ '@@ t stop feeling it .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and it is so sad .
D@@ ami@@ r grew up and became a very gent@@ le and calm boy , he is not at all aggressive or angry .
he is not seeking revenge for example , he is not preoccupied with this past horror .
I know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six class@@ mates and they go to the g@@ ym from time to time and light cand@@ les there .
when he was smaller he suffered from it - I remember he used to lie down on the sof@@ a with his face turned away from us , for hours at a time .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he threw away all his guns and other arm@@ y-@@ type to@@ ys@@ .@@ D@@ ami@@ r is 17 now , t@@ aller than me , nice looking , clever and healthy .
I can hardly believe that for some hours I was so sure he was dead and I '@@ d never see him again .
when I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around , I saw the hell around me , when body parts were lying everywhere .
I was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survived in this hell .
` I remember I was sh@@ outing to him ` D@@ ami@@ r , run , run away ' but again I was so sure he had not heard me .
but he did hear , and he did run away .
so life goes on for us unlike for so many .
Geor@@ gy Il@@ y@@ in , 17
the boy whose shocking image after the siege came to define the horror of Beslan
comfort : Beslan survi@@ vor Geor@@ gy Il@@ y@@ in with his m@@ um F@@ ati@@ ma after the siege in 2004 , while on the right is Geor@@ gy today
his blood@@ stained face was et@@ ched with fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists gun@@ ned down his class@@ mates .
his picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbar@@ ity at Beslan .
his mother F@@ ati@@ ma , 54 , a senior GP , had dropped him for his first day at school before rushing to take her el@@ der son Vladimir to university .
` I left two minutes before the terrorists rushed into the yard , so my little boy was left there alone for three days of horror , ' she recalled .
not completely alone , we had a family of relatives there but all of them were killed .
only my Geor@@ gy managed to survive .
the closer this date is , the harder it is to think and talk about it .
there is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy .
we do not feel it was long ago , I think it happened yesterday , some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time .
nobody will ever forget , I promise you .
ha@@ unting : the image of Geor@@ gy -LRB- left -RRB- was one of the most shocking of the attack and has been im@@ mort@@ alis@@ ed in a stat@@ ue -LRB- right -RRB-
I remember Geor@@ gy so much wanted to go to school on that day , he said he wanted to hu@@ g his teacher .
I only got to know he was alive when I saw him TV .
and now there is even a stat@@ ue to c@@ rying Geor@@ gy in San Mar@@ ino .
Geor@@ gy does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the book@@ case in our home .
I understand , but I also think that thanks to this picture people from all over the world feel our pain .
Geor@@ gy says now : ` It '@@ s important this can never happen again .
` I doubt we '@@ ll ever know the truth .
people keep investigating such tragedies and never know the truth .
now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is moving to something very bad .
` I ca n@@ '@@ t understand how it happens , because if you ask people , no-@@ one wants a war , so how does it happen ?
ten years is nothing for such pain .
we need dozens of years to pass in order to forget it a little .
it affected my health and I still feel it .
for about three or four years I had some night@@ mar@@ es because of the siege but then it got better .
I got back to school later in 2004 , I was very scared every day .
I was thinking about my friends and class@@ mates who were killed .
this is why I keep going to the g@@ ym as each 1 September approaches .
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends .
it is hard for me to go inside the g@@ ym but I must do it .
I do not feel myself a victim , this story is the part of my past now .
I will not forget it but I do not feel sorry for myself .
my life goes on .
I finished school this year entered a medical university in V@@ ladi@@ k@@ av@@ ka@@ z .
I will learn to be a heart sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was to go in the army .
I wanted to be a military man , but my health did not let me .
I wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen .
Geor@@ gy Far@@ ni@@ yev , 20
the boy who survived despite having been trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
miraculous : Geor@@ gy Far@@ ni@@ yev was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege but still managed to survive
as the siege was underway , he was pic@@ tured trapped inside the g@@ ym , sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is truly a miracle he was not killed .
` We feel as if it was just yesterday , ' said Geor@@ gy , who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the FSB , but was unable to because of damage to his health in the siege .
it is still with me , this is not something I left behind .
I am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - I must say this is not true .
` In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I did feel a bit better afterwards but I ca n@@ '@@ t forget it .
and I would like to forget .
2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the g@@ ym again .
I lost consciousness .
I would never ever go there again and please do n@@ '@@ t ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture .
survi@@ vor : Geor@@ gy Far@@ ni@@ ev pic@@ tured today , with a photo@@ graph of him in hospital f@@ oll@@ wo@@ ing the siege on his lap@@ top
my pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day .
my friends know that I do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school .
in terms of physical condition I am well .
I should be careful with my kne@@ e which was injured but I walk fine now .
still my health did not let me go and study in FSB secret service ac@@ ademy in S@@ t Petersburg as I wanted .
I sent my documents , including medical papers , and they replied it was not possible .
my second passion was animals , so I went to the veter@@ inary institute .
I have completed two years there .
he is learning to treat all animals ` from c@@ ats to co@@ ws ' .
he said : ` I know I would never tell my children about my experience .
this is not something children should know about , and of course not something they should experience .
his mother Mar@@ ina , 42 , said : ` This pain never leaves me .
it is in my soul , worse when the anniversary gets close .
I will go and attend cerem@@ onies being held to mark it .
I know Geor@@ gy wo n@@ '@@ t go .
it must be even stronger for him because he was there and I was not .
I was waiting for him at home , not able to help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me@@ .@@ H@@ ere in Beslan the imp@@ rin@@ t is on everyone .
it stays with us .
Geor@@ gy is an adult now but that horror is still with him .
it is hard to accept it when something so terri@@ bly unfair happens to you .
he is a boy , he likes sports but he ca n@@ '@@ t take part because of his kne@@ e .
he had several sur@@ geri@@ es , he walks but can not exercise .
I would say he 50 % over@@ came this horror , but one can never completely overcome and forget it .
this horrible experience will stay with us .
many friends and neighbo@@ urs were killed in the siege , and it only adds to my pain .
I lost many people I knew well and they were de@@ ar for me .
my son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed .
I know families where new children were born , but also wi@@ dows who never married again .
it is hard to accept that life goes on , even if you do not want it .
I will never forget my heart jump@@ ing out of my ch@@ est at the moment I saw him in hospital .
now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions .
what are those people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it .
we used to be one friendly country in the past , how did it happen that we are fighting now ?
people and children are suffering , I am sure many children were already killed in Ukraine and many will be killed .
if we could only grab all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as possible .

Rus@@ lan is a fantas@@ tic dad and wants to get them away from all the memories as the tenth anniversary is marked .
you can understand why .

4 ti@@ ps for better underwater photos and video
if you '@@ re interested in shooting photos or video underwater , you have a variety of equipment choices .
the cheap@@ est option is a water@@ proof poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ shoot , such as the Nik@@ on Co@@ ol@@ pi@@ x A@@ W@@ 120 or an action C@@ am , such as the Go@@ Pro Hero@@ 3@@ + silver edi@@ tion , which both go for around $ 300 .
I shot these photos at a family party using several cameras , all priced under $ 350 .
no matter what ge@@ ar you use , a few rules apply for getting the best results .
Dou@@ ble-@@ check your ge@@ ar .
even if you have a water@@ proof cam@@ era , make sure that the cam@@ era '@@ s battery and other compar@@ tments are tightly closed .
also , set your cam@@ era to match the type of photos or video you '@@ ll be shooting .
some cameras and cam@@ cor@@ ders have scene or shooting mo@@ des that will optimi@@ ze the exposure for dim under@@ sea sett@@ ings .
and before you jump in , know how deep your equipment can go .
some cameras are rated to only 5 feet , others to 50 or 60 feet .
check out our buying guide and Ratings for digital cameras for both conventional and water@@ proof models .
take multiple shots - because many of them wo n@@ '@@ t work .
Po@@ in@@ t-@@ and-@@ shoot cameras have L@@ CDs to help you com@@ pose photos , while action c@@ ams generally do n@@ '@@ t .
even if you have an L@@ CD , it '@@ s going to hard to see it underwater , and com@@ posing your shot will be a hit@@ -@@ or-@@ miss process .
so shoot multi@@ ples .
also , if your cam@@ era has a bra@@ cket mode , which shoots a burst of shots at slightly different exposure sett@@ ings , take advantage of it .
stay near the surface .
light falls off dramatically the deeper you di@@ ve underwater .
if possible , stay close to the surface when you shoot in a pool , a la@@ ke or the ocean .
this will also allow you to capture more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you '@@ ll see .
get close to your subjects .
this is great advice for shooting on dry land , but it is even more important underwater because of the dim lighting conditions .
it '@@ s particularly important if you '@@ re shooting with an action C@@ am : these devices often have a fixed , wide angle lens , which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the picture frame .
Andrew Law@@ son was the kind of man whose force of personality could shake things up , even in a gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an organisation like the N@@ H@@ S .
a consult@@ ant ana@@ es@@ the@@ tist , he devoted his career to spar@@ ing the sick both the agon@@ ies of illness and the tor@@ ments of treatment .
among those who sought him out , his wife re@@ members , was an MI@@ 6 officer who had to live with the crippling after@@ -@@ effects of torture .
Law@@ son understood that while doctors are cap@@ tiv@@ ated by diagnoses and diseases , those being treated are overwhelmingly concerned with something else entirely : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one who began to suffer .
`` I have not felt myself , '@@ ' he wrote in May that year .
I '@@ ve had difficulty in energi@@ sing myself .
struggling with flu@@ -like symptoms , he found himself impati@@ ently ber@@ ating his wife , Ju@@ lie@@ t .
`` I want everything to happen sooner rather than later , '@@ ' he noted .
when Ju@@ lie@@ t went away on business for a week , Law@@ son found himself unusually , and un@@ accoun@@ tably , upset .
something was up .
he got a colleague to perform a ch@@ est X-@@ ray .
just two weeks earlier he had been sk@@ i@@ ing in the French Al@@ ps .
the results of the X-@@ ray came back .
he had mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , an incur@@ able cancer that affects the ple@@ ura , or lining of the lung .
with most cancers , it is hard to know the exact cause .
though some smokers get lung cancer , for example , not all lung cancer suff@@ er@@ ers have smo@@ ked .
but mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma is different .
in almost every case , the cause is exposure to as@@ best@@ os - a fi@@ bro@@ us building material once dubbed `` miraculous , '@@ ' but now known to be mort@@ ally dangerous .
for most of us , mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma has been an easy disease to ignore .
As@@ best@@ os , after all , is a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of as@@ best@@ os has not been used in Britain since the 1960s , when a voluntary industry ban came into effect .
even when it was used , only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pi@@ pe la@@ ggers , builders , car@@ pen@@ ters and ship@@ yard workers , for example .
an industrial tox@@ in from another era , it hardly seems cause for concern today .
but such complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it turns out , is today at the peak of a mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma epidemic .
there are more mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma deaths here than in any other country on the planet .
with an annual toll of about 2,@@ 500 , more than twice as many people die of the disease as die in accidents in motor vehicles .
Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma annual deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Great Britain
the reason that we are feeling its deadly effects now is that , though as@@ best@@ os use has been illegal for years -LRB- all types of as@@ best@@ os were eventually banned by law in 1999 -RRB- , it usually takes decades for mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma to develop .
and the mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma scourge is not confined to veterans of industrial building jobs .
As@@ best@@ os has been , and in many cases still is , embedded in the homes we live in , the offices we work in , the schools we are educated in , and the stores we shop in .
as a result , mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma is no respec@@ ter of class , wealth , occupation , or age .
the bas@@ tions of privilege , from smart London department stores to public schools , have proved no refuge .
the H@@ ous@@ es of Parliament are ri@@ ddled with as@@ best@@ os .
even the hospitals that are meant to make us better have been reser@@ vo@@ irs of this deadly car@@ c@@ ino@@ gen .
Andrew Law@@ son was not old .
nor was he a pi@@ pe lag@@ ger .
in fact , he struggled to think where he might have come into contact with as@@ best@@ os .
then he put his finger on it .
`` It seems that there may have been a lot of as@@ best@@ os in the tun@@ nels at Gu@@ y '@@ s Ho@@ spit@@ al where I spent six years training , '@@ ' he wrote .
everybody - students , nurses , doctors and por@@ ters - used the tun@@ nels .
one wonders how many of my contempor@@ aries will get the same disease ?
it was a question to which , sadly , he was able to provide a partial answer .
`` Of four doctors who trained at Gu@@ y '@@ s Ho@@ spit@@ al and who subsequently developed mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma in the past five years , '@@ ' he noted in a letter in 2010 , `` I am the only one left alive . '@@ '
how many of us will get this disease ?
Andrew Law@@ son was diagnosed with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma when he was 48 .
when he died , on February 17 this year , he was 55 .
to survive so long is unusual .
fifty per cent of mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers are dead 8 months after diagnosis .
it is always fatal .
so now we can only echo Law@@ son '@@ s question : `` How many of us will get the same disease ? '@@ '
according to Britain '@@ s leading expert on mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , Professor Julian Pe@@ to , our best guess is that between 1970 and 2050 , when the as@@ best@@ os epidemic in Britain should have played itself out , some 9@@ 0,000 people will have died .
most currently have no idea that they will die this way .

a quick glance at the reports from the courts , where those affected often turn for compensation , shows how far the scourge of mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma has spread .
this June , for example , Mark@@ s & Spen@@ cer admitted neg@@ lig@@ ently exposing Jan@@ ice Al@@ len to as@@ best@@ os .
she worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 , supervi@@ sing clothes sec@@ tions at two sites - one of which was the f@@ lag@@ ship store on Oxford Street .
M@@ rs Al@@ len was only 18 when she started working at M & S .
now she has two children in their 20@@ s .
`` Be@@ fore this happened , '@@ ' she says , `` I had never heard of mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , I barely knew about as@@ best@@ os .
I never would have dreamed that I would be affected by it .
few people do know much about as@@ best@@ os .
in fact , as@@ best@@ os describes not one substance but a group of six minerals .
they get their name from the word `` as@@ bes@@ ti@@ form '@@ ' - which describes the fi@@ bro@@ us structure which endo@@ ws them with strength and flexibility .
of the six , three have commonly been used in the building trade .
Chr@@ y@@ so@@ tile , commonly known as White As@@ best@@ os , is by far the most frequently found in buildings today .
it was used in ro@@ of@@ ing panels , floor tiles , pi@@ pe insul@@ ation , bo@@ il@@ er se@@ als , even bra@@ ke lin@@ ings in cars .
it is less lethal than other forms of as@@ best@@ os , but it '@@ s still considered a `` major health hazard '@@ ' that can kill by the EU and WHO .
more dangerous , however , are Brown As@@ best@@ os -LRB- am@@ o@@ site -RRB- and Blue As@@ best@@ os -LRB- cro@@ ci@@ do@@ lite -RRB- .
Britain was once the world '@@ s largest impor@@ ter of Brown As@@ best@@ os , and experts suggest that `` there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major cause of the uniquely high mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma rate -LSB- in the UK -RSB- . '@@ '
a Mark@@ s & Spen@@ cer employee was exposed to as@@ best@@ os at its f@@ lag@@ ship store in Oxford Street , London Al@@ am@@ y
Jan@@ ice Al@@ len may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , but Julian Pe@@ to '@@ s work suggests that her story is far from un@@ common .
he has produced a study of suff@@ er@@ ers which suggests that `` a substantial proportion of mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om@@ as with no known occup@@ ational or domestic exposure were probably caused by environmental as@@ best@@ os exposure . '@@ '
much of that exposure , he says , is due to `` normal occupation and wea@@ thering '@@ ' of our buildings .
no one , it seems , can be sure that they are safe .
a report from Go@@ d@@ dar@@ d Consul@@ ting , which looked at the Pal@@ ace of West@@ min@@ ster , shows how people , even in the heart of government , might have been exposed un@@ awar@@ es .
in 2009 Go@@ d@@ dar@@ d reported that service shaf@@ ts and pi@@ ping duc@@ ts behind Parli@@ ament@@ ary committee rooms were contaminated with as@@ best@@ os , whose lethal fi@@ b@@ res could be distur@@ bed by something as inno@@ cu@@ ous as `` strong currents of air . '@@ '
MPs are frequently accused of looking after their own interests , but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true .
while the Parli@@ ament@@ ary Wor@@ ks Services Direc@@ torate insisted that the Pal@@ ace of West@@ min@@ ster had been given `` a clean bill of health , '@@ ' it is now accepted £ 1@@ bn of work lasting several years is required to overhaul Parliament , upgrading electri@@ cs and removing as@@ best@@ os , and that after the 2015 general election MPs may sit in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than on the Green ben@@ ches at West@@ min@@ ster .
the Go@@ d@@ dar@@ d report noted that `` the presence of as@@ best@@ os has not been managed in accordance with the various regulations . '@@ '
it is impossible to know if this mismanagement will cost lives .
all anyone can do now is wait .
one person who has never been able to pin@@ point his exposure to as@@ best@@ os is Graham Abb@@ ot@@ t , a GP .
like Andrew Law@@ son , Abb@@ ot@@ t , 50 , suspects that he was exposed to as@@ best@@ os while working in hospitals .
`` I have worked at a hospital where positive as@@ best@@ os claims have been made , '@@ ' he says , `` But I ca n@@ '@@ t prove it in my case .
it '@@ s so hard to remember all the places one has worked in , and the dates .
what he re@@ members clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fever .
he was 45 , and in the middle of a late evening surgery .
suddenly I started feeling shi@@ very .
it came on very quickly .
I felt dreadful .
I did n@@ '@@ t think I was going to be able to drive all the way home .
being a doctor , Abb@@ ot@@ t knew that the pain was coming from the ple@@ ura , the lining around his lung@@ s .
but like Jan@@ ice Al@@ len , he simply had no reason to suspect mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma .
he ended up spending a month off work .
puzz@@ led doctors gave him ch@@ est X-@@ ra@@ ys , and administered ple@@ ural ca@@ the@@ ters to draw off fluid from the lung@@ s and send it for assessment .
yet the condition went un@@ diagnosed .
slowly his health improved and he went back to work .
but from time to time the same symptoms returned , often after he took exercise and was breathing hard .
in 2011 , one of Abb@@ ot@@ t '@@ s patients arrived at his GP '@@ s surgery with similar symptoms to him , and was subsequently diagnosed with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma .
but even then Abb@@ ot@@ t did n@@ '@@ t make the connection with his own case .
after all , his patient was decades older , and had worked directly as@@ best@@ os .
the link in that case was clear .
in September 2011 , Abb@@ ot@@ t '@@ s condition worsened again , and his consult@@ ant took his C@@ T sc@@ ans and X-@@ ra@@ ys to a panel of experts .
in December 2011 , exactly two years after Abb@@ ot@@ t started feeling un@@ well , a probe , equipped with a cam@@ era , was fed into the c@@ av@@ ity between the lining of his ch@@ est and the lining of his lung .
I '@@ m an optimi@@ st .
I tend just to plo@@ d along , '@@ ' he says .
I had n@@ '@@ t worried about it too much to be honest .
but Rach@@ el , my wife , was worrying .
the result of the bi@@ op@@ sy came in the week between Christmas and New Year : `` I was told it was mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma . '@@ '
Graham Abb@@ ot@@ t : diagnosed with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma
suddenly Abb@@ ot@@ t was plunged into meetings with Mac@@ mill@@ an nurses , one of whom suggested that he should get in touch with a lawyer .
that was when he realis@@ ed the scale of the epidemic .
`` It turns out that as@@ best@@ os was widely used , particularly in big public buildings which quite often had as@@ best@@ os lagging on the pi@@ pes , '@@ ' he says .
people who were exposed to as@@ best@@ os in those buildings are now coming down with the disease .
so mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma is now affecting younger people not in the typical prof@@ essions .
the most dangerous as@@ besto@@ s-@@ lagged pi@@ pes in hospitals were below ground level , so patients are unlikely to have been affected .
but many staff , walking in pedestri@@ an tun@@ nels to get from one building to another -LRB- like Andrew Law@@ son -RRB- , or eating in bas@@ ement c@@ ante@@ ens -LRB- as Graham Abb@@ ot@@ t frequently did -RRB- almost certainly did come into contact with the toxic substance .
for several decades after the war , it turns out , hospitals were potentially life-saving places for patients , but life-@@ threatening places for the doctors who treated them .
it is still being removed today .
pup@@ ils per@@ ched their Bun@@ sen bur@@ ners on as@@ best@@ os mat@@ s
and it is not just hospitals .
As@@ best@@ os was frequently used in offices , shops , libr@@ aries and town h@@ alls for its mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous insul@@ ating and flam@@ e-@@ ret@@ arding properties .
schools too .
in fact many people will have been first exposed to as@@ best@@ os in the classroom .
up and down the country , in myriad chemistry lessons , pup@@ ils have per@@ ched their Bun@@ sen bur@@ ners on as@@ best@@ os mat@@ s .
web@@ sites have sprung up to address the issue of as@@ best@@ os in schools .
meanwhile , in our homes , items as inno@@ cu@@ ous as floor tiles or shed ro@@ of@@ s have routinely contained as@@ best@@ os .
`` It '@@ s an industrial poison built into large amounts of our housing stock , '@@ ' notes Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew Law@@ son in his case against Gu@@ y '@@ s Ho@@ spit@@ al .
in one case the only contact the woman suff@@ erer could think of was pulling down a garden shed in the 1970s .
so be careful how you pull down the garden shed .
the impact of diagnosis , knowing that the disease is incur@@ able , is huge .
`` It takes a while to sink in , '@@ ' says Graham Abb@@ ot@@ t .
I went back to work and tried to carry on but realis@@ ed that I could n@@ '@@ t concentrate on what I was doing .
I was at the surgery for two weeks .
then I realis@@ ed that I would have to leave and sort myself out .
well , I wo n@@ '@@ t see Christmas again
one of the hardest things was moving from the position of doctor to that of patient .
like countless patients before him , he re@@ members feeling bewil@@ dered by the amount of information to get to gri@@ ps with .
`` It was hard to take everything in , '@@ ' he says .
`` I asked my consult@@ ant `` How long do I have ? '@@ '
I was quoted about 12 months .
I remember thinking `` Well , I wo n@@ '@@ t see Christmas again .
that '@@ s it . '@@ ' '@@ '
Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma is particularly pernicious , because it is the mechan@@ ics of how we stay alive - the very act of breathing - that causes the cancer that kills .
most Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma cases are caused by exposure to as@@ best@@ os .
As@@ best@@ os is made up of tiny fi@@ b@@ res .
when the as@@ best@@ os is distur@@ bed and the fi@@ b@@ res are in@@ hal@@ ed , they can become embedded in the ple@@ ura , the lining of the lung@@ s .
As@@ best@@ os fi@@ b@@ res irrit@@ ate the ple@@ ura and can cause cell mutations .
`` The problem comes from in@@ hal@@ ed need@@ le-@@ shaped fi@@ b@@ res of as@@ best@@ os , '@@ ' Professor Tom treas@@ ure , a car@@ di@@ o-@@ thor@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ ge@@ on who moved in 2001 to Gu@@ y '@@ s Ho@@ spit@@ al .
the very hospital where Andrew Law@@ son suspected he was exposed to as@@ best@@ os is now , ironically , a leading centr@@ e in treating mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma .
treas@@ ure knew Law@@ son , and treated some others who are likely to have been exposed while training at the hospital .
once the as@@ best@@ os need@@ les get into the lung tissue , says treas@@ ure , `` the act of breathing pushes them on the periphery , which is where the lining is .
it is by its nature invasive from the very beginning .
the normal options for treating other forms of cancer work less well with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma .
the effectiveness of surgery , for example , is hot@@ ly debated .
some feel it is worth trying .
treas@@ ure dis@@ agrees .
`` You ca n@@ '@@ t ex@@ ci@@ se the ple@@ ura , '@@ ' he says .
you ca n@@ '@@ t get your kni@@ fe round it .
meanwhile the cancer `` is not very responsive to chemotherapy , '@@ ' which `` has an effect '@@ ' but does not cure .
`` E@@ very now and again you get long survivors , '@@ ' says treas@@ ure .
but in the end they all die .
happily , some patients do live far , far beyond expectations .
the author Stephen J@@ ay G@@ ould died 20 years after diagnosis .
two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Abb@@ ot@@ t is still battling on .
after cont@@ acting mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma Abb@@ ot@@ t was put in touch with Andrew Law@@ son , who , four years after his diagnosis , had become a one-@@ man support and advice bure@@ au for fellow suff@@ er@@ ers .
`` H@@ ell@@ o , Canc@@ er Central , '@@ ' he would announce che@@ eri@@ ly when they called .
`` He was very positive , '@@ ' says Abb@@ ot@@ t .
he had been diagnosed 4 years before and was still very active .
initially , Abb@@ ot@@ t had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months , and likely prolong his life by just one month .
`` I felt desperate , '@@ ' he says .
I felt like giving up .
Law@@ son , however , `` managed to put a slightly better tin@@ t on things . '@@ '
after seeing several consult@@ ants , Abb@@ ot@@ t decided to pursue his treatment with Pro@@ f Lo@@ ic Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ dun@@ ski , professor in thor@@ ac@@ ic surgery at Gu@@ y '@@ s .
`` We had an advantage in that I did n@@ '@@ t have to be referred , I just rang them up and they saw me , '@@ ' Graham admits .
the average patient would have to get a refer@@ ral and have funding approved .
money is crucial for those with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma to pursue the best available treatments .
but when those treatments eventually , inevitably , fail , many suff@@ er@@ ers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind .
and so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation .
Andrew Law@@ son cont@@ acted Andrew Morgan , from F@@ iel@@ d Fisher Water@@ house L@@ L@@ P .
`` It has been known that as@@ best@@ os is no@@ xi@@ ous to health since 18@@ 98 , '@@ ' says Morgan .
but what changed in the 1960s is that it was realis@@ ed that even very low levels could be a risk to health .
that is where company neg@@ ligence came in .
Andrew Law@@ son and Gu@@ y '@@ s hospital eventually settled their case , but it was not what Morgan calls a `` full-@@ value settlement '@@ ' since Law@@ son could not prove definitively that his mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was down to as@@ best@@ os exposure at Gu@@ y '@@ s .
after the in@@ quest into his death , a spokesman for Gu@@ y '@@ s did confirm , however , that `` the as@@ best@@ os in the bas@@ ement area concerned was removed in the 1990s . '@@ '
that was too late for Andrew Law@@ son .
how to remove as@@ best@@ os
in fact , p@@ inning lethal as@@ best@@ os exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved a huge problem for mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers seeking compensation .
many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business .
insurance records may have been lost .
and those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side , which the cla@@ im@@ ants certainly do not .
in response , this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be traced .
the law has created a £ 3@@ 50@@ m pot of money , funded by the insurance industry , for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue .
in these cases suff@@ er@@ ers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court might have awarded in a normal compensation case - about £ 1@@ 20,000 .
about 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year .
Andrew Morgan , like many involved with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers , thinks that £ 3@@ 50@@ m represents `` a very good job '@@ ' for the insurance industry .
`` It '@@ s a deal written by insurers for insurers '@@ ' he says , suggesting that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the passage of time had not intervened , and mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers were able to track down companies and sue them in the normal way .
even Mike Pen@@ ning , then Wor@@ ks and Pen@@ sions minister , admitted that the law was `` not perfect . '@@ '
but both Pen@@ ning and Morgan admit that , with seven victims dying each day , quick action was needed .
`` People are suffering so much , and need help today , '@@ ' said Pen@@ ning during the Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma Bill '@@ s second reading in December last year .
by then , Graham Abb@@ ot@@ t had been in the hands of Pro@@ f Lo@@ ic Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ dun@@ ski for 19 months .
after their initial consultations , Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ dun@@ ski advised surgery which , in contrast to Tom treas@@ ure , he believes has a positive effect .
this was followed by radi@@ other@@ ap@@ y and chemotherapy - a tri@@ -@@ therapy for which Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ dun@@ ski can bo@@ ast five year survival rates as high as 40 per cent .
Abb@@ ot@@ t felt empowered .
`` That of course is one of the most important things , '@@ ' says Abb@@ ot@@ t .
you see it in patients all the time .
there is some drive that keeps you going .
when you give up you can deteriorate very quickly .
Graham Abb@@ ot@@ t went in for surgery in March 2012 .
by the end of August he had completed the last of his six cycles of chemotherapy .
follow-up sc@@ ans revealed no sign of the disease .
then I had my s@@ can in March -LSB- 2014 -RSB- .
there was multiple spot@@ ting -LSB- of cancer -RSB- around my ch@@ est .
I was just about to turn 50 .
it '@@ s not life threatening .
it '@@ s life ending .
once again Abb@@ ot@@ t put himself through six cycles of chemotherapy .
now there is no sign of the tu@@ mo@@ urs .
but the process is both physically and emotionally gru@@ elling .
you have to think about practical things - about the finances when I '@@ m gone for example , or showing my wife how the bo@@ il@@ er tim@@ er works .
when you get bad news you start getting negative .
you have to look forward .
as the father of E@@ lli@@ e , 16 , and T@@ am@@ sin , 14 , that is not always easy .
`` It '@@ s hard as a parent , '@@ ' he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much to say .
when I was first diagnosed I told the girls that I had a condition that meant I was n@@ '@@ t going to become old .
they reacted very differently .
T@@ am@@ sin is very soci@@ able and bo@@ ist@@ erous .
she told her friends and we got lots of calls very quickly .
E@@ lli@@ e was more reserved .
she did n@@ '@@ t say much .
such convers@@ ations are something that all cancer patients must face .
but for mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers such discussions are not lea@@ ven@@ ed by hope , by even a g@@ lim@@ mer of a possibility of survival .
the disease carries with it -LRB- even as it did , eventually , for Stephen J@@ ay G@@ ould -RRB- a grim certainty .

China refuses to give Hong Kong right to choose leaders ; protesters vo@@ w vengeance
China '@@ s parliament decided Sunday against letting Hong Kong voters nomin@@ ate candidates for the 201@@ 7 election , despite growing ag@@ itation for democratic reform .
the move is likely to spark long-@@ promised protests in Hong Kong '@@ s business district , as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement .
the decision by China '@@ s National People '@@ s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to we@@ ed out any candidates not loyal to Beijing .
`` It '@@ s not unexpected , but it is still inf@@ uri@@ ating , '@@ ' said legislat@@ or Emi@@ ly L@@ au , chair@@ woman of the Democratic Party .
this is not what Beijing promised .
they '@@ ve lied to the people of Hong Kong .
and it '@@ s clear we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
defending China '@@ s ruling , Li F@@ ei , deputy secretary general of the Stand@@ ing Committee of the National People '@@ s Congress , said allowing public nomin@@ ations in the election for Hong Kong '@@ s leader would be too `` chaotic . '@@ '
since 1997 , when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China , Beijing had promised to allow the region '@@ s residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 201@@ 7 .
Chinese leaders presented the Sunday ruling as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kon@@ gers a direct vote , but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nomin@@ ating committee tightly controlled by Beijing .
and , according to a new clause , only candidates who `` love the country , and love Hong Kong '@@ ' would be allowed .
the ruling comes after a summer that has feat@@ ured some of the largest and most high-profile protests in Hong Kong in years .
behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Lo@@ ve and Peace movement , whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not grant authenti@@ c universal suffrage .
on Sunday night , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had assembled in the rain outside the Hong Kong government '@@ s headquarters .
at the demonstration , organizers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil di@@ so@@ be@@ dience and that they would mount waves of protests in the coming weeks .
however , they did not give details , apparently looking to avoid problems with authorities .
in an online statement , organizers said the movement `` has considered occupying Central only as the last resort , an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice .
we are very sorry to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen .
authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing '@@ s announcement for days , and security was tight Sunday at the government headquarters , with police and barri@@ c@@ ades deployed .
driving the unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city .
an influx of main@@ l@@ anders is fueling competition for products and services .
there is also growing fear that Hong Kong '@@ s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , are beginning to bend under increasing pressure from Beijing .
some have criticized the Occupy Central movement , saying its demonstrations put business - the life@@ blood of Hong Kong - at risk .
`` The protest they are talking about , it could result in much economic damage , depending on how many are involved and for how long , '@@ ' said legislat@@ or Re@@ gin@@ a I@@ p , who has long criticized the movement .
we do n@@ '@@ t want concern to spread that Hong Kong is getting out of control .
this is a perception that is bad for investment .
China '@@ s state-run media also has run stories in recent days pain@@ ting Hong Kong '@@ s democracy activists as agents of sub@@ version directed by Western powers .
this summer , activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights that drew 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters .
and in July , tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region '@@ s history .
US prom culture hits university life with fre@@ shers offered private jet entran@@ ces
we '@@ re exc@@ ited to be answer@@ ing this demand by launching the UK '@@ s first lux@@ urious travel service for the students of today .
to make the maximum impact arriving at university , the company also offers transport options including private jet , Roll@@ s@@ -R@@ oy@@ ce ph@@ an@@ tom , A@@ ston Martin or Mc@@ L@@ aren P@@ 1 .
Mr Ste@@ wart also claimed the service had a safety aspect .
the service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to hau@@ l their bel@@ ong@@ ings across the country in a dangerously over@@ loaded car .
p@@ aired with our new V@@ I@@ F options , we '@@ re looking forward to ensuring this year students reach university with minimum f@@ uss and maximum luxury .
a spokesman for the company said that because the service has just launched there have been no book@@ ings yet but added that `` students will be book@@ ing the service over the next few weeks . '@@ '
the company also said that despite students facing tuition fees of £ 9,000 a year , it still expected to find a market for the service .
students of today are quite different in terms of expectations and aspirations , compared to students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it '@@ s more important than ever to make a great first impression and V@@ I@@ F is just the way to do that .
however , the National Union of Stu@@ dents critici@@ sed the service as out of touch .
Me@@ gan D@@ un@@ n , N@@ US vice president for higher education , said : `` This scheme seems incredibly out of touch with the lives of the majority of students .
many students starting university this month are facing a cost of living crisis , with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spir@@ alling bills for basic essen@@ ti@@ als , before they can even start thinking about for@@ king out thousands of po@@ unds for something as simple arriving at their h@@ alls of residence .

after two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo@@ . over the shooting of un@@ armed teen@@ ager Michael Brown , blo@@ gger Mi@@ ri@@ am Z@@ oil@@ a Per@@ ez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists .
in her experience , white feminist commen@@ ters prioriti@@ zed gender above race when it came to pushing forward reproductive rights and income inequality .
but as tensions rose in the Mi@@ d@@ west and drew nationwide coverage , Per@@ ez saw responses from white women that centered 100 percent around race .
compared to the responses of black women soon after the shooting on August 9 , the personal ess@@ ays with tit@@ les like `` thoughts on Ferguson as a white woman '@@ ' and `` Femin@@ ism Is Not Just Ab@@ out Women '@@ s oppression '@@ ' came relatively late .
but to Per@@ ez , it demonstrated a significant shift .
`` In feminism , I do n@@ '@@ t think you get a lot of people talking about whit@@ eness and privilege in such a high level way , '@@ ' she said .
people felt called to voice something about what happened .
it '@@ s very emblematic of the crisis we face and because -LSB- the situation in Ferguson -RSB- is so ra@@ ci@@ alized , they have to call that out .
for O@@ hi@@ o State University English professor K@@ orith@@ a Mitchell , Ferguson brought to light issues that black American women face every day but that are n@@ '@@ t seen as `` women '@@ s issues '@@ ' in the cultural sphere .
`` I can post something fun@@ ny on Facebook about what '@@ s going on with me and my partner and it will get 150 likes from all over the place , '@@ ' said Mitchell .
when I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country , the silence is de@@ af@@ ening .
`` How is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere ? '@@ ' she asked .
for black women like Mitchell who have studied race , gender and sexuality in U.S. history , there is no di@@ ch@@ ot@@ omy between issues regarding race and gender .
to her , black women have not had the luxury of ne@@ at@@ ly separating the issues ; they live the combined reality every day .
while white women are now combining issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist spheres , Angela Hat@@ tery , women and gender studies professor at George Mas@@ on University , says their predecessors did the opposite .
`` Bet@@ ween 18@@ 65 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were l@@ yn@@ ched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , '@@ ' said Hat@@ tery .
you needed the white woman to be complicit in the narrative to justify the l@@ yn@@ ching .
to Hat@@ tery , the breakdown between white and black women came when white suff@@ ra@@ gi@@ sts like Susan B. An@@ th@@ ony surve@@ yed the landscape in the late 18@@ 0@@ 0s and saw that the fight for voting rights would only work for one group at a time : women or blacks .
`` They made the decision to put their eggs in the basket for votes for women and votes for Black@@ s would come later , '@@ ' said Hat@@ tery .
to look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color do n@@ '@@ t trust white women .
we have n@@ '@@ t done a good job .
we have n@@ '@@ t helped black women protect their husbands and sons ever .
even after women won the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women to organize against l@@ yn@@ ching as the Association of Southern W@@ om@@ an for the Pre@@ vention of l@@ yn@@ ching .
the group came nearly 40 years after black women originally asked for assistance , said Mitchell .
to Mitchell , the up@@ s@@ well of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police conduct , racial discrimination - reflect the times white feminists have had to play `` catch up '@@ ' to issues black women have grap@@ pled with for generations .
`` W@@ ould n@@ '@@ t it be great if the activists who have those -LSB- traditional feminist -RSB- platforms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control ? '@@ ' posed Mitchell .
second wave feminists who made careers out of fighting for reproductive rights and access to birth control are now fig@@ uring out what that means .
noted white feminist activist Gl@@ oria St@@ einem took to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown '@@ s shooting to post a pointed col@@ umn by Gu@@ ardi@@ an colum@@ nist Re@@ be@@ cc@@ a Car@@ roll that demanded more protest from white Americans on the issue of racism .
`` I hope women , who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger that is located in the body - and racial opinions that are meas@@ ur@@ ably different in public polls - will lead the change , '@@ ' St@@ einem wrote .
although St@@ einem has vou@@ ched for a more inter@@ sec@@ tional feminism that includes issues of race as well as gender , her comments on race in America still puzzle some .
American En@@ ter@@ pri@@ se Institute scholar Chri@@ stina Sommers , author of `` Who st@@ ole Femin@@ ism ? , '@@ ' told S@@ he The People that young men in the United States , especially young men of color , are `` far more vulnerable than their si@@ sters , '@@ ' but St@@ einem '@@ s remarks on Ferguson counter the criticism she has launched in the past .
we now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the White House recently initiated a small program , My Bro@@ ther '@@ s ke@@ ep@@ er , to help vulnerable black and Hispan@@ ic young men , there was an angry reaction from many feminists , including Gl@@ oria St@@ einem .
police relations with the black community is not the only issue pushing to the forefront of mainstream feminism .
after U.S. border patro@@ l ap@@ preh@@ ended nearly 6@@ 3,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors at the country '@@ s sou@@ thwest border this year , immigration reform sur@@ faced once again - this time as a women '@@ s issue .
Andre@@ a Mer@@ cad@@ o , co-@@ chair of We belong To@@ gether , an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform , said that in order to re@@ brand the issue as essential for women , all she needed to do was share immigrant women '@@ s stories .
`` They speak for themselves , '@@ ' Mer@@ cad@@ o said .
when the vast majority of employment visas are given to -LSB- male immigrants -RSB- , the women who come with them are left in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories reson@@ ate with women '@@ s organizations , '@@ ' she said .
I@@ p@@ swi@@ ch ` pi@@ g in residence ' house for sale
a picture for a house for sale in Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k was removed by estate agents when it emerged it showed a large pi@@ g at rest in the living room .
on sale for £ 1@@ 20,000 , the det@@ ached one-@@ bed@@ room property sits on a private road in I@@ p@@ swi@@ ch .
the particul@@ ars feat@@ ured a picture of the living room of the house - which included a pi@@ g with its head re@@ sting on a set@@ tee .
estate agents Conn@@ ells said the pi@@ g in the photo was the home owner '@@ s pet .
`` Ho@@ w@@ ever , the photo was put up in error and has since been removed , '@@ ' a spokes@@ woman for the company said .
in the particul@@ ars for the property , Conn@@ ells described the former meeting house as a `` unique one bed@@ room det@@ ached house . '@@ '
although the agency has removed the image from its web@@ site , it still appears in publicity material .
the house sale has sparked interest on social media , where some have en@@ qui@@ red whether the pi@@ g is included in the sale .
S@@ W town of Harv@@ ey has fresh million@@ aire after Lot@@ to win
a Harv@@ ey lot@@ to player is in the month .
the search is on for a new million@@ aire in Per@@ th '@@ s sou@@ th-@@ west , with one lucky person taking home nearly $ 1.1 million from Satur@@ day night '@@ s lot@@ to draw .
a Harv@@ ey new@@ sa@@ gency struck gold in the division one draw for the second time in five years , the last being $ 1 million in November 2009 .
however the lucky winner has yet to come forward .
owner of the store Steve Forward said the win was creating a bu@@ z@@ z around the small town in Per@@ th '@@ s south west .
it '@@ s the talk of the town and everyone is pretty exc@@ ited .
we thought a win like this might be close .
eight wa winners have celebrated division one wins last month , cap@@ ping off a lucky few weeks for the state '@@ s players .
last week a C@@ ann@@ ing V@@ ale player became one of five August million@@ aire '@@ s , following a Bel@@ mon@@ t couple '@@ s massive $ 7.5 million win only a few weeks prior .
the winning couple had played the game for twenty years and said the win gif@@ ted them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new house .
the Harv@@ ey million@@ aire brings wa up to 59 division one winners for the year , tot@@ alling in nearly $ 85 million .
Leoni@@ das beg@@ ged in the g@@ ladi@@ atorial arena
it was not only the g@@ ladi@@ ators that stood ank@@ le deep in the mud at the park during R@@ hein@@ b@@ ach '@@ s first Roman day .
the appeal of the event was so great that it attracted more than 1000 visitors yesterday , who bra@@ ved the rain and autumn chil@@ l , and who were completely taken in by the historical show .
there was a color@@ ful start with represent@@ ations , per@@ forman@@ ces , games , exhibition pieces and information on Roman times and their significance to the R@@ hin@@ eland .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ tial arts group from the g@@ ladi@@ ator school `` Am@@ or Mor@@ tis , '@@ ' which , every time it stopped ra@@ ining , seized the opportunity to demonstrate their robust mar@@ tial arts in the soft sand covered arena .
the owner of g@@ ladi@@ ators `` Leoni@@ das '@@ ' proved himself to be a hum@@ or@@ ous and expert pres@@ enter , who sent men , one after one , into the ring for a heroic du@@ el in a variety of g@@ ladi@@ atorial gen@@ res .
at first the `` provoc@@ ateur@@ s '@@ ' were lined up with a rec@@ t@@ ang@@ ular shield and short sword , as well a cu@@ is@@ se on the left leg , and a v@@ embrace on the right arm .
then there were the `` Ess@@ ed@@ ari@@ i '@@ ' wearing a bre@@ ast@@ -@@ plate , and carrying a short sword and a spe@@ ar , as well as an iron g@@ ladi@@ ator hel@@ met , a cu@@ is@@ se and an arm guard .
what was particular impressive was the performance of the `` Re@@ ti@@ ari@@ us , '@@ ' who went up against the `` Sec@@ utor '@@ ' with a cast@@ -@@ net , Tri@@ dent and d@@ ag@@ ger , and who , after a short fight , kno@@ cked the guys to the ground .
the s@@ words clas@@ hed against one another , the shiel@@ ds cl@@ ank@@ ed and the spe@@ ars fle@@ w , zo@@ oming through the arena , so much so that you feared for the safety of the g@@ ladi@@ ators .
however , the gigantic `` Sum@@ ma Ru@@ dis , '@@ ' a mus@@ cular refer@@ ee , constantly kept a keen eye on them .
`` We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life , and enable the culture of Roman times to be experienced , '@@ ' L@@ or@@ enz E@@ us@@ kir@@ chen , the chairman of the events organization `` Fre@@ undes@@ kreis Rö@@ mer@@ kanal '@@ ' explained as the intention behind the spectacle .
Cl@@ aus W@@ eh@@ age , the deputy mayor , announced in his welcome speech that after two years of preparation , the park was transformed for one day into an `` O@@ pp@@ i@@ d@@ um Rom@@ an@@ um , '@@ ' a Roman city .
in the end , the Rom@@ ans not only brought war and conquest to our region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings , which we can still admire today .
some of these remains could also be mar@@ veled at during the Roman day , such as `` Adu@@ ä@@ duk@@ t-@@ Mar@@ m@@ or '@@ ' from the elev@@ en-@@ meter high , and 14@@ 00 meter long , Roman can@@ al bridge , which is the only one in L@@ ü@@ f@@ tel@@ berg .
the Fron@@ tin@@ us organization compared , both then and now , the water and energy supply , and the managing director , Pet@@ ra Fri@@ cke , said : `` We still derive benefit today from the knowledge of back then . '@@ '
this was confirmed by the surve@@ y@@ or R@@ al@@ ph Hei@@ liger from `` Ingenie@@ ur@@ te@@ am@@ Zwei '@@ ' in R@@ hein@@ back , who introduced the instruments used by the Rom@@ ans for surve@@ ying , such as the Ch@@ or@@ ob@@ at , Gro@@ ma and Di@@ op@@ tra .
the Rö@@ mer@@ vi@@ lla in Bl@@ ank@@ en@@ hei@@ m presented sk@@ et@@ ches and models of the exc@@ av@@ ations of 18@@ 94 , as well as bri@@ cks made from the original hypo@@ cau@@ st , forc@@ ed-@@ air heating , which was once used to warm up Rö@@ mer@@ vi@@ lla .
the foot@@ prin@@ ts of a w@@ olf and fo@@ x from two thousand years ago were also impressive , and were left behind after they tro@@ d in cla@@ y before it was bur@@ nt .
in 2011 the office of archa@@ e@@ ological mon@@ ument conservation at the state association in R@@ hein@@ land exc@@ av@@ ated the remains of a Roman V@@ illa in an industrial estate in north R@@ hein@@ b@@ ach .
the en@@ closing walls of an agricultural building were discovered and contained a kil@@ n for dr@@ ying crops and mal@@ ting .
the building probably belonged to a V@@ illa Rus@@ ti@@ ca , an agricultural man@@ or , archa@@ e@@ ologist Dr. J@@ enni@@ fer Mor@@ schei@@ ser explained .
a range of finds from the exc@@ av@@ ation were presented in a glass cabinet , among which were a large plate , several fine glass j@@ ars and parts of a small nec@@ kl@@ ace .
Mor@@ schei@@ ser presumed that the V@@ illa was there from between the first and fourth century An@@ no Domini until the invasion of the Ger@@ man@@ ic people in the former Roman R@@ hein@@ land .
the children also kept themselves busy playing the Roman wind@@ mills game , similar to today '@@ s mi@@ ll game , or they wrote , as did the Roman pup@@ ils at the time , their names with metal p@@ ens on wa@@ x tab@@ lets .
at the Roman ther@@ mal b@@ ath stand from Zü@@ l@@ pi@@ ch , the children were allowed to lay mo@@ sa@@ ics themselves ; at the R@@ hein@@ b@@ ach glass museum stand they made glass mo@@ sa@@ ics ; and at the Ei@@ fel Net@@ ter@@ sh@@ eim nature center stand , they got to use a heavy wheat mi@@ ll made of stone so they could gr@@ ind the flo@@ ur needed for a pit@@ a bread or mu@@ es@@ li .
the visitors ro@@ de through the park in a Roman carri@@ age , which had been reconstruc@@ ted to be true to the original , and pulled along by two cold blood hor@@ ses , and also passed by the impressive city g@@ ym stand , where the results of their `` Roman project week '@@ ' were revealed .
from 13 to 21 September , the community of W@@ acht@@ berg will also participate in a Roman week , in what is being called Roman Year 2014 throughout the R@@ hin@@ eland . the event will remember the death of Kaiser August@@ us 2000 years ago .
together with the clubs dedicated to local , regional and historical traditions and characteristics , as well as the W@@ acht@@ berg hi@@ king club , the partnership association , and the Ober@@ bach@@ em am@@ at@@ eur dramati@@ cs club , hi@@ king , rec@@ it@@ als , cooking evening and guidance for school classes , among other things , will be offered , and the Roman history of W@@ acht@@ berg shall be remembered .
the Roman legi@@ onn@@ aire will , for example , talk about his draf@@ ty work in W@@ acht@@ berg ; plants will be presented as living monuments of Roman times , and a hum@@ or@@ ous lesson on the matter of international understanding between a `` Ger@@ man@@ ic '@@ ' group from W@@ acht@@ berg and Roman inv@@ aders will be show@@ c@@ ased .
Aden@@ dor@@ f elementary school has devoted itself to a week@@ -@@ long , Rom@@ an-@@ them@@ ed project .
the Roman week should , once again , enable us to experience the numerous and common , yet , at first glance , no longer visible , tra@@ ces of the Rom@@ ans in W@@ acht@@ berg .
W@@ acht@@ berg town hall will give a small pres@@ entation on the sanctu@@ ary in Ber@@ k@@ um , which was found in 18@@ 79 .
E@@ bol@@ a : the epidemic is putting strain on West Africa '@@ s economy
the E@@ bol@@ a epidemic in West Africa is also a huge hit for the economy .
markets have been abandoned , and international companies are keeping their distance .
the devastating E@@ bol@@ a epidemic has dealt the economy in West Africa a heavy blow .
crops are rot@@ ting in the fields , mines have been deser@@ ted , and the markets have been abandoned . the virus has cost the region de@@ arly .
even some international companies are keeping their distance .
`` The E@@ bol@@ a epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , '@@ ' the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kab@@ er@@ u@@ ka , concluded .
Liberia is the most affected country
`` It is a total catastrophe ; we are losing a lot of money , '@@ ' Al@@ ha@@ ji Bam@@ o@@ go said , who sells clothes in the second largest market in Liberia '@@ s capital city , Mon@@ ro@@ via .
the only people to come to the market are those who want to buy food or disin@@ fec@@ t@@ ant against E@@ bol@@ a .
Liberia is the country most affected by the virus ; here alone more than 600 people have fallen victim to the fever .
the health authorities recently explained that the disease has reached all cor@@ ners of the country .
the virus has even spread to Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria .
in total , more than 1500 people have already died , and thousands more have been infected .
foreign businesses are pulling their employees out
all over countries rich with resources , companies are sus@@ pending operations .
foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees , and several international airlines are no longer flying to affected regions .
even local traders and farmers are reacting : only a few business people are still leaving their home towns to re@@ pl@@ eni@@ sh their supplies .
in some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia , where they have been put under quar@@ ant@@ ine , c@@ ac@@ ao and coffee be@@ ans , to name a few , and which are important for export , are rot@@ ting in the fields .
the farmers do not dare leave their homes for the crops .
food suppliers are scarce
`` People are traveling less and less , '@@ ' Ph@@ illi@@ pe De V@@ re@@ yer , a Pari@@ sian expert on the economy of West Africa said .
for example , a man , who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables , is choosing to stay at home .
the population is , therefore , facing the consequences of the epidemic head on and feeling the pressure : food suppliers are scarce .
the supply of staple foods such as rice is dwind@@ ling in the markets .
at the same time , the image of the region , which is heavily reli@@ ant on international companies , is under threat , and this has far-reaching consequences .
the biggest danger is that international companies are avoiding the region for what is essentially a long time , Ph@@ illi@@ ppe Hu@@ gon , from the French Thin@@ k tank , Iri@@ s , said .
what is crucial is how wide and how long the virus will continue to spread .
investors may get the impression `` that it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia , and , therefore , also to invest , '@@ ' Hu@@ gon warned .
the disease is also bur@@ dening the already strained national budgets of the States
the disease is also bur@@ dening the already strained national budgets of the affected States .
the rating agency Moody '@@ s fears that their budgets are being heavily strained by the high expenditure on the health system , and also by the declining economy .
the African Development Bank has already promised to provide financial aid to the tune of 60 million dollars -LRB- 45 million euros -RRB- to the health systems of affected countries .
the effects in Nigeria , where up to now only a few E@@ bol@@ a cases have been diagnosed , are already noti@@ ceable .
yet the oil-rich region in the south of the Niger Delta is not yet affected .
however , elsewhere , many people are already staying at home for fear of becoming infected .
there is even a marked decline in the number of hotel reservations .
Sho@@ o@@ ters are celebrating their 50th anniversary
the gun club `` T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald '@@ ' in Bern@@ g@@ au is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12th to 14@@ th September .
the preparations for the party are well underway in T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald gun club , which will celebrate 50 years since being established on 12th to 14@@ th September .
the plan for Fri@@ day 12th September is an evening of entertainment provided by the group `` Dorf@@ rock@@ er . '@@ '
the large c@@ ann@@ on will be fired on Satur@@ day at 18 : 00 .
followed by a pleasant evening with `` Sto@@ ap@@ fäl@@ zer Spitz@@ bu@@ am '@@ ' -LRB- Sto@@ ap@@ fäl@@ zer ra@@ sc@@ als -RRB- in a large party tent .
a bra@@ ss band will be c@@ ater@@ ing for the music
the highlights on Sunday will be the fes@@ tiv@@ al service , which will take place at 9 : 30@@ am in the pari@@ sh church , and also the proc@@ essions at 2@@ p@@ m .
there will also be a ranking announcement in the after@@ no@@ on for the national and coun@@ ty shooting competition .
a particularly attractive sight will be the 25 fes@@ tiv@@ al women in their D@@ ir@@ n@@ d@@ ls .
the fes@@ tiv@@ al band will be Bern@@ g@@ au bra@@ ss band .
mayor Wolfgang Wi@@ ld and state secretary Albert Fü@@ ra@@ cker have taken on the sponsor@@ ship .
the original name , `` Schütz@@ en@@ gesellschaft T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald Bern@@ g@@ au '@@ ' -LRB- gun society T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald Bern@@ g@@ au -RRB- dates back to 1907 , when , on 21st March , the club was founded and described as `` social entertainment by means of pi@@ sto@@ l and small-@@ cali@@ ber target practice . '@@ '
in 1937 the Nazi regime closed the club down .
then on 30@@ th April 1964 , 19 young men founded the club again , and launched the `` new '@@ ' gun club `` T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald '@@ ' in Bern@@ g@@ au at Luk@@ as gu@@ est-@@ house .
Karl März and Adolf Ri@@ ed led the club as range officers during its tough early years . the main objective then was to find a club pu@@ b and set up a shooting company .
as early as autumn 1965 the shooting club started out in `` L@@ ein@@ inger '@@ ' guest house with two teams competing against one another .
the following year , target shooting was set up as a sport , organized into seven teams , ranging in ability , all the way up to the local premier league .
the club records roll out every year , and the magic 3@@ 80 rounds were set up for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Mei@@ er .
just as the achievements of the active members has increased , so have the number of members .
once the club pu@@ b `` L@@ ein@@ inger '@@ ' no longer met the requirements of a modern gun club , the club '@@ s management at the time , lead by Joh@@ ann R@@ inn , decided to set up its future home in the bas@@ ement room of the new `` Land@@ gas@@ th@@ of Här@@ tei@@ s '@@ ' -LRB- a country hotel -RRB- .
after 2@@ 700 hours of hard work , Fa@@ ther Stra@@ sser issued the blessing of the church for the new guns room on 8@@ th May 1988 .
one of the greatest highlights in the history of the club was without doubt the 4@@ 4@@ th local shooting competition , which is linked to the formal consec@@ ration of the new shooting flag in July 1991 .
on 2@@ 3@@ r@@ d and 2@@ 4@@ th April 1994 , the shooting club celebrated its 30@@ th anniversary .
in 1995 the c@@ ann@@ on group was founded .
Josef Sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l was the head of the c@@ ann@@ on division .
organizing the Bav@@ arian c@@ ann@@ on Me@@ eting in 2005 was a huge challenge for the `` c@@ ann@@ on sho@@ o@@ ters , '@@ ' and for the club as a whole .
many hours of voluntary work was dedicated by members of the club last year to modernize the rooms and shooting facilities in the Bern@@ g@@ au cour@@ ty@@ ard , making it state of the art .
el@@ even teams go head to head
the spor@@ ting achievements of the shooting club are also impressive .
currently there are a total of el@@ even teams that are taking part in the competi@@ tions : six air ri@@ fl@@ es teams , one pel@@ let gun team , one K@@ K@@ 1 sport target pi@@ sto@@ l team , one youth team and two old-@@ tim@@ er teams .
the first team comprised of L@@ ars Ell@@ rich , Kath@@ ar@@ ina Ell@@ rich , St@@ eff@@ i Grad and K@@ ersti@@ n K@@ ell@@ er@@ mann was promoted to number 1 in the regional league in 201@@ 3@@ /@@ 14 , up from the local premier league -LRB- the highest of the shooting le@@ agues in the AN@@ B -RRB- .
the second team comprised of Ver@@ ena Mo@@ os@@ bur@@ ger , Alex@@ and@@ ra Mei@@ er , E@@ va Schu@@ h@@ mann and To@@ bias Gra@@ m@@ l was promoted from the North local league to the local premier league .
in addition to shooting , events such as Bo@@ ck@@ stechen , Fa@@ sch@@ ing and Köni@@ gs@@ ball , club ex@@ cur@@ sions and also Christmas celebrations are all club traditions .
the sho@@ o@@ ters also attend the pari@@ sh and community fes@@ tiv@@ als .
Tony Ste@@ wart cra@@ shes in return to track

Ste@@ wart drove his battered car to the gar@@ age and then ex@@ ited without speaking to reporters .

he returned to work as an investigation into the tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-@@ year-old Kevin ward J@@ r . , who had stepped on the track to confront Ste@@ wart during a race .
authorities said Fri@@ day that the probe into the cause of the crash will last at least another two weeks .
no decision has been made about whether Ste@@ wart will face charges .
the three-@@ time champion received a big che@@ er when he was introduced before the race .

Bulgaria '@@ s P@@ ris@@ on Off@@ ic@@ ers stage National protest
hundreds of prison workers from across Bulgaria have held a national protest in front the Justice Ministry in the capital So@@ fi@@ a .
in a peaceful demonstration , they have reiter@@ ated their calls for the old working conditions , which were recently changed , to be restored .
higher salaries are also among a list of requests due to be discussed with interim Justice Minister H@@ ri@@ st@@ o Ivanov .
for a month , officers have protested symbo@@ lically against the new working hours , demanding to return to the old 24 hour shifts .
despite the meetings between the prison officers union and the Justice Ministry representatives , an agreement was not reached , Bulg@@ arian National Radio -LRB- B@@ N@@ R -RRB- in@@ forms .

Ukrainian army has abandoned Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k airport
pro-@@ Russian fighters are gaining ground again in East Ukraine .
following heavy fighting in which Russian tank divisions are also said to have participated , the Ukrainian army has today , Mon@@ day , abandoned Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k airport , the rebel stron@@ gh@@ old .
the army announced at the same time that over the past 24 hours , seven soldiers have been killed .
the Ukrainian President , Pet@@ ro Por@@ o@@ schenko , had previously taken appropriate action personally due to the heavy defe@@ ats suffered by his army in the fight against the separatists , and announced changes to the senior leadership of the army without going into detail .
pro-@@ Russian separatists shot down an aircraft
in the fight against Ukrainian government troops , pro-@@ Russian separatists say that they have once again shot down a war@@ plane and two military helicopters .
rebel forces announced on Mon@@ day that around 100 soldiers are also believed to have been injured or killed in fighting in the Don@@ ez@@ k region ; according to Russian agencies .
Co@@ ast@@ guard ships sun@@ k
the rebels also claimed that for the first time they have sun@@ k two of the Ukrainian coast@@ guard '@@ s boats in the Sea of A@@ zo@@ v .
the Ukrainian border police confirmed that two of its ships came under fire on Sunday near to the harbor town of Mari@@ u@@ pol .
during the attack seven border guards were injured , according to a spokes@@ person speaking to the station 11@@ 2.@@ ua in Kiev .
two cre@@ w members are missing .
local media blamed Russia for the incident .
in addition to this , the separatists reported that they have taken control of several towns and villages in the Don@@ ez@@ k region .
diplomatic offensive in M@@ ins@@ k
the Ukrainian contract group are meeting today in the Bel@@ or@@ us@@ sian capital city of M@@ ins@@ k .
representatives from Ukraine , Russia and the OSCE , as well as an ambassador for the separatists from East Ukraine should take part .
prior to the meeting , all parties used their appearance as a means of publicly announcing their demands .
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break their agreements with Russian as a result of their planned deployment to East Europe in response to the Ukrainian crisis .
in Brussels on Mon@@ day , the Secretary General of NATO , An@@ ders Fo@@ gh Ras@@ mus@@ sen , said that NATO will adhere to the NATO-@@ Russia Council formation agreement of 1997 .
nevertheless , the head of NATO accused Russia of `` a fla@@ grant breach '@@ ' of the agreement .
`` Today we must face up to the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner , '@@ ' Ras@@ mus@@ sen said .
documents and statements from the Russian side reveal `` that they consider us as enemies . '@@ '
strengthened NATO presence
Ras@@ mus@@ sen also announced that he wants to strengthen the presence of NATO in East Europe .
a NATO summit meeting in W@@ ales to decide on a `` readiness Action Plan '@@ ' will ensure that `` we will have a more visible NATO presence in the East , if needs be , '@@ ' Ras@@ mus@@ sen explained in Brussels on Mon@@ day .
Kiev and Moscow have agreed to new talks on gas
according to official data , Russia and Ukraine have agreed to new talks to settle disputes over gas .
the negotiations have been scheduled to take place next Satur@@ day , the Russian Minister of Energy , Alexander No@@ wa@@ k , said on Mon@@ day .
the decision of the European Union as to whether they will also send a representative to the talks is yet to be made .
due to the disputes over gas prices , Ukraine has not been receiving fuel from Russia for weeks .
the EU Energy Commissioner , Gün@@ ther O@@ ett@@ inger has recently arbit@@ rated between the two sides .
Ukraine warned that Russia could also suspend the gas supply to Europe .
Europe purchases around one third of its natural gas from Russian sources , a large proportion of which flows through Ukraine .
Merkel puts her foot down : `` L@@ et '@@ s be clear , '@@ ' t@@ oll@@ s will come
once again the Chancellor makes herself clear .
however , there is still no charter explaining all the complex details .
stiff opposition from the CDU against the t@@ oll@@ s is making the CSU increasingly an@@ gri@@ er .
following persistent opposition from the CDU , the Chancellor of Germany , Angela Merkel , has put her foot down with regard to the introduction of t@@ oll@@ s .
`` L@@ et '@@ s be crystal clear : they are mentioned in the coalition agreement , and we will have them , '@@ ' the party leader said on Mon@@ day following a CDU party conference with top committees in Berlin .
but Merkel has not , for the time being , established a detailed model .
`` certain parameters '@@ ' were mentioned in the black@@ -@@ red government program .
the Minister of Transport , Alexander D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt -LRB- CSU -RRB- `` made a suggestion , and we are continuing to work on it . '@@ '
the N@@ W@@ -@@ CDU , however , is insisting that t@@ oll@@ s on all streets be objected against .
Merkel stressed that even the Minister of Finance , Wolfgang Sch@@ äu@@ ble -LRB- CDU -RRB- , is participating construc@@ tively in the consultations on the draft bill .
he has spoken with D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt on the topic and about further possibilities for capit@@ alizing more and investing more in infrastructure , such as developing broad@@ band .
`` There is nothing special about it . '@@ ' On Sunday , Sch@@ äu@@ ble let an article in the Spiegel pass without comment , which stated that his house is testing its own concept for compensating mot@@ or@@ way investors with returns on the t@@ oll@@ s - after the 201@@ 7 election .
as a result , the leader of the CSU , Hor@@ st Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er , warned about developing toll concepts in the cabinet against the Minister in charge .
the deputy leader of the CDU , Arm@@ in La@@ sch@@ et , reinforced his objections .
`` The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and A@@ -@@ roads would get t@@ oll@@ s , '@@ ' the state chairman for North R@@ hin@@ e-@@ West@@ ph@@ alia said .
the fact that Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has now announced that he will discuss this topic again is an important sign .
opposition to the plans has also been received from the CDU state association in Bad@@ en-@@ Wür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg and R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate .
this is due to concerns that a toll would have a negative impact on small-scale border traffic to neighboring states .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has demanded loyalty to the coalition following criticism of the t@@ oll@@ s from members of the CDU .
die Linke -LRB- the L@@ ef@@ ties -RRB- are considering the plans a failure given the arguing within the union .
`` The mess@@ ed up toll is dead , '@@ ' Bern@@ d Ri@@ ex@@ inger , the party leader , told the `` Neuen Os@@ n@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung '@@ ' -LRB- newspaper -RRB- on Mon@@ day .
`` If the toll fails , the Minister fails . '@@ ' D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt wants to introduce an obligation to have toll labels on all German streets as of 2016 .
according to the coalition agreement , car owners in German must not , however , have to face additional charges .
as such , road tax should be offset against t@@ oll@@ s for them .
according to EU law , however , the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers due to their nationality .
genetic disorder often mis@@ diagnosed
a British woman says she spent many years thinking she was going to die after a mis@@ diagnosis .
Kar@@ in Ro@@ d@@ gers spent most of her teen@@ age life believing that she only had years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease .
she actually had Char@@ cot@@ -@@ Mari@@ e-@@ To@@ oth disease -LRB- C@@ MT -RRB- - a group of inherited disorders that damage ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ ine .
charity C@@ MT UK said that mis@@ diagnosis is a common problem among people with C@@ MT because so little is known about the condition .
about 2@@ 3,000 people in the UK are thought to have C@@ MT , which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness , an awkward ga@@ it and cur@@ led to@@ es .
suff@@ er@@ ers can also experience num@@ b@@ ness or pain and the condition is incur@@ able and progressive , meaning symptoms get worse over time .
when Ro@@ d@@ gers was 13 she was under the impression that she suffered from Fried@@ reich '@@ s at@@ ax@@ ia -LRB- FA -RRB- - a condition which had a very poor progno@@ sis .
Ro@@ d@@ gers thought that she was going to be whe@@ el@@ chair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she reached her 3@@ 0s .
the mo@@ ther@@ -of-@@ two , who is now 51 , said : `` As a child I knew I could n@@ '@@ t do the same things as others .
I was falling daily and everything took me longer to do .
I could never roll@@ er-@@ sk@@ ate or sk@@ at@@ e@@ board with other kids and got bul@@ lied at school a lot because of the way I walked and ran .
Ro@@ d@@ gers said when she was aged 13 , after several operations to release her Achil@@ les ten@@ d@@ ons and strai@@ ghten out her feet , she took a peak at her medical notes when her consult@@ ant left the room which said that she suffered from FA .
`` I felt guilty because I '@@ d been no@@ sy and so I did n@@ '@@ t tell anybody , but I did come home , look up the condition at the library and wrote to the FA Association , '@@ ' she said .
when I got the information back I was go@@ b@@ sm@@ acked and in the worst state of panic possible .
I thought I '@@ d be in a whe@@ el@@ chair at 18 and dead by the time I was 25 and in between gradually lose all my ability .
I was going through this on my own and I planned my own funeral .
she said by the time she reached 17 she realis@@ ed that her walking abilities had n@@ '@@ t deteriorated as much as she thought they would have and asked her sur@@ ge@@ on about it .
he just stood up and hu@@ gged me and said ` my de@@ ar I do n@@ '@@ t think you have it , as you would be in a whe@@ el@@ chair now . '
I think you have something a lot less life threatening .
after some genetic testing she was found to have C@@ MT .
`` When he explained what C@@ MT was , I thought I '@@ d drawn the lucky stra@@ w , '@@ ' she said .
charity C@@ MT UK has launched C@@ MT awareness month to try to draw attention to the condition .
retired Serge@@ ant Major Ber@@ ni B@@ ie@@ ther has been working as an artific@@ er ever since the closure of the former military training ground
not a shot has been fired in the former military training ground in Mün@@ sin@@ gen for almost ten years .
nevertheless , deadly ammunition turns up in the center of the bio@@ sphere region of Sw@@ abi@@ an J@@ ura every month .
the sh@@ ells are sometimes so dangerous still that they have to be det@@ on@@ ated there .
a de@@ af@@ ening bang echoes across the center of the bio@@ sphere region upon det@@ on@@ ation .
the last live round to be fired at the military training ground in Mün@@ sin@@ gen was in December 2004 , which , at the end of 2005 , after 110 years of military operation , was closed down .
since then , the 6@@ 500 hectares of land has been the center of the Sw@@ abi@@ an J@@ ura '@@ s bio@@ sphere region , which opened up 13 designated path@@ ways for hi@@ kers and cycli@@ sts .
Washingt@@ on-@@ area business owners '@@ ' tax burden moun@@ ts as economy rebo@@ unds
a rebo@@ unding economy means more customers , higher sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax bills for companies across the country grew modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated , according to new research released last week , and Washingt@@ on-@@ area firms were no exception .
district , Mar@@ yland and Virginia businesses collectively paid $ 2@@ 7.@@ 6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013 , an increase of 3.8 percent over the $ 2@@ 6.@@ 6 billion collected in 2012 .
businesses '@@ ' state and local tax burdens last year expanded by 4.3 percent , to $ 6@@ 71 billion , compared with 3.@@ 9 percent the year before , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after back@@ -to-@@ back years of shrinking bills in 2009 and 2010 .
state taxes rose at a faster cli@@ p , 4.3 percent , than local levi@@ es , 3.@@ 9 percent , according to the study , which was conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the Center on State Ta@@ x@@ ation , a tax policy group .
more than half of the Di@@ strict '@@ s tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from business taxes , while 36 percent of Mar@@ yland '@@ s revenue comes from firms .
Virginia , at 28 percent , generates the least amount of tax revenue , proportion@@ ately , from business .
much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a rebound in companies '@@ ' real estate values , researchers say , which pushed property taxes up 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of sub-@@ 1 percent growth .
while a large share of those gains came from big states such as California , New York and Texas , it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well .
companies in the Di@@ strict , Mar@@ yland and Virginia collectively for@@ ked over $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year , up from $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 - year-@@ over-@@ year growth of 4.@@ 2 percent .
but the apparent boun@@ ce@@ back in property values is n@@ '@@ t doing nearly as much to infl@@ ate state and local tax revenues in Mar@@ yland , where property taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of companies '@@ ' tax bills .
Virginia and D.C. firms pay nearly half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes .
`` What '@@ s happening in Mar@@ yland is that so much of their property , especially the tax base surrounding the D.C. area , is owned either by the government or by non@@ profits , which do n@@ '@@ t pay property taxes , '@@ ' said Dou@@ glas Lin@@ d@@ hol@@ m , executive director of the Center on State Ta@@ x@@ ation .
so Mar@@ yland is forced to rely much more heavily on , for example , its income taxes to pay for the same services you have in other states .
the recent rebound in business tax revenue can not all be attributed to the recovering real estate market .
business incomes also appear to be on the mend , according to the data .
companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $ 2.3 billion , up from $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Mar@@ yland collected $ 1 billion in corporate income tax revenue , the most in the region .
while tr@@ ending in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses is n@@ '@@ t growing at the same pace in all three places .
the Di@@ strict '@@ s rate of growth was level with the national average , at 4.3 percent , while Mar@@ yland '@@ s growth was substantially faster at 4.@@ 9 percent .
only Virginia post@@ ed a bel@@ ow@@ -@@ average tax bill bu@@ mp of 4.@@ 1 percent .
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax by far of the three jurisdictions -LRB- all of which have flat corporate rates -RRB- at 6 percent .
Mar@@ yland '@@ s corporate rate is 8.@@ 25 percent , while the Di@@ strict '@@ s stands at a relatively high 9.@@ 9@@ 75 percent .
a similar study by the U.S. Cham@@ ber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia had lower state and local business taxes and an overall better business tax climate than Mar@@ yland .
the Di@@ strict was n@@ '@@ t evaluated in the study .
despite its advantage , Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south .
North Car@@ ol@@ ina recently signed legislation lowering its corporate rate this year from 6.@@ 9 percent to 6 percent , in line with Virginia , and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year .
if the state continues to meet revenue goals in the coming year , the law could push the state '@@ s business income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 201@@ 7 .
meanwhile , small businesses in the Washington region seem to be far@@ ing better and thus paying more state and local taxes , according to the recent study .
business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - the pass@@ -@@ through structure by which most small firms are organized - in the Di@@ strict , Mar@@ yland and Virginia surged 20 percent last year to $ 2.4 billion , a much faster rate of growth than overall business taxes .
researchers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nationwide are likely to continue this year , with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.@@ 2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year .
however , the Washington area may lag behind as the slowdown in federal spending takes its toll on the region '@@ s labor market .
twin town : German be@@ er for Guang@@ zhou
H@@ ops and mal@@ t - a popular combination even in China .
German be@@ er is enjoying an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt '@@ s twin town in China would like a bre@@ wer@@ y , and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
German be@@ er bre@@ wed in Frankfurt '@@ s twin town of Guang@@ zhou - that is the burning desire of the Chinese officials .
`` We would be deli@@ ghted if a German bre@@ wer@@ y would set up business in our city , '@@ ' the deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese city , Li Y@@ i@@ wei , said this week during a visit to the city by an SPD deleg@@ ate .
time and time again throughout the conversation , the official of the ruling communist party in China came back to this wish of the twelve million people metro@@ polis .
Guang@@ zhou , which is also known as C@@ ant@@ on in Germany , is one of the richest cities in China Li adverti@@ sed .
so , the people also have the buying power to afford German be@@ er .
the H@@ es@@ sian SPD chairman Th@@ or@@ sten Sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ m@@ bel , who led the German delegation , said to the host that he would keeps his ears open in Germany for a possible partner .
`` You do n@@ '@@ t need a lot to make be@@ er : good water , grain and a z@@ est for life , '@@ ' he added over lunch with the senior party member in Guang@@ zhou .
this z@@ est for like already be@@ ams out of Mr Li , he said flat@@ tering the host .
after that , the official from Guang@@ zhou cli@@ cked gl@@ asses with Sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ m@@ bel - albeit with red w@@ ine , which was served with dinner .
the Chinese brand T@@ sing@@ ta@@ o has tra@@ ces leading back to the German art of bre@@ wing .
T@@ sing@@ ta@@ o be@@ er is bre@@ wed according to the German purity law .
more business operations
a second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guang@@ zhou , the deputy party leader , Li , said .
Luf@@ th@@ ans@@ a used to offer such a flight , but canceled it for economic reasons in 2012 .
`` It would be worth it again , '@@ ' the local politician seemed convinced .
`` The business operations between our two cities are continuing to grow . '@@ '
at present , travelers would have to take a de@@ tour via Ch@@ ang@@ sh@@ a in the province of H@@ un@@ an , Li complained .
the administration of the province of Guangdong , whose capital city is Guang@@ zhou , is also hoping for a flight connection .
the deputy governor of the province , Chen Yun@@ xi@@ an , emphasized this wish during his talks with the social democra@@ t .
`` That is a very good idea , '@@ ' Sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ m@@ bel answered - the Chinese deputy minister , Li Jin@@ ju@@ n , an intim@@ ate expert on Germany , no@@ d@@ ded in agreement .
Well@@ -@@ cultivated partnership
the aff@@ able deputy party leader of Guang@@ zhou hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting .
Li Y@@ i@@ wei has already been to the Main , but not in the capacity of his role .
he only took up office this year after his predecessor was removed from office over corruption allegations .
even the party leader of the region , W@@ an Q@@ ing@@ lian , had to leave .
the action taken against the officials from Guang@@ zhou is part of the nationwide campaign against corruption in parties and the administration , which was rigor@@ ously implemented by the head of state , Xi Jinping .
before his career in politics , the new senior politician , Li Y@@ i@@ wei , worked for an American company , which is highly unusual in the Chinese communist party .
before taking office in Guang@@ zhou , he was working as a senior official in Fuj@@ ian , where car manufactur@@ er V@@ W has built a large factory .
Frankfurt has officially adopted more than a dozen twin cities .
Guang@@ zhou , one of the twin cities located some 9@@ 000 kilometers away , is a connection that will be well looked after and cherished by both sides ; for example , with a school exchange .
last year marked the 25 year of German-@@ Chinese relations .
the South China metro@@ polis , which lies on the Pearl River , is almost as strong as the whole of H@@ essen thanks to its economic power .
next year they would like to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros , Li reported .
Jo@@ an Ri@@ vers ' Fami@@ ly Ke@@ eping ` Our fingers crossed '
Jo@@ an Ri@@ vers has been unconscious since her arrival three days ago at a New York City hospital , but her daughter expressed hope today that the 8@@ 1-@@ year-old com@@ edi@@ an will recover from her illness .
`` Th@@ ank you for your continued love and support , '@@ ' Me@@ li@@ ss@@ a Ri@@ vers said in a statement today .

her mother arrived at Mo@@ unt Sinai Ho@@ spit@@ al Th@@ urs@@ day after an emergency call that she was in car@@ di@@ ac arrest at an U@@ pper East Si@@ de clin@@ ic , Yor@@ k@@ ville En@@ do@@ sc@@ op@@ y , sources said .
doctors are intentionally keeping her s@@ ed@@ ated and under close supervision until they '@@ re more comfortable with her condition , which remains `` serious . '@@ '
reaction has been widespread , including overwhelming online support from the likes of Donald trump , Mon@@ tel Willi@@ ams and Kel@@ ly Ri@@ pa .
environmentally friendly vacuum clean@@ ers and increasing wages
strict environmental standards for the future shall apply to all cars and vacuum clean@@ ers that go on sale as of today .
as of September 1st , new vacuum clean@@ ers will come with a label , similar to that on refriger@@ ators and washing machines , which will allow buyers to see key information at a glance , such as the energy efficiency of the app@@ li@@ ance .
new cars that fall under the emissions class `` Euro 6 '@@ ' will receive a higher nit@@ ri@@ c o@@ xide value .
aside from this , there is more money for sc@@ af@@ fol@@ ders : they will receive a minimum wage of 1@@ 0.@@ 25 euros as standard across the whole of Germany .
Amazon buys t@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 0@@ 4 billion
Amazon just confirmed what the Information reported Mon@@ day morning : the online retail@@ er - and video producer , and a hundred other things - is buying video stre@@ aming service t@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 0@@ 4 billion -LRB- $ US@@ 9@@ 70 million -RRB- .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected t@@ wit@@ ch to be bought , but because YouTube was widely expected to be the buyer .
three months ago the sale of t@@ wit@@ ch to Google '@@ s video service , for a cool billion , looked all wra@@ pped up , and the pairing seemed natural .
t@@ wit@@ ch , founded only three years ago as Ju@@ stin@@ .@@ t@@ v , set out to be a general stre@@ aming service - a live version of YouTube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for gam@@ ers to broadcast their in-@@ game fe@@ ats ; a `` YouTube for live gam@@ ing , '@@ ' in Business insider '@@ s words .
t@@ wit@@ ch '@@ s inter@@ face .
and `` let '@@ s play , '@@ ' a gen@@ re of videos in which wi@@ se@@ ac@@ res give -LRB- mostly older -RRB- games the My@@ stery Science Theater treatment , are already popular on YouTube .
the point is , YouTube comes up a lot when describing t@@ wit@@ ch , so the news that YouTube was acquiring t@@ wit@@ ch was greeted with a y@@ a@@ wn , a textbook example of an entrenched tech company buying out a potential competitor .
it '@@ s a mystery why the deal with YouTube fell through , considering it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon .
all we have at the moment is this statement from t@@ wit@@ ch CEO Em@@ met@@ t S@@ hear : `` We chose Amazon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us get there faster . '@@ '
another mystery , frankly , is t@@ wit@@ ch '@@ s incredi@@ ble success .
to s@@ no@@ bs like me who declare that they '@@ d rather play sports than watch them , it '@@ s hard to see the appeal of watching games rather than taking up a controll@@ er myself .
it '@@ s one thing to look over your friend '@@ s shoulder at 3 in the morning as she cre@@ eps through re@@ sident E@@ vi@@ l , and quite another to watch some rand@@ o get 20 head@@ shots in a row in C@@ all of Dut@@ y .
all the games you could be watching right now .
another problem is that many of today '@@ s most popular games are first-@@ person , so watching foot@@ age of them , without controlling the view@@ point yourself , can be a Do It Ri@@ ght-@@ worthy recipe for a head@@ ache .
I concede that spe@@ ed@@ runs , in which the Ro@@ ger B@@ anni@@ sters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time , are enter@@ taining .
but unless someone is a virtu@@ o@@ so at gam@@ ing or hu@@ mo@@ ur , his t@@ wit@@ ch channel is n@@ '@@ t likely to be all that interesting .
but what do sc@@ epti@@ cs like me know ?
t@@ wit@@ ch has 55 million unique visitors monthly and is the four@@ th-@@ largest source of peak internet traffic .
how , exactly , will Amazon capit@@ ali@@ se on this ?
it '@@ s hard to imagine t@@ wit@@ ch being fol@@ ded into Amazon instant Video as elegan@@ tly as YouTube could have just swal@@ lowed t@@ wit@@ ch .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something any company would love to attract : hor@@ des of adverti@@ ser@@ -@@ co@@ v@@ eted young men .
as t@@ wit@@ ch chief S@@ hear said , Amazon and t@@ wit@@ ch `` are both believers in the future of gam@@ ing , '@@ ' and the medium shows no sign of shrinking , even - gul@@ p - as a spec@@ tat@@ or sport .
something is happening on the boun@@ cy cast@@ le at the Bur@@ gg@@ ar@@ ten@@ fest -LRB- cast@@ le garden fes@@ tiv@@ al -RRB- .
the organizers ' idea was right .
despite the heavy down@@ pour of rain on Satur@@ day evening , approximately 1@@ 200 music fans went to the open air fes@@ tiv@@ al in the cast@@ le garden .
admission had to be stopped on occasion .
`` It was anno@@ ying , '@@ ' according to Ron S@@ em , one of the organizers .
Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el lights and fun .
ma@@ x@@ im Sach@@ ra@@ j and Ron S@@ em coined the name `` Ar@@ mul@@ a '@@ ' from two Spanish words .
since the open air cast@@ le garden in Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el was supposed to be@@ am out bright lights during the wide range of da@@ y@@ time and evening shows .
well , you make your own fun anyway .
this was already apparent early on Satur@@ day when the first visitors set off for the open air .
the organizers promised a fes@@ tiv@@ al fit for all generations .
and that is what they delivered .
around the supplies stand located in the me@@ ado@@ ws of the cast@@ le garden , people from Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el , but also gu@@ ests from near and far , made themselves at home .
they followed the first live performance , t@@ apped their feet in time , and enjoyed re@@ fre@@ shments . in short : pure relax@@ ation and enjo@@ y@@ ment .
and that goes for all generations .
wh@@ il@@ st some people spra@@ w@@ led out on blank@@ ets placed on top of the white sand around the be@@ ach bar , which had been car@@ ted in especially , others indul@@ ged in a glass of w@@ ine in the w@@ ine store , and the kids went crazy on the boun@@ cy cast@@ le , which was a huge attraction for the little gu@@ ests .
however , even the children '@@ s face pain@@ ting kept the volunteers ' hands full , in the stric@@ test meaning of the word , as the children rushed to become men , and con@@ j@@ ure up fan@@ ci@@ ful cre@@ ations on their small faces .
the more grown up ones played on the football table or took part in a sk@@ at@@ e@@ board work@@ shop , which the Good@@ foot@@ -@@ Cre@@ w from Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el had organized .
and then the rain came .
shortly before 5 : 30 P@@ M the rain pel@@ ted down onto the visitors ; and families did a run@@ ner in search of somewhere dry .
despite this , the fes@@ tiv@@ al '@@ s attrac@@ tions did not get called off .
`` More people than expected came , '@@ ' Rom S@@ em said , who called the event a `` success all round . '@@ '
as such , nothing is going to stop them from repeating the big party next year .
even though more has to be done in terms of the size and content of the event , the first balance sheet done on Sunday made the voice of the people crystal clear for S@@ em .
he said that one anno@@ ying thing was that they had to stop allowing entry into the event temporarily .
apparently not enough security guards had been book@@ ed with the security company .
the consequence : some people who had already paid could no longer get into the grounds .
feedback has been very good .
in a preliminary and cautious estim@@ ation , the Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el co-@@ organi@@ zer estimated that around 1@@ 200 visitors attended the cast@@ le garden .
there were problems with the sound engineering .
the hip hop band from Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el , blocks ` n ' Ro@@ x , abandoned their performance somewhat un@@ ner@@ ved by these problems .
the engineers could not get a half-@@ decent sound out of it .
a shi@@ sh@@ a lo@@ unge had been planned but could not be built because the t@@ ents could not be delivered to Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el due to a p@@ uncture .
the organi@@ zer insisted that `` they will , however , be there next year . '@@ '
the premier of the Am@@ ul@@ a-@@ O@@ pen@@ -@@ A@@ irs was more than a success in terms of the number of visitors .
and that was with bad weather .
nevertheless , the organizers have made some mistakes , which will be exc@@ used as it was their first time , but which have to be avoided next time round .
the event organizers also had to accept criticism on the social net@@ working site Facebook .
`` Sor@@ ry , but for twelve euros , I really expected more , '@@ ' Mel@@ ani@@ e Mei@@ er comm@@ ented on the event '@@ s page .
`` Un@@ fortunately , you bit off more than you could ch@@ ew , '@@ ' according to E@@ le Z@@ immer@@ mann on the same page .
for others , the te@@ e@@ thing problems were not such a big issue .
I think it is really good that some people are not just standing around talking rub@@ bi@@ sh , but are actually making a real effort to get something up and running .
hat@@ s off ! , '@@ ' St@@ eph@@ ani@@ e J@@ en@@ ß wrote about Am@@ ula .
now the organizers have a year '@@ s time to address these criticisms .
new ra@@ dar dom@@ e in Ber@@ k@@ um : W@@ acht@@ berg '@@ s landmark dwind@@ les
and not as one would expect .
in fact , the structural element , which is ready , is waiting to be installed onto the structure .
but this is just one of many things that need doing : almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation ra@@ dar T@@ IRA , the case , known as the ra@@ dar dom@@ e , is to be completely rebuilt .
with a diam@@ eter of 4@@ 7.5 meters , the new ra@@ dar dom@@ e will be somewhat smaller than the old one .
that said , the size will still be a world record .
the final phase in completing the new case is to change the cap
the top quarter of the old case will be separated and lifted by a c@@ rane .
after that , the last quarter of the new case will be put in place .
as long as the weather is on their side , this should take place at the start of this week .

will the Bur@@ g@@ ver@@ eine -LRB- cast@@ le clubs -RRB- get back together again ?
recently there have been a lot of disputes between both of the cast@@ le groups in Wol@@ frat@@ sh@@ au@@ sen .
the bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om is now contemplating the possibility of working together .
as an example for the reconstruction of the cast@@ le in Wol@@ frat@@ sh@@ au@@ sen , the dec@@ eased Richard Dim@@ b@@ ath , the former chair@@ men of Wol@@ frat@@ sh@@ aus@@ er Bur@@ g@@ fre@@ unde -LRB- Wol@@ frat@@ sh@@ au@@ sen cast@@ le friends -RRB- , led the project in the French Gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
up until a year ago , there was a good atmosphere among the cast@@ le club and the cast@@ le friends group in Wol@@ frat@@ sh@@ au@@ sen .
their points of view are now markedly different with regard to how the history of Wol@@ frat@@ sh@@ au@@ sen cast@@ le and the possible reconstruction of it should be handled .
now the two are coming together : there should soon be talks about a joint venture .
Tor@@ sten S@@ j@@ ö@@ berg -LRB- cast@@ le club -RRB- and Herbert Pi@@ ff@@ l -LRB- cast@@ le friends -RRB- , both members of the board , confirmed this in answer to our newspaper '@@ s qu@@ ery .
`` I have rung Mr Pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we get together , '@@ ' S@@ j@@ ö@@ berg reported .
in his opinion , all members of each club could come together again in the future .
this would enable qu@@ icker and more visible success to be achieved .
whereas the cast@@ le friends , and the recently dec@@ eased Richard Dim@@ b@@ ath right up until the bitter end , had their eyes on reconstruc@@ ting the cast@@ le in the mountain forest , the cast@@ le club , with S@@ j@@ ö@@ berg , want to `` develop and bring the premises to life '@@ ' in its original place .
Herbert Pi@@ ff@@ l , the deputy chairman of cast@@ le friends , said himself that he was very pleased about the call .
he has been pre@@ si@@ ding over cast@@ le friends since the death of Dim@@ b@@ ath .
a new Chair@@ person will be found mi@@ d September during a members ' meeting .
at the moment , the club has around 40 members according to the 74 year old .
`` After the death of my friend , Richard Dim@@ b@@ ath , we ad@@ jour@@ ned the club '@@ s activities initially out of respect . '@@ ' This `` period of thought '@@ ' has been necessary to `` think about how it can proceed . '@@ '
according to Pi@@ ff@@ l , the new Chair@@ person will then enter into discussions with the cast@@ le club .
until then , the cast@@ le friends can get on with the current atmospheric picture within their group .
Pi@@ ff@@ l said that , at the moment , they still do not have a candidate for the chair .
`` Ho@@ w@@ ever , I am confident that we will find someone . '@@ ' He himself does not want to stand for it because he lives in Bad T@@ öl@@ z .
the new Chair@@ person should be in Wol@@ frat@@ sh@@ au@@ sen .
the man from T@@ öl@@ z would , however , `` like to continue working with them '@@ ' on the project .
the different points of view on the subject of reconstruction will continue to exist for some time in Pi@@ ff@@ l '@@ s eyes .
he acknowledges Dim@@ b@@ ath as a `` mission@@ ary , '@@ ' who always believed in the reconstruction of the cast@@ le .
two similar projects , which are well under way in Austria and France , show that this idea is no easy task .
but with a high number of participants among the population , as well as some volunteers from all over the world , it will become a tourist magnet .
Pi@@ ff@@ l : `` E@@ ven I was skeptical at first .
however , with time , I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to press ahead with the project . '@@ ' It could create a `` unique characteristic '@@ ' for the city of ra@@ fts@@ men .
otherwise , there is nothing here .
in addition , the project would be financed by EU grants , visi@@ tor ti@@ ckets and potential sponsors , Pi@@ ff@@ l believes .
`` The idea of reconstruction is , therefore , something that I personally do not want to simply abandon . he hopes that the cast@@ le club will move towards this idea somewhat .
their aim to first of all document the history `` is important and good . '@@ '
then , we will see .
smart ways to save on college textbooks
with the cost of college textbooks sur@@ passing $ 1,000 a year for many students , so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be s@@ op@@ hom@@ ore Mat@@ t Schroeder came up with a smart way to tri@@ m costs .
he worked out a system of borrowing books from up@@ per@@ class@@ men , offering nominal compensation to get them to delay selling them back .
`` My calculus book that usually costs $ 180 , I got for the sem@@ ester for $ 10 and a Ch@@ ick@@ -@@ fil@@ -@@ A bis@@ cu@@ it , '@@ ' says Schroeder , 19 , who atten@@ ds Co@@ ven@@ ant College in Georgia .
required texts for his last sem@@ ester would have cost $ 4@@ 30 , he says .
he spent $ 120 .
the College Board says the average student will spend more than $ 1,@@ 200 a year on textbooks and school supplies , but students have a variety of options for managing these costs .
online outlets and creative approaches like Schroeder '@@ s are increasingly the go@@ -@@ to choices for students .
r@@ enting textbooks is on the rise , allowing students to use a book for the sem@@ ester , often at a significant discount to buying .
Ne@@ eb@@ o In@@ c , which operates more than 250 campus book@@ stores , says textbook rent@@ als have doubled since 2011 .
industry research shows that about one-@@ fourth of books at college book@@ stores in this past spring sem@@ ester were r@@ ented , says Ne@@ eb@@ o Vice President Tre@@ vor Me@@ yer .
fewer than half of all texts are purchased at campus book@@ stores , according to the National Association of College stores trade association .
here is the 10@@ 1 on the best ways to score a deal .
buying online
some new book prices can be one-third of what you might find at the campus book@@ store if you go online .
the nin@@ th edi@@ tion of `` calculus '@@ ' by Ron Lar@@ son , Bru@@ ce Ed@@ wards , and Robert Ho@@ st@@ et@@ ler carries a list price of nearly $ 2@@ 90 but can be purchased new for $ 2@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 99 at speci@@ alty textbook retail@@ er Che@@ gg@@ .com .
buying used
if you do not mind other people '@@ s notes or wear and te@@ ar , used texts are a good option .
`` calculus '@@ ' is selling for $ 9@@ 3.@@ 49 used on Che@@ gg@@ .com .
Mat@@ t Cas@@ ad@@ ay , 25 , a senior at Bri@@ gh@@ am Young University , says he had paid 42 cents on Amazon@@ .com for a used copy of `` Strategic Medi@@ a Dec@@ i@@ sions : understanding The Business End Of The advertising Business . '@@ '
the book was selling for $ 48 new .
academics like In@@ grid Bra@@ c@@ ey , director of the University of Massachusetts at Am@@ her@@ st '@@ s College Wi@@ th@@ out walls , suggest students check with their professors to see if previous edi@@ tions are acceptable .
sometimes the up@@ dates are not relevant to the class@@ work .
if so , old edi@@ tions can often be found for a tiny fraction of the cost of the latest version .
besides Che@@ g@@ g and Amazon , e@@ Bay In@@ c '@@ s Hal@@ f@@ .com is a popular alternative for used books .
r@@ enting
r@@ enting your textbooks is worth considering if you take reasonable care of them , you remember to return them and you do not care to own them after you complete the class .
you can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of buying a book new .
for example , a student could rent `` calculus '@@ ' for the length of the sem@@ ester for about $ 20 .
know the rules of the store you rent from , including any penalties you could be assessed for taking notes , highlighting , or wear and te@@ ar .
R@@ enter , bew@@ are : if you fail to return the book , penalties can actually exceed the cost of buying it new .
E@@ -@@ books
getting e-@@ books instead of traditional texts is another option .
sometimes those books are essentially r@@ ented by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distribu@@ tors such as Amazon@@ .com , Che@@ g@@ g and Bar@@ nes & Nob@@ le In@@ c .
Che@@ g@@ g will rent `` calculus '@@ ' for six months for about $ 61 .
Bra@@ c@@ ey says students in literature classes can often find the best bar@@ gains since many classi@@ cs are now available to down@@ load for free , while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive .
no matter what , shop around .
Joe G@@ ault , 29 , who is about to enter P@@ ep@@ per@@ d@@ ine Law School , recommen@@ ds using the IS@@ B@@ N number to price books since it ensures you are shopping for the right text .
before ordering online , G@@ ault says , be sure to check if the book is actually in stock .
he learned that lesson the hard way .
a book he purchased was back@@ -@@ ordered for four weeks , and he ended up paying full price at the college book@@ store .
why the guardians of the gal@@ ax@@ y could n@@ '@@ t save the box office
Sy@@ l@@ vest@@ er St@@ all@@ one '@@ s The Ex@@ pen@@ dab@@ les 3 has made back less than $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the US , while sin City : a D@@ ame to K@@ ill For has made back only $ 12 million of its $ 70 million budget .
the Cameron Dia@@ z vehicle Sex tape took only $ 14@@ .@@ 6 million in its opening weekend , while children '@@ s films such as How To Tra@@ in Y@@ our Dra@@ gon 2 are also showing disappointing box office returns .
an article from Tele@@ graph film critic Rob@@ bie Col@@ lin indicates that , when it comes to children '@@ s movies , the poor quality of the films themselves might be to blame .
Col@@ lin called 2014 the `` the worst '@@ ' year yet for children '@@ s films , and described How To Tra@@ in Y@@ our Dra@@ gon 2 as a merely `` functional '@@ ' fantasy sequ@@ el .
but when it comes to film pit@@ ched at a slightly older market , it appears that the issue might not necessarily lie with the quality of the films themselves .
in July , entertainment We@@ ek@@ ly compared the average C@@ inem@@ a@@ S@@ core and Met@@ ac@@ ri@@ tic ratings for every summer release playing on at least 2,000 screens between May '@@ s Mem@@ orial Day holiday and July 20 , for 2013 and for this year .
the results , which take the opinion of both cin@@ ema audiences and film critics into account , suggest that this year '@@ s crop of films are of similar cali@@ br@@ e last year '@@ s hits .
some commentators have suggested that changing viewing habits and the increased popularity of web stre@@ aming services such as Net@@ fli@@ x may be to blame .
director J@@ on F@@ av@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on Dis@@ ney '@@ s forthcoming J@@ ung@@ le Book film , told the web@@ site Hollywood Reporter : `` I think times are changing . '@@ '
we have to acknowledge that and not try to ch@@ ase what used to be .
in contrast to Hollywood '@@ s current box office slump , Net@@ fli@@ x recently saw revenue from its stre@@ aming content service reach $ 1.@@ 2@@ bn , almost doubling last year '@@ s figure of $ 8@@ 3@@ 7@@ m .
last summer , director Steven Spiel@@ berg critici@@ sed studi@@ os for relying too much on com@@ ic book franch@@ ises , and predicted a Hollywood `` meltdown . '@@ '
in light of the current downturn , some commentators are arguing that his dire prophecy may have held some truth to it .
with summer 2015 set to usher in a sl@@ ate of potential big box office hits , including A@@ ven@@ gers : age of Ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons and Jur@@ assi@@ c World , other figures within the film industry are feeling more optimistic .
X-@@ M@@ en producer Simon Kin@@ berg recently described the drop in box office tak@@ ings as simply `` cyclical , '@@ ' telling Hollywood Reporter : `` N@@ ext summer will be the biggest box@@ -@@ office summer in history , and nobody will be worrying about the business . '@@ '
a few years ago , when the second table ten@@ nis regional division was canceled in an attempt to stream@@ line the le@@ agues , a step in the right directions was taken .
now , the German table ten@@ nis association has introduced an additional , third league into the program .
the consequence : any team that has not been promoted , has been dem@@ oted .
for example , G@@ öt@@ tin@@ gen '@@ s top class team , tor@@ p@@ edo , avoided demo@@ tion in the premier league releg@@ ation , but will now play in the fifth division as of next season .
the tor@@ p@@ edo '@@ s women '@@ s team remain in the fourth division despite their super@@ b cle@@ an-@@ sweep in the Region@@ alli@@ ga .
the tor@@ p@@ edo boys and girls are starting in the Lo@@ wer Sa@@ x@@ ony Liga , just like the la@@ ds from S@@ C We@@ ende .
the S@@ G L@@ eng@@ lern and tor@@ p@@ edo reserves are stepping up into the new Verb@@ and@@ s@@ lig@@ a , but there are no longer any clubs from G@@ ö@@ tt@@ ing@@ ern in the Landes@@ lig@@ a .
for the women , T@@ TV Gei@@ sm@@ ar does play in the Verb@@ and@@ s@@ lig@@ a , and the tor@@ p@@ edo '@@ s second team plays in the Landes@@ lig@@ a .
from a structural point of view , this seems to be a better regional division , when in fact , it is just the new Southern Regional Premier League .
stepping up into this are : T@@ S@@ V Se@@ ul@@ ingen , V@@ f@@ B Lö@@ ding@@ sen , tor@@ p@@ edo III , Gei@@ sm@@ ar , Ein@@ be@@ ck , H@@ ammen@@ st@@ ed@@ t , Bo@@ ven@@ der S@@ V , Lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen , F@@ C Wes@@ er and T@@ T@@ C .
D@@ ran@@ sf@@ eld and S@@ C We@@ ende represent the area in the regional league , whereas T@@ T@@ C II , Rot@@ -@@ Wei@@ ß , Bo@@ ven@@ der S@@ V II and T@@ TV Gei@@ sm@@ ar II and III represent the area in the regional division . the Regional Premier League for women is at least kicking off with a good start .
Gün@@ ter@@ sen , T@@ T@@ C and T@@ TV Gei@@ sm@@ ar II are all here as part of the party .
in the regional league , tor@@ p@@ edo III and S@@ atten@@ haus@@ en@@ /@@ W@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sh@@ au@@ sen are taking to the field .
with each of the nine teams
S@@ C We@@ ende sends a girl into the small regional league .
even the regional league '@@ s re@@ lay team for SC@@ W boys , which is where tor@@ p@@ edo II is also starting , is not complete .
as for the regional division , Gei@@ sm@@ ar , Tus@@ p@@ o We@@ ende and Bo@@ ven@@ der S@@ V are heading into their season .
in the first season of the new@@ ly-@@ founded regional association , both district divisions from G@@ öt@@ tin@@ gen are starting out with each of the nine teams .
as for the West re@@ lay team ; that is made up of Rot@@ -@@ Wei@@ ß II , Bo@@ ven@@ der S@@ V III , Lau@@ b@@ ach II , tor@@ p@@ edo IV and V , M@@ TV Gr@@ one , D@@ ran@@ sf@@ el@@ der S@@ C II , M@@ iel@@ en@@ hau@@ sen and S@@ G L@@ eng@@ lern II .
S@@ atten@@ haus@@ en@@ /@@ W@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sh@@ au@@ sen , Nikol@@ aus@@ berg and Land@@ ol@@ f@@ sh@@ au@@ sen are some of the teams making up the East re@@ lay team .
the women '@@ s district division is made up of S@@ atten@@ haus@@ en@@ /@@ W@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sh@@ au@@ sen II , Bil@@ sh@@ au@@ sen , Hem@@ eln , Se@@ ul@@ ingen II , Tus@@ p@@ o We@@ ende and S@@ G R@@ hum@@ e .
that is much better than the district of Oster@@ ode , where there are no longer any female teams at a district level .
it is remarkable that none of the six second division teams in the district achieved their potential . the innovative and bu@@ st@@ ling district committee are going to have to come up with something .
NATO summit : first protests in New@@ port and Car@@ di@@ ff
there have been protests over the weekend by those opposed to the Nato summit in New@@ port .
on Satur@@ day , hundreds gathered in New@@ port city centr@@ e for an anti-@@ NATO march .
and on Sunday in Car@@ di@@ ff , around 150 people came together at Car@@ di@@ ff '@@ s coun@@ ty hall for what was described as a counter-@@ summit .
Stephen Fair@@ cl@@ ough has been following developments for us over the weekend and has spoken to protesters who have trav@@ elled from Bri@@ d@@ gend to Belgium .
te@@ ens air@@ lifted from Blue Mo@@ un@@ tains
two teen@@ age b@@ ush@@ wal@@ kers have been win@@ ched to safety after spending the night str@@ anded in the N@@ S@@ W Blue Mo@@ un@@ tains .
the 16@@ -year-old girl and 18@@ -year-old man went hi@@ king just after mid@@ day on Sunday at Go@@ v@@ etts Le@@ ap in Black@@ he@@ ath .
concerned relatives called police about 8@@ p@@ m when they had n@@ '@@ t returned home .
a search party involving local police and rescue squ@@ ad was sent out and the pair were found about 11@@ p@@ m near bri@@ dal veil F@@ alls .
the girl had injured her kne@@ e and the man had fallen and hit his head .
officers remained with the pair overnight and they were win@@ ched out on Mon@@ day morning .
they were taken by am@@ bul@@ ance in a stable condition to Blue Mo@@ un@@ tains Ho@@ spit@@ al .
anti-@@ government protests escalate in Pakistan
around 1000 protesters have been forced out of the P@@ TV buildings by soldiers , according to the Minister of Information , Per@@ v@@ ai@@ z Ras@@ hid .
after a good half an hour or so , the station began broad@@ casting again .
the director of P@@ TV , Ath@@ ar Far@@ o@@ o@@ q , said that demonstrators armed with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial offices .
there was no mentioned of the number of people killed or injured .
the demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the He@@ ad of Government , accusing him of vote ri@@ gging .
the police announced that on Mon@@ day , around one kilometer away from the residence of the Prime Minister , Nawaz Sharif , approximately 3000 demonstrators clas@@ hed with security forces .
according to statements released by the hospital , a police officer was injured .
at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured at the weekend when demonstrators attempted to gain access to Sharif '@@ s residence .
they are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister .
following a meeting in the army '@@ s headquarters on Sunday evening , the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict , stating there was `` no time to waste or a need to use violence . '@@ '
the statement also announced that : `` The army remains bound by its duty to ensure the safety of the State . '@@ '
the escalating violence stir@@ red up concern that the military may have to intervene , a military that has already revol@@ ted on many occasions in the past .
the above protests , led by Im@@ ran Khan , an opposition politician , and Tah@@ i@@ ru@@ l Q@@ ad@@ ri , a pre@@ acher , have been ongoing since independence day on 14 August .
Sharif is refusing to step down .
on Sunday Khan and Q@@ ad@@ ri called upon their supporters to per@@ severe .
`` We will not leave until we have forced Sharif to resign , '@@ ' Khan said .
Q@@ ad@@ ri made similar comments :
Khan accuses Sharif of having fraudul@@ ently won the parliamentary vote last May .
Q@@ ad@@ ri is demanding the resignation of both the central and provincial governments .
a provi@@ sional government should then reform the voting system , and call new elections .
more than 40,000 members of the security forces have been deployed to protect the government district .
at first , the demonstrators led a peaceful protest in front of the parliament building . then , at the weekend , Khan and Q@@ ad@@ ri called upon them to force entry into Sharif '@@ s residence .
after its second win of the season , H@@ üt@@ tel@@ dor@@ f is in third place on the table .
a bitter week came to an end for Rap@@ id on Sunday with a 2 : 0 win over Gr@@ ö@@ dig .
co@@ ach Zor@@ an B@@ ari@@ sic , whose team reached an interim low at the end of the Europa League on Th@@ urs@@ day , said that `` the victory is very liberating . '@@ '
the captain and go@@ al@@ ke@@ ep@@ er , St@@ eff@@ en H@@ of@@ mann , who climbed up to third place with Grün@@ -@@ Wei@@ ß , confirmed that `` the sense of achievement was extremely important . '@@ '
Sch@@ ra@@ mm@@ el '@@ s dream goal has led Rap@@ id on to a road to victory . two winning seas@@ ons show that Rap@@ id have reacted in the right way to the disappointment experienced against Helsinki , and they reach the end of the international season with heightened mor@@ ale .
`` We wanted to show a positive reaction , '@@ ' the defender Thomas Sch@@ ra@@ mm@@ el said , whose magni@@ fic@@ ent and skill@@ ful corner in the 14@@ th minute set them on a winning course .
`` I thought I '@@ d build up all of the frustration from Th@@ urs@@ day , and sm@@ ashed it into the top of the net , '@@ ' the 2@@ 6@@ -year old said s@@ mi@@ ling .
13@@ th of November 2010 was , until now , the last time that Sch@@ ra@@ mm@@ el had scored in a team from the Bundes@@ lig@@ a , and that was with Ri@@ ed .
his first champion@@ ships goal at Rap@@ i@@ d-@@ Dre@@ ss will , therefore , always be a special memory for him .
`` That is something quite special for me , I am Rap@@ id offspring , '@@ ' Sch@@ ra@@ mm@@ el said .
due to Mario P@@ av@@ eli@@ c '@@ s recent pel@@ vis injury , Sch@@ ra@@ mm@@ el moved from playing left back to right back , where he also did a very good job .
he had enough experience to be able to play in the mir@@ r@@ ored position .
he deserved the goal , B@@ ari@@ sic stated . he has already achieved some assi@@ sts this year .
the team shows character . Sch@@ ra@@ mm@@ el also crossed the ball over to H@@ of@@ mann after the first hour , which led to the decisive 2 : 0 victory .
but before that , even the fans could have kept the score .
`` Th@@ ank God we had some luck today , '@@ ' Sch@@ ra@@ mm@@ el noted , all@@ u@@ ding to the gap between the efforts made and results achieved in the past weeks : `` The results were not justified , but the games were always better when compared to last year . '@@ '
B@@ ari@@ sic even decided that the team had previously played `` better in other games than today , '@@ ' and against `` the strongest team to play in the stadium this season . '@@ '
these are the first three points since 2@@ 6@@ th July , and therefore prove that the structure of the team is intact despite the setbacks : `` Today , my team has shown that they have character . '@@ '
for him , what is just as ple@@ asing is : `` The fact that we have finally played to a clean sheet again . '@@ '
a lot of work was done during the internal football break . the unfortunate circumstances that led to the absence of Bri@@ an Be@@ hr@@ end@@ t , Mario P@@ av@@ eli@@ c , Christopher Di@@ bon , Den@@ i Al@@ ar and Michael Schimp@@ els@@ berger , as well as the fact that S@@ r@@ d@@ jan Gra@@ ho@@ vac , St@@ ef@@ an St@@ ang@@ l and Phi@@ lip@@ p Sch@@ ob@@ es@@ berger joined the first team , is what makes this success all the more valuable .
`` We must not forget that , '@@ ' B@@ ari@@ sic said , who has lost players in the last three days , including Be@@ hr@@ end@@ t and P@@ av@@ eli@@ c , `` who recently were very stable . '@@ '
the international football break therefore has to be used `` to li@@ ck wounds and to improve physically a bit , '@@ ' B@@ ari@@ sic explained , who has five under 2@@ 1@@ s in his ranks .
for one of whom , captain H@@ of@@ mann , the break came in particularly useful .
he ben@@ ds over backwards for the team , ignoring any pain .
especially during these difficult times , he showed that he is a very important player for us , '@@ ' B@@ ari@@ sic stated .
before being substitu@@ ted in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute , H@@ of@@ mann not only gave structure to Rap@@ id '@@ s game , but also scored the second goal .
for the 3@@ 3@@ -year old , who played his 3@@ 50th game in the Bundes@@ lig@@ a , it was his first goal since November 2 , 2013 -LRB- 4 : 2 against Ad@@ mi@@ ra -RRB- .
H@@ of@@ mann : `` We must not think that all is now well . '@@ ' `` I am sure we had a bit of luck on our side , but , at some point , that luck had to come back to us .
it was high time , '@@ ' H@@ of@@ mann said .
of course , he spoke about focused and continued work : `` You do n@@ '@@ t have to always see things black and white .
we have n@@ '@@ t been playing as badly in recent weeks as it has been made out to be .
however , we must n@@ '@@ t think that all is now well .
his importance to the team is something that he could not deny .
after all , it is a very young team , which , I am able to help at the moment .
they hold on to me in certain phases , '@@ ' H@@ of@@ mann said .
Gr@@ ö@@ dig '@@ s co@@ ach , Michael Ba@@ ur and his team have little to blame themselves for .
he is sorry about the quick counter goal , describing it as `` a kind of magic goal , '@@ ' as well as the normal goal scored by Nu@@ tz in the 40@@ th minute , which was wrong@@ fully denied by the refer@@ ee , Kol@@ leg@@ ger .
the only criticism I can make about the team is that we were sometimes not precise enough up@@ field .
because we had far to few goals .
center back , Ma@@ xi@@ mili@@ an Kar@@ ner thought the same : `` It started off badly , but we then found our feet , and even scored a goal .
all in all , we could have had more .
silence prevails beneath this tre@@ et@@ op
last Fri@@ day , when giving out the puzzle on the summer series `` My piece of R@@ hö@@ n happiness , '@@ ' we showed a mighty tree tr@@ unk .
there are still several of these giant trees in the region ; the example shown is the `` Gei@@ ss@@ ru@@ hei@@ che , '@@ ' an o@@ ak tree , which stands above the village of Unter@@ weis@@ sen@@ br@@ un@@ n .
a rock@@ y foot@@ path leads up to the somewhat 600 year old o@@ ak tree .
you walk past en@@ clo@@ sures , bas@@ alt c@@ air@@ ns and a sea of stones .
the tree is located just below the Bau@@ er@@ s@@ berg '@@ s stone quar@@ ry , one kilometer north of the street to Wei@@ s@@ b@@ ach .
the natural mon@@ ument looks energetic ; it to@@ wers above the other trees in the area , and , being more than eight meters in size , it reminds you of an American giant Sequ@@ o@@ ia .
a small Buddh@@ a on top of a tree stu@@ b indicates that this is a spiritual or my@@ stic place .
despite intensive research , there are only clu@@ es to the origins of the name .
D@@ r Wolfgang Schnei@@ der has , once again , consulted the Bi@@ sch@@ of@@ sh@@ eim Archi@@ ves , and asked elderly people from Unter@@ weis@@ sen@@ br@@ un@@ n in order to find out what it has to do with the Gei@@ ss@@ ru@@ hei@@ che .
the results of his investigation revealed a less color@@ ful explanation of the name .
according to his research , up to around 80 years ago , the go@@ at her@@ ders are said to have led their animals out of Unter@@ weis@@ sen@@ br@@ un@@ n along the ar@@ du@@ ous , cleared and st@@ on@@ eless me@@ ado@@ ws .
the her@@ d@@ s@@ men , exhausted after the ascent , rested at the foot of the tree .
since then , the area has won back its significance , because her@@ ds of go@@ ats , once again gra@@ zing the me@@ ado@@ ws .
in addition , Schnei@@ der also discovered that the region has been declared the core area in the bio@@ sphere reserve .
one should exercise caution when tre@@ ading over the mass of stone because the sun@@ -@@ war@@ med bas@@ alt is also a popular where@@ ab@@ outs for the European vi@@ per .
a hi@@ king tra@@ il leads from Unter@@ weis@@ sen@@ br@@ un@@ n up to the tree , but it is somewhat hidden .
further tra@@ ils are sign@@ post@@ ed , which lead up towards Hoch@@ r@@ hö@@ n and offer an extensive hike .
where is the mo@@ ated cast@@ le ?
a mo@@ ated cast@@ le , which we looked for as part of our next challenge , is , of course , rather hard to find way up high .
the reflection in the mo@@ at already provides a good impression of the structure , but we do have some historical buildings in the district , and the building portra@@ it may just be a good example of this .

R@@ enzi obser@@ ves how the government-@@ friendly daily newspaper , La Re@@ pub@@ bli@@ ca , describes the appointment of Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , who was also seen as the fa@@ vo@@ ur@@ ite by the government , as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and of his own position in the EU .
he expects it to provide a boost for his `` Reform Pack@@ age '@@ ' in Italy .
R@@ enzi hopes , not least , to be able to thus qu@@ ie@@ ten the left-wing party basis which is always stir@@ ring against him , for Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini is considered to be one of their group - albeit one of the more moderate .
in opposition to the conservative representatives , Commission President Jean-Claude Jun@@ cker and the Pol@@ e Donald Tus@@ k , who was named as Council President , were voted in , so the prevailing opinion in Rome , in order to achieve a political balance .
for the Chief diplomat of the EU will also serve as the Deputy to Commission President Jun@@ cker .
the agreement of the EU-@@ Parliament is considered to be safely secured .
if this were not the case , then State President Gi@@ or@@ gi@@ o Na@@ poli@@ tan@@ o would hardly have called the nomination of the 41 year-old politician from the ruling Democratic Party -LRB- PD -RRB- `` an important recognition '@@ ' of the role of Italy in the EU .
la Re@@ pub@@ bli@@ ca is optimistic that Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , who has held high office over two decades in different governments , and who is known for her ambition , will be able to meet the `` enormous challenges . '@@ '
the woman , who was born in Rome , is married and has two daughters .
the qualified doctor of political science began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the former Democ@@ rati@@ ci di S@@ inist@@ ra -LRB- left wing democrats -RRB- , which merged with the Catholic centr@@ e party , Mar@@ gh@@ er@@ ita , in 2008 , to form today '@@ s social democratic party -LRB- PD -RRB- .
in 1999 Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini became Vice President for three years of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth .
the election of 2001 saw her take high office with a place on the council of the Left W@@ ing Democrats , working in the foreign policy department and then becoming its head .
she was responsible for traditional cornerst@@ ones of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East ; became known for her prepar@@ atory work to the operation of NATO in Afghanistan , in which Italy has a participating contingent ; and she promoted relations with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA .
since 2008 she has been a member of the Cham@@ ber of De@@ puties , in which she serves as an expert on Def@@ ence and European and International Affairs .
when R@@ enzi became Premier in February 2014 , he appointed Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini as his Foreign Minister .
if the PD today enjoys a better relationship with the strong freedom movement in the country , which contributed to the more than 40 percent votes for the Party in the EU elections , then it was Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini who played a leading role in that , as is strongly believed in PD circles .
the claims in Brussels that the new EU-@@ Foreign Minister has too little diplomatic experience and therefore lacks clout , is re@@ but@@ ted by the PD .
in Brussels , the realistic stance taken by Lo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini in the Ukrainian crisis have been attacked and deni@@ gr@@ ated , particularly by the Polish members and those representing the Baltic States .
she is a supporter of Pipeline South Stream , run by the Russian firm Gas@@ prom , through which Russian natural gas is to be transpor@@ ted directly to southern Europe , by-@@ passing Ukraine . this will also make Italy '@@ s own energy secure .
after R@@ enzi had assumed his position as EU-@@ Chairman in July , Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini embarked on her first state visit to Moscow .
photos showing her shaking hands with Putin were received in Brussels with indignation , as was the fact that she invited the Kremlin chief to an economic summit in Milan in October .
a total of nine people began their training course on Mon@@ day , at em@@ z-@@ Han@@ auer in Nab@@ burg .
they include a tra@@ ine@@ e , who had already completed another course in the same company .
the new tra@@ ine@@ e employees will receive training for four future job areas : electronics engineers -LRB- three tra@@ ine@@ es -RRB- ; mech@@ at@@ ron@@ ics engineers or techni@@ cians -LRB- two -RRB- ; tool mechan@@ ics -LRB- two -RRB- and process engineers -LRB- two -RRB- .
all the tra@@ ine@@ es come from the coun@@ ty of Sch@@ wand@@ or@@ f : To@@ bias Brau@@ n and Thomas B@@ üch@@ er@@ l from Schwarz@@ ach , St@@ ef@@ an Bri@@ ck@@ l and Flori@@ an Re@@ wi@@ tzer from Schmid@@ g@@ aden , Johannes be@@ er from Neun@@ burg vor@@ m Wald , Feli@@ x Dom@@ ai@@ er from Ober@@ vi@@ ech@@ t@@ ach , Daniel Sor@@ gen@@ frei and Se@@ bas@@ ti@@ an Zah@@ ner from P@@ frei@@ m@@ d , as well as Ferdinand Stre@@ b@@ l from Te@@ un@@ z .
the new tra@@ ine@@ es had previously attended middle and junior high schools .
from W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day until Fri@@ day , the tra@@ ine@@ es of all the various ages were going to a Team Building event in Ober@@ am@@ mer@@ g@@ au , which included among other things an all-@@ day hike and ra@@ f@@ ting on the In@@ n River .
the company has 4@@ 35 employees throughout Germany and 9@@ 50 worldwide .
the number of tra@@ ine@@ es across all age-@@ groups tot@@ als 27 .
France '@@ s Socialists should ` shut up and sort France out ' , Fran@@ co@@ is Hollande '@@ s key ally says
Mr V@@ alls called on the deeply divided Left to `` show its aff@@ ection '@@ ' for the em@@ battled Socialist president , whose re@@ shu@@ ff@@ le has failed to meet the approval of the vast majority of French .
the president deserves everyone '@@ s respect , he deserves our loy@@ ality , he deserves our support .
`` It is our duty to remain at his sides , '@@ ' he said , to applau@@ se .
as a plac@@ atory gesture , the prime minister insisted his government would not call into question France '@@ s controversial 3@@ 5-@@ hour working week , despite infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory suggestions it should relax the rules earlier in the week by Em@@ manuel Mac@@ ron , the new economy minister .
on Satur@@ day , Mr Hollande had im@@ pl@@ ored his fellow Socialists to remain `` united '@@ ' with the government .
but Christi@@ ane Tau@@ bir@@ a , the justice minister , put a spann@@ er in the works by turning up to a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs and critici@@ sing the Socialist Party for letting the French `` lose faith in their future . '@@ '
marine Le Pen , the far-right National Front leader , he@@ ap@@ ed scor@@ n on the Socialists ' constant in-@@ fighting by saying she did not see the new V@@ alls government lasting more than just a few months .
Fran@@ co@@ is Hollande the Emperor has no clothes , but neither has Prince Manuel V@@ alls , forced to put together a new government when the previous one did n@@ '@@ t even survive the summer .
`` And the new one wo n@@ '@@ t survive the fall or the winter either , '@@ ' Miss Le Pen told supporters .
she reiter@@ ated her party '@@ s call for a parliamentary dissolution , saying she was confident it could win early elections and stood ready to govern .
France '@@ s ruling party suffered a dru@@ bbing in March municipal elections and the far-right National Front came out on top in EU elections in May .
a poll in Sunday '@@ s Journal du Dim@@ an@@ che found 76 per cent of French believe the Socialist Party risks breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Mr Hollande '@@ s presidential term in 201@@ 7 .
Pascal P@@ err@@ ine@@ au , a political scientist at Sciences P@@ o university , warned the French would fast lose patience unless the new Socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record unemployment .
`` It has a small window of opportunity , but public opinion needs to quickly feel things are changing , '@@ ' he warned .
otherwise , the situation could further de@@ generate .

Hong Kong pro-democracy activists h@@ eck@@ le China official day after vote ruling
a group of Beijing loyalists stood nearby wa@@ ving China '@@ s flag .
the NP@@ C Stand@@ ing Committee on Sunday endorsed a framework to let only two or three candidates run in Hong Kong '@@ s 201@@ 7 leadership vote .
all candidates must first obtain majority backing from a nomin@@ ating committee likely to be st@@ acked with Beijing loyalists .
the decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot prompted pro-democracy activists to renew their vo@@ w to bring Hong Kong '@@ s financial hub to a halt with `` Occupy Central '@@ ' protests .
political reform has been a major source of tension in Hong Kong , with China party leaders fearful of calls for democracy spreading to other cities .
following the publication by Beijing of a white paper out@@ lining China '@@ s authority over Hong Kong in June , democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on voting in the special administrative region , and hundreds of thousands marched to the city '@@ s business district and staged a si@@ t-@@ in .
Li '@@ s briefing is being organized by the Hong Kong government and China '@@ s Li@@ a@@ ison Office in Hong Kong .
the vice chairman of the Stand@@ ing Committee '@@ s Legislative Affairs Commission , Z@@ hang R@@ ong@@ sh@@ un , and the Deputy Director of the State Council '@@ s Hong Kong and Mac@@ au Affairs Office , F@@ eng W@@ ei , were also due to speak in a series of brie@@ fin@@ gs throughout the day .
student activists said they would gather outside of the Hong Kong chief executive '@@ s office in the after@@ no@@ on .
Britain made no mention of democracy for Hong Kong until the dying days of about 150 years of colonial rule .
Putin demands Kiev open ` statehood ' talks with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease battling separatists in the country '@@ s east and immediately begin negotiations on the breakaway region '@@ s `` statehood , '@@ ' according to Russian news accounts of his remarks .
his spokesman , Dmitry Pes@@ kov , later clari@@ fied that Putin did n@@ '@@ t mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia , but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian-@@ speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests .
but Putin '@@ s call upon the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-@@ Russia insurgents as equals cor@@ responded with the apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five months ago : help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed No@@ vor@@ o@@ ssi@@ ya region virtual independence to align with Russia instead of the West .
in an interview with state-run Ch@@ ann@@ el One television , Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to recover separ@@ ati@@ st-@@ held territory in the eastern Don@@ et@@ sk and Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k regions that were seized in March and April , after Moscow annex@@ ed Ukraine '@@ s Cri@@ mean peninsula on March 18 .
the Kremlin and the separatists have lately branded the seized territory `` No@@ vor@@ o@@ ssi@@ ya , '@@ ' or `` New Russia , '@@ ' a term that h@@ ark@@ ens to pre-@@ revolutionary glory days of the Russian empire .
Putin said that anyone who believed peace talks are in the off@@ ing as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns for an Oc@@ t. 26 parliamentary election and while government troops are attacking civilian communities in separ@@ ati@@ st-@@ held regions is `` a prisoner to illusions , '@@ ' I@@ tar@@ -@@ T@@ ass reported .
`` We must immediately commen@@ ce substantive talks and not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the statehood status of sou@@ theast Ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there , '@@ ' he said .
Pes@@ kov said Putin '@@ s reference to statehood was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership as it struggles to al@@ lay fears in the Russian-@@ speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger .
only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy , Pes@@ kov said .
it '@@ s not a matter to be negotiated between Ukraine and Russia , Pes@@ kov said , `` because it '@@ s not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal Ukrainian conflict . '@@ '
the Kremlin spokesman '@@ s inter@@ c@@ ession to correct the `` misin@@ terpre@@ tation '@@ ' of Putin '@@ s remarks underscored the Russian leadership '@@ s approach to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east differently from its outright sei@@ z@@ ure of Cri@@ mea , where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian .
Moscow would have a much more difficult fight to an@@ ne@@ x even the Don@@ et@@ sk and Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k regions of eastern Ukraine , as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian and pre-@@ conflict polls showed broad support for staying within Ukraine .
the autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would grant regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations , effectively handing the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian mainland with Cri@@ mea .
the Black Sea peninsula annex@@ ed five months ago is home to Russia '@@ s main naval fleet as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic coastal re@@ sorts .
the regions between Russia '@@ s Ro@@ sto@@ v area and Cri@@ mea are also home to mines , factories and found@@ ries that produce vital components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian President Pet@@ ro Por@@ o@@ shenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections -- weigh constitutional amendments to give more control to the disparate regions over their finances and the status of languages .
but his vision of autonomy appears to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels Moscow is accused of ar@@ ming and insti@@ gating .
Putin '@@ s latest call on Kiev to deal with the separatist leaders as equals followed new advances by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of A@@ zo@@ v .
the Russian-@@ backed separatists took control of the town of No@@ vo@@ az@@ ov@@ sk in a drive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the opening of a campaign to seize the strategic coastal territory all the way to Cri@@ mea .
that has spurred a massive civilian and military effort to for@@ tify Mari@@ u@@ pol , a ste@@ el@@ making port of 500,000 that lies between No@@ vo@@ az@@ ov@@ sk and the narrow gat@@ eway into the Cri@@ mean peninsula .
Por@@ o@@ shenko on Satur@@ day addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to urge action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
`` We are close to the point of no return , '@@ ' Por@@ o@@ shenko warned .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
the EU summit took no definitive action ; the leaders called for drafting more punishing sanctions on Russia to be imposed in the event of an un@@ specified escalation of the Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in I@@ lo@@ v@@ ay@@ sk after two colum@@ ns of Russian arm@@ or and 1,000 troops last week moved into the Don@@ et@@ sk region to bolster the bele@@ agu@@ ered separatists , Col@@ . An@@ dri@@ y Ly@@ sen@@ ko , spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council , told reporters in Kiev on Satur@@ day .
the first of a reported 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped in I@@ lo@@ v@@ ay@@ sk by the Russian incur@@ sion were sw@@ apped Sunday for 10 Russian par@@ atro@@ op@@ ers captured inside Ukrainian territory a week ago , Ly@@ sen@@ ko said Sunday .
nu@@ de photo scandal em@@ bro@@ ils Australian celebri@@ ties and G@@ abi Gre@@ ck@@ o
Ge@@ off@@ rey Edel@@ sten has v@@ ented his disgu@@ st at hack@@ ers who may have stolen nu@@ de images of fi@@ anc@@ ee G@@ abi Gre@@ ck@@ o and a who '@@ s who of Hollywood A@@ -@@ li@@ sters .
T@@ in@@ sel@@ town is re@@ eling after a series of explicit photos showing a nu@@ de J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence hit the internet in a major celebri@@ ty hack@@ ing scandal .
the hack@@ er responsible is said to have 60 nu@@ de photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and super@@ stars including models K@@ ate U@@ p@@ ton and Car@@ a Del@@ ev@@ ing@@ ne , sing@@ ers R@@ ih@@ anna , Ari@@ ana Gran@@ de and Le@@ a Michelle and actors Kir@@ sten D@@ unst .
Australian actors Ter@@ esa Pal@@ mer , Emi@@ ly bro@@ w@@ ning , Y@@ von@@ ne Stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski , and Melbour@@ ne@@ -based Gre@@ ck@@ o also had personal pictures allegedly re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed due to an i@@ C@@ loud leak .
there are 10@@ 1 celebri@@ ty names on the list .
Edel@@ sten , who proposed to Gre@@ ck@@ o last month , told confi@@ dential : `` It '@@ s disgu@@ sting . '@@ '
all private correspon@@ dence and images should remain private .
it '@@ s dis@@ gra@@ c@@ eful that personal information can be stolen and dispersed to others .
Gre@@ ck@@ o , who is in New York , reportedly told a news web@@ site the hack@@ ing was `` sham@@ eful '@@ ' and those targeted would `` feel violated . '@@ '
the hack@@ er is believed to have 30 images of Pal@@ mer with ex-@@ boy@@ friend Scot@@ t Spe@@ ed@@ man , including two fra@@ mes where she is lo@@ ung@@ ing top@@ less in a pool .
Pal@@ mer '@@ s film credits include Lo@@ ve And Hon@@ or , opposite Li@@ am Hem@@ s@@ worth .
Pal@@ mer , Ch@@ u@@ ck star Stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and su@@ cker Pun@@ ch ac@@ tress bro@@ w@@ ning yesterday had no comment on the hack@@ ed pictures .
a representative for Lawrence told T@@ M@@ Z : `` This is a fla@@ grant violation of privacy . '@@ '
actor Se@@ th Ro@@ gen las@@ hed out at the hack@@ er , t@@ we@@ eting : `` post@@ ing p@@ ics hack@@ ed from a cell phone is really no different than selling stolen merchan@@ di@@ se . '@@ '
just legally speaking , it should n@@ '@@ t be tolerated to report stolen p@@ ics .
cycli@@ sts , jo@@ ggers and wal@@ kers took part yesterday in the 8@@ th cy@@ cling E@@ vent on the Gro@@ sser Feld@@ berg mountain , giving their support to ` Hel@@ p for Chil@@ dren with Canc@@ er ' .
the Tour was a hard gr@@ ind for some , while others treated it as a light training session .
however , everyone agreed on one thing : it was a lot of fun .
Thomas Stu@@ dan@@ ski must have sle@@ pt well last night .
for the very first time in his life the head of the Ober@@ ur@@ sel Bre@@ wer@@ y took his bi@@ ke up the Feld@@ berg .
and for a good cause .
he can put up with a little muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , especially since his participation in the 8@@ th cy@@ cling E@@ vent on the Gro@@ sser Fel@@ berg was in aid of the ` Hel@@ p for children with cancer ' association , and gave him a valuable personal insight .
a great thing .
`` I now know that I can do it - brilliant ! '@@ '
you did n@@ '@@ t happen to have a little break to milk the applau@@ se ?
no , if I '@@ d stopped , I '@@ d never have been able to carry on ...
like Thomas Stu@@ dan@@ ski , a member for the CDU in the Ober@@ ur@@ sel town council , many of the 7@@ 18 participants struggled in the early mountain de@@ w , coming close to exhaus@@ tion , but arriving happily on top of the summit plat@@ e@@ au .
on the other hand , some others found it much easier to complete the full el@@ even kilom@@ et@@ re route between Hoh@@ em@@ ar@@ k and Feld@@ berg .
Norman Di@@ ess@@ ner , for example .
the Green politician , wearing all red , from the municipal council - red clothes , red bi@@ ke - looked to be taking it g@@ ently -LRB- `` quit some professionals here , so it '@@ s all about fini@@ shing ! '@@ ' -RRB- - and then looked almost like a pro himself as he arrived at the end 45 minutes later without p@@ aus@@ ing for breath .
he was another one who did it all in one go , as did N@@ ina Ku@@ h@@ n , press spokes@@ person for the Ober@@ ur@@ sel Council , who did the route along side Frank Grün@@ ei@@ sen .
for both the tri@@ athletes the `` Feld@@ berg cy@@ cling E@@ vent '@@ ' was not necessarily a spor@@ ting challenge : `` This one is about charity , and that '@@ s why we '@@ re gla@@ d to be here - we '@@ d have gone out riding anyway today , '@@ ' Ku@@ h@@ n said .
along the route they met up with Paul Wenz@@ el from Ober@@ rei@@ fen@@ berg .
the boy -LRB- 12 -RRB- had driven down to Ober@@ us@@ el in the morning , only to immediately go back up again .
Flori@@ an Zi@@ er@@ z from Frankfurt got himself into the sadd@@ le at 9 am ; he `` did '@@ ' the Feld@@ berg twice , before then whe@@ eling back home .
another one who enjoyed himself was `` F@@ rit@@ ten-@@ Ton@@ i . '@@ '
for the manager of the Ober@@ ur@@ sel cult ki@@ o@@ sk , taking part in cy@@ cling events which go over the Feld@@ berg is perfectly natural .
he took just 40 minutes to do the route with his 6.@@ 5-@@ kil@@ o ra@@ cing bi@@ ke .
a mad event .
for this cause I '@@ m very gla@@ d to be here , '@@ ' comm@@ ented Andre@@ as Bal@@ z@@ ke .
the well-@@ conditioned man from Main@@ z said he was an `` ambitious ra@@ cing cycli@@ st . '@@ '
and he must be , since he was riding a `` Fi@@ x@@ ie@@ -@@ Bi@@ ke '@@ ' which is a bi@@ ke without ge@@ ars ...
but it was n@@ '@@ t only cycli@@ sts who j@@ aun@@ ted to the top - as was eviden@@ ced not only by the 20 wal@@ kers , who climbed up via the White Wall and the Fu@@ ch@@ stanz , but also by a jo@@ gger who pulled behind him a Ty@@ re with wei@@ ghts attached to him by a ro@@ pe .
mountain Res@@ c@@ ue doctor , Professor Vol@@ ker Li@@ sch@@ ke , who was there with his team to provide safety , and who was equipped with a four-@@ wheel bul@@ ly and qu@@ ad , said : `` I know him from Frankfurt - he trains for a speci@@ alist s@@ lei@@ gh tra@@ il - it '@@ s just that he pul@@ ls the s@@ lei@@ gh himself . '@@ ' The man is , therefore , in a sense his own s@@ lei@@ gh dog .
the 7@@ 18 participants - which made them the greatest number ever - were sent off up the course in groups in the morning .
the wal@@ kers started at 9.@@ 30 am .
then it was the turn of the cycli@@ sts and run@@ ners , who began at 10 am .
five minutes later the first Mo@@ un@@ tain@@ -@@ bi@@ kers set off .
bent Hansen , Chairman of the Association ` cy@@ cling on the Gro@@ sser Feld@@ berg ' gave the starting orders and wished those taking part an enjo@@ y@@ able trip .
next year , he hopes to have safety barriers on the course for the benefit of those taking part on the Feld@@ berg .
