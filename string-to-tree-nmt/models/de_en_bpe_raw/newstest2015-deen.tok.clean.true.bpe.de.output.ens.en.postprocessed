Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The Congresses Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as citizens' rights.
"Just as labor unions die, the middle-class jobs die," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and vice-chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
For this reason, I am proud to present the employee's authorisation law in conjunction with the civil rights activist John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities of discrimination on the grounds of the organization of unions, such as other forms of discrimination - and stops such anti-union forces.
The amendment to the National Labour Law Act, in order to establish an opportunity for discrimination to be set up for the organisation of a trade union delegation, in order to have a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or penalties - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of her bill propose is the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks suffered by trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and in other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, extend and comply with labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans recall that this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of association in one breath.
When the United States took Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy, Hedki Tojos, was replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions play a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "the rights of workers in association and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pressed the Germans to write a constitution that would make fascism replaced by Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers should organise themselves, and to raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: 'The right to establish associations to ensure and improve working and economic conditions for each individual and every profession or business is guaranteed.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it are null and void; the targeted measures are unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, which was designed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors provided a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect their interests or to join them."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When that country, in other countries, explained how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union would then be able to take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government bodies - must be protected.
After these rights have come under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to recall the American ideal that the working population must have the right to unite and make itself heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry, raising the entire nation to unimaginable production levels.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History is a reminder, and that is what we should do.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past, triggering the promise of democracy.
Judges halting temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana may be forced to close down.
A US Federal magistrate, on Sunday, stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, the lawyer saying that it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the state.
This measure, which was introduced to the law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and should enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out abortions to acquire a patient approach to a hospital within a 30 mile radius of practice.
The decision of the judge, however, means that doctors can continue to carry out legally abortions while they are applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work according to the rule of law as they seek to obtain these rights," says Federal magistrate John degravelles in his judgment.
There will be a hearing for the judge within a month to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the most recent in a number of judgments against similar measures, and said that doctors had more time to obtain hospital entry rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana escape a malevolent law that wants to take their health and their rights to them," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, which had complaints in the name of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment was extended to the doctors of the two clinics, who did not join the complaint and have also asked for the right of introduction.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and courts recently declared such action in Alabama and Mississippi for non-constitutional.
Key areas of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the hospitals in the state to be closed down, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, are united in saying that the rights of doctors are demanding unnecessary restrictions.
Anti-abortion is contrary to the fact that measures are designed to protect women's health, although some of them also welcome the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a physician who performs in Louisiana abortions, has patient one-in-one, divided the centre for reproduction rights.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to do no more abortions, this doctor would no longer be able to carry out the operation because of fear of its security, said the group.
In their arguments against the verdict, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the conduct of abortions, while their claims on patients' rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best possible treatment leads to higher death rates for ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video album for her mother, who died in 2007 on ovarian cancer.
Women in rural areas of Australia have a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians in which ovarian cancer was identified in 2005 and found that only 25% five years after diagnosis were still alive.
The research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDY: New medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer.
Researchers studied medical care for women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-conditions as well as social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote areas of the state, mortality risk in the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not study why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspected a belated diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services, in order to counter the distances, it proposed as a possible remedy a strengthening of the service of one-headed doctors, to give specialists the opportunity to provide women more tightly to their homes, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, independently of geographical status, resulted in a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and highlighted the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013 Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast, received an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden Centers regret declining homeowners "losses
The decline, combined with an increase in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could lead to the loss of ten thousand pounds a year in garden centres if today's young consumers reach the "age group of garden products" after a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people spend on their own homes.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular procedure, pre-gardens to be paved for parking purposes, and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, valued at 5 billion £a year in sale.
In the metropolitan area of London, where the share of homeowners had fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products is reported per household.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society suggest that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that humans cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, CEO of RHS, said: "Container-gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when they move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail sector due to rising house owners and economic prosperity from the late 1980 "s to the mid-1990s.
It also projected an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather in the dark weather conditions in March and April of last year.
The protest movement, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Tibetan Tahirul Qadri, is continuing.
In the capital, Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators have lined up the state television channel PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from PTV buildings.
The transmitter placed its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now broadcast again.
At the same time, some 3000 demonstrators attempted to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around one kilometer away, they were covered with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police set up tear gas.
The demonstrators called for Sharifs to resign, but this is not the case.
The country's army, meanwhile, is calling for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and using force."
After a meeting on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The military has an important role to play in Pakistan, and has already spread it more frequently.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accused Prime Minister Sharif of having betrayed the parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests erupted at the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to enter Sharifs Residenz.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders a US diplomat for spy reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered the country's most senior US diplomat to visit a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the US Embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel, and the online magazine The Intercept, reported that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major activity area for the US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries spy on each other.
A previous report that also targeted Ankara's main secret service provided a much sharper response from the Turkish government.
Warning strikes: Driver leaders are speculating with consequences for commuters.
The nationwide warning strike of the driver's guide on Monday evening could also affect the movement of passengers in NRW.
The event, which was announced for 18 to 21 o'clock, is nationwide all transport companies, including long-distance, regional and rail transport.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

Chaired by the district chair of the German locomotive leader (GDL), Sven SchMitte, in Düsseldorf.
We are counting on considerable losses.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main cause of the warning strike is freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to foresee the consequences.
Police chief of Magaluf of Corruption
The prosecutor presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià on Friday at the office of the Public Prosecutor office.
The head of the Calvià police in Mallorca was arrested after corruption charges of businessmen and barowners in the notorious Binge-Drinking-Hotspot Magaluf.
Main Commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, was taken into custody in custody of several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf were found, was taken into custody after corruption charges against him.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià on Friday of the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other police officers were arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the corruption charges, and are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC reported that the angry night clubs said that cronyism of the authorities had serious implications for their business.
"It is no longer a matter of earning money, it is about survival," said one of the businessmen of the court.
Let our livelihoods come from the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video that showed a 18-year-old British tourist who performed 24 men during a Sauftour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcohol-based holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcoholic drinks.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatioan incident took place, was forced for a year to be closed, while Playhouse and the pub pentour organizer Carcrunch will have to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73.000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British tourists, is also known for a number of accidents involving alcohol consumption, including the trend of "balconing," in which people from a balcony to the other or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions impinge on flights from Adelaide Airport.
The FRÜHLING has a winter-like surprise, with strong swings and strong winds, which disrupted flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m., a further 5 mm rain fell to the city, after 6,6mm, which had already been down in the night on Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a row of short, stormy bushes, including a kiss that began shortly before 20 p.m., and in almost 4mm in about 10 minutes.
After last week's early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell to a peak of just 15.8 ° C. on Monday.
The worst weather conditions may have led to a delayed landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to be landing shortly after 7.30 p.m., however, was hit by a Scherwind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start.
At this time, the wind was about 50 km / h on the ground in Adelaide airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start a second landing flight and eventually set up at about 20.40.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including a Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C on Tuesday is forecast, with possible displays.
Matthies: Highest time on the big Vernet
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our cozy home into high-tech switching centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies comes with a highly trusted electronic accessory.
While I write here, my view of the spiral cable connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is one thought behind this: If the cable would not be, in a short time all the listeners will be flying around in the house, and that would be much more retro.
In any case, this applies to ekeltronic (ekeltronic)?
No, typing errors: Electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow is bought - outdated.
For example, if you have a tube-TV in the living room, for example, it simply says that he is opposed to television.
Why these considerations?
Because the urge of the Ifa at the radio tower this week brings us back to our absolute incompetence on issues of electronics.
The Laie, who had previously been blind to a washing machine and CD player, does not even today understand the purpose of the devices that are to be spread out with intangible expert spree before it: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises to us the press office.
Yes, do you still?
What are we to talk to with people who seem to be voluntarily expanding such Quark voluntarily?
In fact, for some 20 years, we have been talking about the fact that we are supposed to connect our House.
So that the yoghurt itself can be ordered, so that the fire alarm in the Maldives holiday on the Maldives will tell you that it burns in the working room.
And would it not be wonderful if we got from the office out of the air conditioning on our arrival soon...?
Yes, but this requires an air-conditioning system.
But a dream will definitely come true: We lift up our wristwatch, say "Saugen!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner gets away.
Misleading.
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods become blurred," raunt an industry moderator, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamers send the weather report and the data glasses indicates how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but that will not be useful because we stand in the traffic jam.
We also know from day-to-day practice: If a new-fashioned device is really badly needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza.
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after having spent the summer in air pollution, while rooting and moralising on their communities fell during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school start brought a feeling of joy and anticipation to the communities in the south of Israel in the south of Israel, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, a staff member of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a missile, was removed from the walls and shoals in front of the students "entry.
"We have a bit of fear, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in the Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that it feels a bit funny to go back to school again.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't come out of the House at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities, such as Saad, left their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and to escape from the fires and mortar fires.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education has said that some dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children have been accommodated in other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza, which is hard hit by the Palestinian attack.
He appealed to the children, much to learn and said "We will make sure that their knowledge acquires and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided for an immediate end to the fighting, but major problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for the Israeli-Egyptian blockade to be lifted and the air and sea ports to be reopened in Gaza.
Israel is calling for a disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed.
It is expected that a new round of indirect talks will begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and it estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but they did not provide any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortars while fighting at Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza zone, and around 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protected areas and the fighting continues, the educational authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be open again soon, so that we can continue learning, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After choice in Saxony: CDU-Vice Strobl puts NPD-prohibitive procedure into question
In the light of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl declared an end to the current NPD prohibition proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU-German Federal Movement, Thomas Strobl, the current prohibition proceedings against the NPD should be brought to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD performs worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU's head of state in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung."
This is a positive development in the right direction and a development that leads me to the result that the NPD is being fought in a political way, rather than before the Constitutional Court.
In the vote on Sunday, the NPD failed very close to the five-per cent limit.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party failed in 2003, because, at the time, the constitutional protection had been informant in the NPD.
The Federal Council received a new proposal in Karlsruhe in December 2013.
The federal government and the Bundestag did not join forces.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
At the latest, refugees are now being accommodated in tents.
The first reception for refugees in Harburg is bursting at all seams.
Now the office of the Interior has set aside three tents of the Red Cross.
The district leaders were first informed - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to foment public opinion and do not give regional politicians a chance to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, group leader of the Greens in the Harburg district assembly.
Your party claims that the district administration Harburg currently has unused homes for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for filling in the initial recording are the onslaught of help-seekers - and the fact that the authorities are unable to provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees stay longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homeowners in Australia's capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
Due to this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price rise was 10.9%, more than twice the rise in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The Research Director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne drive a divided market.
The numbers of RP data show that the house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year but at 11.7% in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where average prices rose by five and six per cent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government spending, and where prices rose by only 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lawless said that, for the next few months, with the beginning of the season, it would be possible to observe an increase in the sale of property that would be subjected to a real test for the market.
"If you look at the ongoing high rates of the auction price, a generally fast sales rate and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts statements by the CEO, Peer Medau, and attested to this "such as a field master."
This is not the style of the college, that is to say in the communication.
In the middle of June, the Medau family was informed verbally about the reception of the college.
The statement that the plans were only known in July are definitely wrong, "says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-emptive or even decisions," but there are "preferences."
The extension of the narrow road to the castle is less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
There was no mention of a nine-meter wide road and there was no mention of it.
The current situation is about 5.50 metres, which is a metre wider than it has been so far, "explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators, that their free and secondary parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future, Pötzl does not want to apply.
It will not be pardoned at all, because it can be solved intelligently as in other public parking spaces.
People living in the vicinity of the population
The children's doll, which is situated on the grounds and which, in front of the front door, would lead to the parking deck, should not be affected by the university president.
On the contrary, he notes that this is not just about the crèche, but also about the residents of the enunciation of the Friedrich-Streib street and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
We are talking about much more than the specific interests of Mr Medau, "says Pötzl.
Whether the critique of the child's prison, with the expansion of the street, "is entitled to" the few natural spots of Coburg, "is justified," can make the reader decide for himself. "
At the beginning of October Pötzl, together with the State Building Office Bamberg, wants to inform the municipal authorities about the development of the university by 2020 and in this respect the importance of the new development. "
Peer Medau informed the parents of the children's story last week about the plans of the college.
Thus, the access to the new parking deck does not lead to the campus and the Friedrich-Streib street, but to the Medau-Berg.
This means that the narrow road should be two-track, for about a kilometre of the length of the road.
According to the projections of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of the castle of Hohenfels would be ten times higher.
We are talking about 2000 vehicles every day.
There was no intention to comment on the project from the side of the city.
Glandorf takes place from the handball team of national team.
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the federal ligisten SG Flensburg-Handewitt has caused particular health problems for this decision.
The decision has not been easy for me, it has matured for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to finish my career in the national team, "the World Champion said in 2007 on his Facebook page.
It thus deals with a balance sheet of 167 Country Games and 576 goals for Germany in the international retirement age.
Because the fanciful backspace for the Champions League winner from Flensburg still wants to go to Torejagd for a few years, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestag, Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf has held a "long and good conversation with the Icelanders who announced their cadres for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have been as enthusiastic as they will inspire my long-time fellow players and my successors.
But for my club I also want to be healthy in the next few years, and longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which do not allow the current double burden.
The left-wing had to worry about his career after a feral infection in 2012.
Due to Achilles' s problems, he had to be treated by team doctors from the German Handballbundes (DHB) with a cornuclei, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then, Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of National Socialism do not pass judgement on a single body.
I have some health sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three doses of infection, which took place in a short time in 2012, I never managed to get my blood pressure properly under control.
To this end, there are some other types of wear-related complaints.
Even at the beginning of the year I realised that although I am controlling my head, I am not able to fool my body, "Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine" Handball Time. "
For a comeback he would be available only in absolute necessity.
"If all strokes tear, I am always ready to talk," explained the dual family father of the specialist magazine.
However, I can count on one hand for the years in which I can play handball.
I must also say that, after my long hospital stay in 2012, I became rather humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, I want to go at least to some extent.
In addition to the World Cup title in 2007 and the winner of the Champions League in 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and in 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also won the trophy of the Cup winner in Flensburg.
Germany's economy shrunk by 0.2% in the spring.
The crises around the world have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
From April until the end of June 2014, gross domestic product fell by 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
The Federal Statistical Office informed the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed that preliminary calculations have been made.
Consumption revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slows down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual programme, a GDP increase of 0.8% in comparison with the second half of 2013 is set for the first half of the year.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste," which was first introduced by Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzfer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterland-Mooiste."
This is the largest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
For more than 1000 participants, with their registration at Jos, they took part in organising this tour through the Münsterland.
These tours have been offered in various journals in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and are driven overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland again in this way. "The cyclists are happy about the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration in the club of the protégé Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city via the Wall, where the start took place.
Further the route, which was advertised for three different categories, led to Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 km with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 km with 1775 metres of altitude, the cyclists prove their good condition.
They were cared for in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer, Jos, and mayor of Heinz Lölfing, was very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all concerned.
The organisation was carried out without any problems and there were no negative incidents, "Heinz Lölfing initiated a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not so many participants, as the organizer had hoped, probably due to bad weather forecasts and to the morning rain.
"In 2015 we will again see beautiful weather on the 30th of August or during another weekend, but unfortunately the cyclists return to the Münsterland again and the organisers are planning a new edition.
A man's wake-up call to innocent memoirs.
It is actually more philosophical testimony as a biography, which has brought Konstantin Wecker, song maker, pacifist, and political activist, ex-prisoner, in "monk and Warriors" on 287 pages.
It is not chronologically, but rather more ideas. It was written in Munich on June 1, 1947, that his memoirs were written in Munich, each chapter by an appropriate song text.
And he is ruthless in all honesty: From Onanie as a high school of high-grade school to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave any human weakness.
Also to show how he has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also take on abstract, but all the more important concepts of a: Love, soul, ego, the being in now, spirituality - all this tries to go to the bottom, on very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifist, his social critique, his political commitment - and also how he played not only the music (the opera-lover became the soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker to the asketic monk, who is "by subtraction," as he says, "by making everything impossible."
Among all the highly spiritual views, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: About beatings in a pub frequented by GIs, or a crazy car trip where he first set up a tree.
Here, too, it is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me to the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was, worked in a factory and her ratio was limited.
Henry worked for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and came from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was difficult to know him.
One never saw his face, heard only his voice: "Listen to the collar.
Leave your sister in peace.
Take you away!
I want to see cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown when I was a child - went to the pub and talked about things like the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life was this serious type in the corner, which read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than at the time of his father, he won a glimpse of how life had been for him.
It is slightly brighter now, but they are dark, rough, deep-green labyrinthe with flame attacks, smoke and much soot.
In the past, my father simply sat in the bath and then he was able to listen to him as he started singing because he could wash the foundry of himself.
When I was there, I realized that he had been doing so for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him was greater.
Nevertheless, Henry was born as a child without the love deeds of his parents.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went badly at the end of her life, we began, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Would you like to stop "I love you?
Stop me to hug me!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still French friends with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys's own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to their deaths.
So when I was very, very overweight and symptoms of diabetes showed, said my doctor "you must be radical.
So I pulled out of this fitness and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henrys career change may be apparent in his elegant, short-cut Bart.
Ever since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he was captured by the theatre.
It followed the comedy of the bugs, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and comedies who have completed their busy working life.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated and wrote in New Faces.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitation / comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned at work.
I had to learn not only from the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I was able to become an efficient wike-telling machine, while I was a star by television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 on New Faces
Since his manager had the stage rights of the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment programme, in which people "black anmally," took his comedy over five years.
My family was very unpleasant to do so.
I wish that it had never happened, but I do not regret that I did.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to handle a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning British television pillar" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
With the introduction of figures, which were the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedykreis in the 1980s.
The first series of the lenny Henry Show went back in 1984, and in the 1990's he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie boss!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film rolls were embossed in the next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008 he thought: "What are you going to do next, because it all feels like the time or place a little on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was really allergic.
I had never learnt anything about him at school and stopped him mainly for a domain of middle class, white in tights and a cabbage head in front.
So I was afraid of it.
All that we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Do not make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare.
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos's last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my mind on the head at last.
"This is what it is, it is a serious matter, take it seriously, bring your text, journalists a bit.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that simply did not happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of delusions.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed you."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me" You need to bridge 10 minutes while you repair your computer. "
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank goodness."
I am not responsible for that.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You play in a play, that is, stay in your role."
Henry in Fences on Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That, too, was a good thing, so it is like a big sign of the gods that tell me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a greeting voice.
So I stand by it.
I really love that.
I love to be in a sample room.
However, Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is surrounded by humorous eruptions, while he repeatedly imitates people.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy, because I think that this type of instant gratification of a room full of stranger is somehow dangerous.
If you are looking for it, you are driving a wall.
I sometimes speak live in the Apollo, if I like, but overall I don't get as much as before.
I ask him whether he will ever make a stand up Comedytour.
The fun that I have in a space with a director who helps to make a start, a middle part and the end of a trip - I do not think I want to give up.
So here is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I love to play an actor.
It is fun.
They always tell a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels are blocking roads in Yemen's capital.
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis was called into civil disobedience in the capital, Sanaa.
On Monday, Marthi supporters had to occupy the main streets of Sanaa, a spokesman of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah."
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi was called upon to take action on Sunday evening.
Huthi, threatened with a further escalation of the conflict, threatened that its demands should not be met.
Shiite Huthis is fighting for more independence from Sunni-controlled Yemen, and demand the government's resignation.
The People's League of Nations has been besieging the Yemeni capital for just two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the great access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there is always a bloody conflict with the Yemeni Army.
Kenya registers official officials to contain "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials to delete "ghost workers" from the government's pay lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay, was a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people are still receiving payouts after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the civil service when he took office in 2013.
At a check at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month was lost in payments for "ghost workers" and by other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be paid out to accounts, after a person died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports on the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear in the next two weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their data will be included on biometric registrations has been communicated in a government message.
Everyone who did not do this without a credible apology would be removed from the pay list, the communication was continuing.
"This process has made a significant contribution to the rationalization of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also clearing the pay list at both levels of government - so the" ghost employees "are being eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of decentralisation and planning.
The scandal surrounding the art adviser Helge Achenbach is being negotiated for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi-founder Theo Albrecht, claim in a civil process at Düsseldorf's Regional Court 19.4 million in damages of Achenbach and two of his companies that are in insolvency proceedings.
The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and comfortable.
In the Kault clause it says that Achenbach was cheated by the purchase of works of art and Oldtimers, and Berthold Albrecht charged higher than actually paid purchase prices.
This would mean that the agreed commission would have been higher.
Achenbach purchased an inventory of €121 million for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
44 years he was in school service, 23 of them as head of school.
From that time, Manfred Richter knows many of Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as pupils.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worn by his desire to see people in the student.
The snowekoppe is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif of his homeland.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau / North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was interested in the secondary school for the teacher's profession after four years of secondary education.
One year after that the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their homes.
After a few months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
As a result, judges were stranded in the upper-middle of the valley.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
For this purpose, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers to the next station six times a week, with the train going to Bamberg, three kilometres across the whole city and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping experience in a Red Cross Home in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 students in a dormitory room.
In 1951 he made the first, and 1954 after three years of teaching staff, the second State examen.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free training place for him, he went to Upper Bavaria and arrived at the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fräulein-Room" was his first "apartment" in the school building.
In 1958 he referred to a three-room-apartment in his new schoolhouse next to the school.
This House bought Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and in Petershausen five.
From the end of the school year 1968 / 69, these were brought together in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only primary school was in place.
In order to avoid a reclassification of the smaller school, the former rector, Georg Sigl, moved to Karlovy Vary, and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers, from September 1982, were able to relate to today's construction, which was extended to judge retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, in addition to municipal costs, built a workshop room and in the extension of 1997 basement rooms, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very schoolfriendly," reminded judges grateful.
In his whole career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of one of the leaders who responded to a Ministry of Justice and Justice Department saying "You must never forget the love," Manfred Richter put down what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: Roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to know: "This is not always possible," whether he or she is only his disciples, or his own six children, is not quite clear.
In any case, Judge actions were sometimes unconventional.
If pupils were to be tested, they did not receive a punitive job and were not left to sit back.
At the expense of the village, Richter had put two pair of boxing gloves and left the two opposing parties against each other, even if there was to be a ballast there.
For the benefit of the school, the judge was a good relationship with the then mayor, Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the party-less judge after his retirement in order to run in 1996 at least as the last one on the CSU list for the municipal council.
Yet judges were elected to sit six and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
Hr4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists set off at the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scots stopovers.
If Radler do on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of Rastering impression was made: The 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour, accompanied by the accompanying tross, enjoyed a pause at the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
A concert of Van Baker & Band took place on Thursday in Bad Vilbel on Thursday, under the motto "Radeln and celebrate the new paths between Nida and Kinzig."
On Friday, it was taken seriously: The cyclist took the first stage, which took 60 kilometres from Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and continued into Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of the mayor Hans-Peter Alameda, who was co-initiated in Bad Vilbel, were greeted by the manager of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
Many things were prepared for the refreshment of body and spirit: The rural women of Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, kennel, spear and cheese cake.
"Such cakes can only bake country women," praised an entrant to Aulendiebach, while another piece of cake was found.
Cold refreshments were available for cold refreshments at the drink booth of Geiß-Nida.
The "duo Bravo" kept the visitors with well-known tunes from operettas and musicals, and greeted enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
He also enjoyed a head massage of his partner: "He deserves, after all, he has recovered already stretched-out bicycle chains."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: They were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking desk of reporters Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Since the first hr4 cycle tour in 2004 as a tour manager, also, PhD Manager Tobias Hagen, was able to carry out only briefly snowing, but he had to do a lot with the technology on the spot.
His pick-up truck, in which he communicated with three phones and a radio unit with his staff and the 15-man motorcycle squadron of the police of Hesse, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have travelled.
The number of participants depends on the accommodation capacity available.
In Category I the participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in NPM.
In the health resort the cyclist had a good impression when it resumed after one and a half hours: "Tschüss!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" They waved farewell.
After arriving in Scots, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclist in the idyllic Alteburgpark was called for.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had a beautiful festive atmosphere and of course had been prepared for treats, such as the use of cold-baked bread with well-cooled spring white.
Mayor of Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director of Markus Hoßfeld and MSC-Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as director of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
In spite of the sporting activity on the bicycle, the opportunity for swimming in the open air was taken out on the bike.
Among the guests there were increasingly citizens, who were just as enthusiastic about the good mood as the big shakers of cyclists.
On the second day for the cyclists, the stations of Birstein, Guardiansbach and Bad Orb, including a concert with the separator, were on the programme.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on grounds of suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," reporting local media agencies.
The police authorities did not give a direct comment.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level police officers, interviews are in protest, daily news.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly founded an organized criminal group and had called telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities cited by the Islamist clerical pursuit of manure against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all the children in Ukraine are returning to school.
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told journalists that not all schools had opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian grass-roots front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukwie, school director of the school in Slavjansk, who visited Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace and that the children will be given a form of education that will be useful to them in further life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC might have found the great director it needs.
She meets with a proud glory in the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has own front-hand experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., which she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of Pearsons.
She had been CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned as the top post of the parent company Pearson to a younger male colleague.
Its detection was supposed to be nearly $1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
It was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: She became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Even in May, I described the role of Chairman with a poisoned kelch.
Not only is the BBC seen as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence in two directions is in two directions: The first guard in the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also externally as a voice of public concern and concern when things go wrong.
This makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires a full-scale reform.
But what new president would risk to run on everything and to divide an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may be able to do his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, there are still many interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money, and status.
While the competition is approaching and new technologies threaten to threaten old, convenient collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of EUR 145.50 £a year, the British public buys into the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: It says that it reaches 96% of households, and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And it seems that the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale, with 53% supporting them today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I now receive news messages on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and significant institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she has found it.
Musharraf from Texas says that cut-off tweet was not authorised
A tweet of the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday included a derogatory remark about the democratic district prosecutor, who is at the centre of a criminal prosecution against him because of abuse of authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perrys's user account, which broke the previous one.
A Tweet has been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I cheap the Tweet and have deleted it," said it in the subsequent message.
Staff from Perry did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although the tweets were issued by Perrys's official user account, it wasn't clear who actually served the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavourable image of the District Prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned in April 2013 for drunkenness on the tax.
Musharraf put a veto against financial support for her office, when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment of Perry - who could possibly be the presidential candidate in 2016 - before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The text of the Tweets is: "I am not always drunk with the three-fold permitted alcohol level... but when I do it, I set Governor Perry when he sweeps it."
I am the most fervent of democracy in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the study of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a Special Public Prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Musharraf did not plead guilty and called the charge a political ploy.
His high-class team of legal counsel applied the case with the guilty judge to dismiss the indictment and argued that the law, which took place against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas, is infested.
Musharraf stopped the government's Public Integrity Unit of the state's Public Integrity Unit - located in Travis County - and in cases of government corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public appeal by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perrys's official account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After having completed the presidential election in Iowa during his presidential candidacy in 2012 as a fifth, Perry went to speculation that he would stop by joining a tweet of a photograph of joking near a lake in the vicinity of a lake, in the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains housing market back to "normal" again.
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England was "returned" to normal levels.
Home homes in the capital were very much sought and the subject of huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England, owing to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, to set limits on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013," added that it offers a "stable operational environment."
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the land registry, prices in urban areas increased by 18.5% over the past year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
The average selling prices in Haiti's private, low-cost, and student offers rose by about one-fifth last year and at the end of April at the 423,000 £.
But a heavier pound has, in recent months, made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "villa tax" before the general election next May.
Last week, London's real estate agents Foxton warned that, in the second half of the year, in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report in April would lead to lower market growth in both real estate and prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday showed a decline in mortgage lending in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected his predictions for the rise in house prices in London for 2015 down to 3%, on the basis of an already weakened house-price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas in London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter of a quarter, according to the brokers WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due for appointment sales amount to more than €2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added, "the demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations has remained stable and, as a result, the derivatives have remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost one-third more than the peak of 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40 percent annually to €280 million, sales by 18 percent to €1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday, before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that, in the current year, the revenues for Berkeley would be expected to meet current market expectations.
Analysts agreed the annual pre-tax earnings to €450 million.
Berkeley shares were held in London in the afternoon at 23.96.
Naked pics of Jennifer Lawrence by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscarhire.
Naked pics of Jennifer Lawrence were released online by a hacker who claimed to have a "Master's List" of images of more than 100 Starlets.
A representative of the stars of "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker for "blatant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who re-post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were supposed to be produced by a gap in the online memory system icloud from Apple, the alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported Buzzfeed.
It is not sure how many of the images are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who have taken photographs of photographs taken by my husband and I recently in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so happy with you," Wenger wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "devout, however, caused that the photographs were images of her and tweetete" These so-called nude pictures of me are fake, people.
Let's take a look at the beginning.
Buzzfeed reported at the late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop star Ariana Grande broke the authenticity of the supposed photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly praised novel about love and the letter "J."
They turned out, the best way to describe them was that they slowly came down to like a cardboard that was put out in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, dissociated and perhaps a bit scratch-resistant.
And then shake hands with him.
Scratzser knew he was.
It was disgusting, as in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this muddle was a just beginning affair, which was more promising to relieve the lonely boredom of his life, and perhaps even brought it to a certain degree of satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling beauty with unstitched hair and a flattering heart from a village on the north island, which was even more remote and rough than port Reuben.
It was with an older accompaniment to the south, who held Kevern for her aunt, and who inherited a plot in a wet but paradise valley with the proper name Paradise Valley.
For several years nobody had lived in the house.
The pipes were leck, in the baths were still spiders, naked drummers had left their traces on all windows and believed that they belong to them all, and the garden was watched with weeds, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house of a children's tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" on the Longlist is for the man booker price 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had a hand with Ailinn hanging on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, both of which had remained in the service console, which caused the land with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, which his father had a long forgotten blacksmith in the house, with closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was so right banned - simply not played.
It has been successfully rendered obsolete, as the word obsolete.
The general taste of what leaves and rules could never have been achieved, and how the people in books choose the dishes of the men who have been taken over from the table, for the a millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love romans, they chose the ballads for the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern started playing an imaginary piano and engaged in a coarse-comical Serenade Ailran great feet.
Ailinn did not understand that.
"This was a famous song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he told her and put two fingers on his lips.
He had always done his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting your lips on your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was not a very fun game already at that time, and it was not really fun now.
He knew that he was expected to do so, and that was all.
It had to explain what was Jazz.
Ailinn had never heard of it.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly banned.
It was no longer possible to improvise.
It was just space for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be completely safe at the beginning of a melody where they would end up.
So is the mind.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically worn-out wisdom.
Although he was ten years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the half-secret collection of his father's old CDs.
But at least he had to not explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
In her age she could probably not remember a time in which pop singers were not black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compliant company meant that every element of this society appreciated the principle of group talented - grateful to the fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for fun and sport due to temperament and body construction, in other words, they sang and burned them.
People originally derived from the Indian sub-continent were blessed by nature with electronic talent, and were responsible for ensuring that no family remained in service without working staff.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the seduction; what was left of the Greeks had torn plates.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, as the WHAT-WAR, WHY WAR, WHY WAR, because of fear that the flames would eat them next, because of fear that the flames would eat them next, they thought and were depressed by the lack of inaction.
Everyone, according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it hard to understand how the insulting words that Kishn had just sung could ever become.
Music was an expression of love.
"These are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Perhaps for people whose feet are too large.
My father never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing was able to overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon sheets.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father have liked something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated in her present to put two fingers on the lips.
She already thought that he was a little strange.
"It appeared to him funny," he said instead.
They shook their heads and blocked Keaves's view.
There was nothing to see in the whole world than their unshakeable rabid hair.
There was nothing he would have wanted to see.
"If you say it," I mean them without conviction.
But that does not explain why you accuse me of it.
It seemed to be an honest concern.
Are my feet too big?
Once again, he looked at it.
Your feet so directly not.
Perhaps your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me, because my ankles are too thick?
You hate?
Of course I hate you not.
That is just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you are getting away with me," he tried instead.
I am a bit perturbed.
That was not the right thing to do.
It had to be comical.
When he tried to be comical, he often got into trouble because he, like his father, did not have the calming charm that was needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, that would be.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from her deck-chair, threw the console around and poured the wine that she had drunk.
Wine-growing wine, so drunkenness was not an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I feel" walking "to you," she said...
Except that I am not at all.
She was sorry, because of the unnecessary disquiet of his words, as well as the fear that appeared in her eyes when she turned out against him.
Did she know that he would beat them?
She had not told him of life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke out here as it was on the shore.
The same confusing men, with even thicker skin and more elaborate after the WHEN WAR, who were their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always willing to raise the hand against a woman who refused or desiring them.
Milking?
They would have shown a thick fist if they didn't fit!
It was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter-poison to unsuspecting love ballads from the console - and then beat them.
According to Keared's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the knee was an act of violence itself.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through her body.
It arose from the deck chair like an old man.
She felt as well as he was, but the force of his sadness surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew.
He looked at him as he turned away - just as it was by a room on the upper floor her companion he saw him - a man, complaining by something he had raised himself.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some of her hands had fallen against them.
A man turned away from her back, ashamed, beaten, beaten, without fighting spirit - why was it a sight that she seemed to know well, had she not been able to remember a single time that she had ever seen before this day?
When she was back alone, Ailinn's Solomons looked their feet.
Many years in front of the events that have just been mentioned, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for public sentiment, gave a short lecture on the continued violence at low and intermediate levels in precisely the parts of the country, in which their reduction, if not abolition, were most likely to be expected, given the funds and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence, in view of the funds and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has already been done a lot, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the congenital aggressiveness of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of it, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been sensed historically, despite the high-rise cherry juice between the hedges.
But some characteristics turn out to be indestructible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion he continues to raise.
The population is crying out for listening to sentimental ballads, surrounded by stories of over-exploited difficulties, and claims to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless, not only does the legacy of family-run marriages and family life look like, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and backward-looking struggle at home, in the workplace, on the streets, and even on the playing fields.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest that you read fewer novels.
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask: Are you atheist?
"I do not think that I have to say," I said ESME Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
ESME again instilled its right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminists?
Again silence.
"I do not ask this," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, reading or feminism.
This is a non-discriminatory workplace.
We serve a non-discriminatory society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are entirely acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort the results you have presented.
You yourself have obvious prejudice against the Church, and these things that you call the "underhand" and "roh" may well be interpreted as an expression of strength and vitality as well as an expression of a sense of strength and vitality.
If you continue to go on, WHEN IS WHAT WHY IS WHAT WHY IS WHAT WHY IS WHAT WHY WHEN, as if, if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the land of its essential vitality.
ESME Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head repeated an LED label in Flamingorosa the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile your neighbor, value your partner, listen to ballads, visit Musicals, use your phone, use your phone, talk to you, say you, listen, listen to, excuse yourself.
Speaking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you are saying," says ESME Nussbaum with a calm voice when she was sure that her predecessor had come to an end, "and I say nothing other than that we have not yet been treated as effectively as we ourselves are deluding ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in the same way as we repeat the mistakes that were made at the time of the WHEN IS WHAT, IF IS IT.
This time, however, it is not the other who let us lose our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with hands.
In order to indicate an eye patient d.
"You go too far," he said, "if you describe acts as" mistakes "that our grandparents might or did not commit.
They also go too far when you say that they have left their "anger" and "distrust" of "other."
It should not actually be necessary to remind anyone in your position that we do not speak of 'us' and 'other' in understanding the past as in the protection of the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "other."
It was a period of disorder, that is everything we know.
"From what, if we are honest with ourselves," said ESME "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I do not blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or well done, what has happened is done.
That was then.
There is no need to say anything more about this - we agree on that.
And, just like no fault, no fault must be paid if such a tilting is appropriate and if there is a way to eradicate it.
But for what purpose is the past, if we do not learn from it -
The past has served us to forget them.
If I may say something, I should like to say something about this.
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will take care of her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overridden by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, walked on the footpath in a kind of "brutal anger."
The situation is there.
Lesotho-military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho opposed a coup to overthrow the government, saying that they were against policemen accused of arming the political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and informed that the army of the country occupied his office of residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The Premier brought his family to the adjacent South Africa after he had reported attacks on attacks.
Military spokesman Major Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup d'état, but that the military responded to the threat of "political fanatic" whose arming was elevated by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the Defense Forces of Lesotho, after having received several secret service reports, had been able to operate within the police some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc," he said to Voice of America.
The Prime Minister of South Africa, Clayson Monyela, said that military action had the impression of a revolution.
"Even though no one has claimed that the government has hijacked the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho are currently showing signs of a coup," he said.
According to the military in Lesotho, on Sunday, the soldiers went back to their barracks, and the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, the vice-president Mothetjoya Metsing takes over governance during Thabanes's absence.
Thabane announced that he believes he has been targeted because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been great tension since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the clashes in its unity government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, despite the displeasure of the charges.
Production in the euro zone on a 13-month low.
The increase in production in the euro zone slowed to the lowest point of the last 13 months in August, a closely watched study.
The final Markit purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after 51.8 in July.
An indication of over 50 gives an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced eruptions at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures meet before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with the eurozone's hesitant recovery, and for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the ECB Head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could give further details in the course of this week whether it will consider quantitative easing in the eurozone, in line with those that the UK and the US made during the financial crisis.
"Although a little growth is better than no growth, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers have become more evident," said Rob Dobson, chief economist in Markit.
The PMI factory for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic nation of Block, France, the PMI has fallen to 46.9.
France remains a sorgenual, as is Italy's departure from a solid expansion of stagnation.
Indications that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism of Germany, and in Spain and the Netherlands no longer take effect, are also not reassuring, "said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the efforts of analysts who expect more monetary or fiscal stimulus.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
At IHS Global Insight, Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing-management index of the manufacturing industry in the euro zone in August is that after that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "In the eurozone," producers in the euro zone are now obviously quite difficult, as the current increased geopolitical tensions, particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine, increase uncertainty in the continued difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased uncertainty has clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably means that some missions are being delayed or even cancelled, in particular large orders.
He said that it would be "ever more likely" that the ECB eventually had to launch a kind of QE, "although we suppose that this will be limited."
The nightmare of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children exposed to it are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Europe.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day martyr that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who missed death in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, including 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
As fanatical Islamist terrorists captured children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy of the West and East in horror, and then suddenly turned into action and hope for the future in the worst of misery.
Ten years later, we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who missed death in the classroom.
We have found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will continue forever.
Their greatest hope?
The war that Ukraine is now looking for - and in which children are dying - is now coming to an end.
The girl, who was photographed in the attempt to climb into the battered school sporthalle,
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Tuakov and became famous when she only tried to climb into the battered school sporthalle after a mine exploded.
Aida went on to search for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were deemed dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me I was going to run for my life but I could not say," Aida said.
My legs were ostracized.
I stood up and climbed again to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a number of operations she found herself completely cured, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I am afraid I have to be dealt with again.
Some grenades are still in my knees.
Their aim is to become a dentist in order to help people who have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says.
"That is what happened to me, and that cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who have stayed there.
My friends and I do not try to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, although the memory of each year is somewhat weak.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horror and we are grateful for the help we have received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see online the photo of me, how to get back to school, I think that many people will see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help to ensure that this sort of thing does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball-neck, in the opinion that his mother was dead, his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (Russians went to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said: "Mum has told me that I should sit down when there is an explosion, and keep her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: "Run."
Full of fear that it could be dead, he fled and saw a crying infant, seized the hand and fled through a ball-neck.
His father, Vladimir, who closed his son out there, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said: "I could not save them."
In reality, Tamara was stretched out outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, for its part in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I wept for joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now unsolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows every day, but I wish I could stop with remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will be bliss in my memory.
I still know that immediately I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and this is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back into the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children with whom I played in the court, and who did not leave it outside.
We never say that they were killed or dead.
We say they remained in the sports hall.
I remember very well on my trip to London, especially to the toy shop, where I was able to choose what I wanted, and the journey in an open car.
But now he is afraid of place as Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me of it.
"I am so sorry for all those who are suffering from horror," said Damir, who worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I would like to help.
I want to go to the police for one day and hope that they will take me to the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and run, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers her journey to London with Damir.
The people of London mocked when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her Foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and her simply say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borchsch and call it all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share and support our pain.
She said: "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war now continues, and every day people die and I believe that many children have been killed and still being killed.
These are just such children as ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or occupied with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I cannot stop feeling that feeling.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know he does not like this, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go into the sports hall and ignite candles.
When he was smaller, he suffered - I remember, as he was sometimes put on the sofa, the face of us stopped for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember once again how he continued all his weapons and other military toys, now 17, larger than I, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around, and saw the hell around me around, with all the body parts lying around me.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy was able to survive in this hell.
"I remember that I stopped him," Damir, running, run away, "but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he has gone away.
And so lives, unlike many others, for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of Beslan's abomination
Comfort: The Beslan survivors Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, on the right, a picture of Georgij today
His bloodstream was driven by fear when he burned his life, while Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had removed him for his first day of school before leaving her to bring her older son, Vladimir, to the university.
"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date becomes, the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day in which we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it was long ago, I think it was done yesterday, some scenes from these days follow me forever.
Nobody will forget that, I promise you.
Well, the picture of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgians wanted to go to school this day, saying that he wanted to convert his teacher.
I knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden in our house on the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also believe that, thanks to this image, people throughout the world feel our pain.
Georgij today says, "It is important that this sort of thing never happened again.
"I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People are investigating such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they are investigating the fall of these Boeing in Ukraine.
Are we ever going to know what caused it?
This world is becoming something of a horror.
"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so what happens?
Ten years has nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
I went back to school in 2004 and was afraid of every day.
I thought to my friends and classmates who were killed.
That is why I always go to the sports hall, when 1 September approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It is difficult for me to go into the sports hall, but I must do it.
I do not feel as a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not hide myself.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visit a medical university in Vladikawkaz.
I am going to become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgiy Faniev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorists.
A miracle: Georgiy Faniev was trapped during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorists, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and was sitting next to the bomb that was fixed at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is really a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel as if it were yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to be a secret agent for the FSB, but who could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, there is nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with terrible experiences - I must say that this is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and after that I felt a little better, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - in the year after that - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost the consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Live: Georgij Faniev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I am wearing it every day with me.
My friends know that I do not like this or talk about it, and they never asked me about the school.
For me, physically speaking, it is a good thing.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can now do well.
But because of my health, I could not study the World Intelligence Agency in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have sent my documents, including medical reports, and they have replied that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said: "I knew that I would never share my experience with my children.
Children should not know nothing about them, and they should not, of course, be exposed to them.
His mother Marina, 42 said: "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse, when the anniversary brings us closer.
I will be commemorating the celebrations.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It must be much more violent for him, because he was there and I did not.
I waited at home on him and could not help.
I am grateful to God that he was returned to me.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.
It is difficult to accept that, if something so unfair occurs.
He is a boy, he likes sport, but he cannot take part because of his knees.
He has been operated on a number of occasions, but he can walk, but he cannot do sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50%, but we can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, and this was exacerbated only by my pain.
I lost many people, whom I knew well and which were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is crying for the ghettos.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It is hard to accept that life will continue, even if you do not want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
We were once a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are being killed.
If only all these rebels can seize and throw out, we can go as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, who was really driven into safety by a special intervention squad.
Save: Aljona Tskajewa is brought to security by a Russian special-purpose squad (left).
It is now ten (right) and is not at all reminiscent of the cruelties.
The world held its breath in 2004, when the baby Aljona was persecuted in the arms of a Russian police from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists left them, but in their cruelty they kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has been married since then and with his new wife Swetlana, he has a little girl that he named Kristina after his lost daughter.

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you'd like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most cost-effective option is a waterproof point-and-Shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which have to be $300.
I have included these photos in a family lock with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are sealed close.
Place your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders feature the scene and recording mode that optimizes the exposure time for low-risk underwater conditions.
And before you jump out, test the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple photos - because many do not fold.
Point-and-Shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, Action-Cams typically do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right adjustment is a good thing.
So make many shots.
If your camera has a serial mode with which a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings are made, take advantage of it.
Remain close to the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, the farther you remove from the surface.
So, if possible, you can stay close to the surface if you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Take a close look at the objects.
This is also a good Council country, but it is all the more important because of the poor light conditions under water.
It is especially important if you work with an action-cam: These devices often have a solid white tip, which means that you have to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire picture boxes.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed, even in such a gigantic organization like the NHS.
As a consultant for anaesthesia, he dedicated his job to sparing the sick as well as the agony of the disease as well as the vagaries of treatment.
His wife, he remembers, was a MI6 worker who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors were important to diagnoses and illnesses, while the treatment was mostly done with something very different: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the person who began the act of suffering.
"I didn't feel like this," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulties trying to clean me up.
While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatient for his wife Juliet.
"I want everything better than later," he did.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson was extremely unhappy and worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his breast.
Just two weeks ago, he had been to ski in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray inspection were available.
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, in other words, that the lungs attack the skin.
As with most cancers, the exact catalyst is often difficult to determine.
For example, some smokers have contracted lung cancer, not all lung cancer infected have been smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is the result of exposure to asbestos - contact with the fibre-building material, which was once known as a "miracle" which has now been seen as lethal.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960 "s, when industry voluntarily committed itself to no longer use it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the substance - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard, from a different point of view, it seems to be a little more worrying today.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is today the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths from Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.
Annual figures for Mesothelidisis cases since 1980, and estimated future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (1999, all types of asbestos were banned), is that a mesotheliom is not developed after decades.
And the Scourge of the Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and still is, in the homes in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools where we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And, therefore, Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
The buildings of Parliament are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy, it has already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor was he a plumber.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have been in contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks as if in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed six years of my training, a lot of asbestos was present," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and peacekeepers - use the tunnel.
One wonders how many of my young people will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been suffering from mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last who still lives."
How many of us will become ill?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with Mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all centrifugal sufferers are dying within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always terminates.
So we can only repeat the question of Lawson's question: 'How many of us will become ill?'
The UK's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that, between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic is likely to come to a halt in the UK, there will be a total of 90,000 in the disease.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the victims frequently turn to claims for compensation, shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, gave, for example, Janice Allen mistakenly exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship stores in Oxford Street.
Ms. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her career at M & S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this issue," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't know anything about asbestos yet.
I never thought that this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance but a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asvyform," a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, known as white asbestos, is today by far the most frequently found asbestos in buildings.
It has been used for roof panels, floorboards, pipe insulation, floor insulation, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other types of asbestos, but it is still seen by the EU and the WHO as a "big health risk" with the possibility of death.
Dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and pundits suspect that "it was clear, but indirect evidence that this was a key reason for the uniquely high mesmerizing rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was placed in the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, asbestos exposed Alamy
The work of Julian Peto indicates that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected by the fact that "an essential part of the mesothelioma without known suspension through work or in the home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It seems that no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people were also exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service stations and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos from the committee's premises, whose lethal fibres could be raised by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is the case.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Western Front Palace received a "clean health certificate," it is now undisputed that 1 billion £of work will have to be raised over several years to renovate the parliament, renovate the electrical installations, and remove the asbestos, and that, following the general elections in 2015, the Members will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the Green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that 'the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the provisions in question'.
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost.
Everything that can be done is waiting.
A person who has never been able to determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have been working in a hospital in which asbestos claims have been positively contested," he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where you worked, and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, in which he received such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and a surgery was carried out late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It happened all the sudden.
I felt terrible.
I did not think I could go home any more.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the breast skin, the skin around his lungs, melted.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He was not working for a month.
At the end of the day, I was able to find out how to get the most out of it, and to get the most out of it.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health was slowly improving, and he returned to his job.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after physical activity and severe breathing.
In 2011 a patient Abbott was diagnosed with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But also now association Abbott does not do this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had been working directly with asbestos.
The link in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's state deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray shots to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the ribs and the breast skin.
I am an optimist.
I usually do more, "he says.
To be honest, I have not been so concerned at all.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly Abbott had meetings with Macmillan nurses, who recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now, he became aware of the scale of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings in which pipes were often isolated from asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings now fall ill.
And so Mesothelioma now affects younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos-insulation in hospitals were below ground, so patients probably have not been exposed to the substance rather than the substance.
However, many staff who were living in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or into underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to be in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that, over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving, but life-threatening for the treating physicians.
It is still being removed today.
Students presented their bunsenburners on asbestos mats.
And it is not just a matter of hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and town halls due to its fabulous insulation and flame retardant properties.
Schools, too.
Indeed, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemical dogs, students have put their bunsenburners on asbestos mats.
On websites, the issue of asbestos is now frequently addressed in schools.
Meanwhile, innocent objects in our houses, such as floor plates or shed roofs, contain asbestos by default.
"It is a commercial that is included in large parts of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who, Andrew Lawson, represented in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that struck a woman affected was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970 "s.
So be sure to pull down your garden shed.
The effects of diagnosis, and knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew that I had to go and I had to take care of myself.
Well, I will not experience another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty the change of perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was from all the information he had to cope with.
"It was very difficult to record everything," he said.
"I asked my doctor" how long have I still? "
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember, I thought "Well, I will not experience another Christmas.
That was'. '
Mesotheliom is particularly treacherous because it is our life support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is exposed and the fibres are inhaled, they can be fixed in the breast skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor, who moved to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital in which Andrew Lawson estimates that it exposed him to asbestos is, ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasury knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles achieve the lung tissue, says Treasure, "they are pushed to the edge of the breathing process, where the skin is.
From the beginning, it is from the very beginning an invasiv.
The usual options for other cancers do not work properly with Mesotheliom.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly contested.
Some say that it is worth trying.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut breast skin," he says.
They do not come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which has a "effect," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live for a long time, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is struggling.
After being contacted by Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and advisory office for co-sufferers.
"Hello, Criel," he was cheerful in inviting him.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years before and was still very active.
Originally Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which lasted four months and would probably only prolong his life for one month.
'i was desperate, "he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to make things appear in a slightly more positive light. "
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to be referred to, I simply called and got an appointment," explains Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a bank transfer and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for Mesotheliom sufferers to be able to use the best available therapies.
But, when these treatments invariably fail, many are affected by another financial worry - about the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960 "s was that it was recognized that even a very low level of exposure represented a health risk.
And here, business carelessness began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally made their case, but it was not what Morgan calls "full compensation" because Lawson was not able to prove with absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom was responsible for an Assurcontact at Guy's.
Following the investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy, however, confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990" s. "
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is the case for Mesotheliom sufferers, who are seeking compensation, a huge problem, one of the fatal asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there was a clear new legislation this year, making it easier for Mesotheliom sufferers to sue for compensation, even if their former employers no longer find them.
The law has set up a $350 million fund funded by the insurance industry, which was diagnosed after July 2012, able to establish contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiff will receive 80% of what a court might have been able to refer to in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 pounds.
Around 300 successful applications are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks so many mesotheliom stakeholders that 350 million pounds are a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of policyholders for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid, if the time did not pass through, and mesotheliom sufferers could find companies and sue them normally.
Even Mike Penning, who was a minister of labor and pensions, admitted that the law "is not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that a quick action was needed in the face of seven deaths every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Law in December of last year.
At that time Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-way therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
This is something that we see again and again with patients.
There is something that lets you go on.
If you enter, you are getting worse off.
Graham Abbott withdrew from the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Subsequent sorrows did not show any signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I was just 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That is life-abiding.
In addition, Abbott withdrew six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no longer any trace of tumours.
But the process is physically and psychologically very demanding.
You have to think of practical things - about the money when I am no longer, for example, or on my wife, how the pilot setting is working.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
They must look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's difficult for parents," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much.
When I was given my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I would have a disease that I wouldn't get rid of.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very social and undisturbed.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She said little.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients must get through.
But, for Mesothelioma, such talks are not driven by hope, not from a trail of hope for survival.
The disease (as, finally, also for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a grim security.

China denies Hong Kong right to government, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament, in spite of the increase in calls for democratic reforms, decided against the nomination of candidates for the election in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action was likely to fuel the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists bailed out the planning and mobilization to do so within a few hours.
The decision of the People's Congress of China allows the Communist leaders, as a matter of principle, to reject all non-eligible candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of China's decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in Hong Kong's elections would be "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain's control of Hong Kong left China back, Beijing promised to allow the residents to leave the government seat from 2017.
China's leaders presented the Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong's citizens have a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that China's leaders remain firmly in the hands of a tightly controlled nominating committee.
After a new clause, only candidates will be admitted "with love for country and love to Hong Kong."
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for many years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to cut off the financial district when Beijing does not allow real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, in the space of a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the government's headquarters in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience, and they planned to plan protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers informed that the "occupation" of the central county was considered only as the last resort, an action that is to take place only if all dialogue options have been exhausted and no other choice exists.
We are sorry to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the central county will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and there were stricter security measures, including police forces and barricades, on Sunday before the government.
The unrest is heightened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central movement's demonstrations, as they threatened business operations - Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests they talk could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they are going on," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has been critical of the movement for a long time.
We do not want to allay fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported about democracy activists in Hong Kong as a subversive agent led by Western powers.
This summer, organised activists organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights, involving 780.000 people - more than one-fifth of the electorate in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the biggest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of early school-leaving in the US is now being transferred to universities, where Freshmen are presented with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the first luxury travel service from Britain to students of today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transportation services such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said that the service had a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to travel through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A business speaker said that no new bookings have been made since the service was only introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also announced that, despite the tuition fees of $9,000 a year, there will be a market for this offer.
Students today differ in their expectations and requirements very much from the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can precisely do that.
The National Student Union, however, was critical of the service.
Megan Dunn, vice-president of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month are exposed to a crisis of living costs, because the available financial assistance in the form of loans and scholarships does not take up with the soaring bills for the simplest life base, before they can even think about spending thousands of pounds on such a thing as the arrival in the student residence.
Feminists criticise racial questions and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mois at the beginning of this month.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands high, not shoot," while they were waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown noted the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez a change in the online discussions white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminist commentators raise the sex in the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
But, while tensions in the Middle West began to gain attention across the country, Perez saw that white women's answers turned out to be 100% race.
In comparison with the responses of black women shortly after the conclusions of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "thoughts to Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the repression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I do not think that many people in feminism find many people talking about white and talking about high-class privileges," she said.
People felt compelled to say something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis that we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that it must be expressed.
For English professorship KAlgoritha Mitchell of the Ohio State University, Ferguson problems brought about the light that black American women are exposed every day, but they are not considered to be "women's women" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 Likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
If I have something to say about the fact that the colour of the black population in her own country is under siege, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" She asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex, and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the subjects; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now connect the subjects of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mason University, says that its predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were yellow and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history in order to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where the white fighter for the women's right, as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century, found that fighting for the right to vote could only be successful for each group: Women or blacks.
"You met the decision to stand up for the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
If you remember such things, you will be aware of the fact that white women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to be organized against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the wave of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson raised - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time in which white feminists played "fins" with the problems that black women faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists, who have such traditional feminist platforms, have the right to education of a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who build their careers in the struggle for reproduction rights and access to contraceptive methods are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Stone went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a prominent article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist of the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different, but parallel, reason to understand an inherent danger to the body - and opinions on race, which are clearly different in public opinion polls - can lead to the changes," wrote Steiner.
Although one is in favour of a more intersectional feminism, in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of their comments on the racial issue in America are perplexing.
Christina Sommer, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole Feminism?," said to She The People, that young men in the United States, especially young coloured men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their earlier critique.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But, as the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there have been angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is at the forefront of mainstreaming.
After the US border police took up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is returning to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for the reform of immigration, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as an essential woman, she only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
If the vast majority of the working visa is on male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are resonant in women's organisations," she said.
"Pigs House" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a property for sale was removed by property brokers, when it became clear that there was a big pig that had made it comfortably in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and will be offered for 120.000 £.
Among the details was a figure of the living room of the house - one of which was a pig that had put his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig on the photo is the pet of the owner.
"However, the photo was accidentally published and has now been removed," said a speaker from the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former collecting house as a "unique detached house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has the image removed from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house in the social media was of interest, as some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lottery win.
This month's Lottoplayer from Harvey this month.
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth will take place with a happy winner who receives almost $1.1 million from the lotus attraction on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey, for the second time in five years, won the jackpot in the draw of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner has to report back.
The shopkeeper Steve Forward said that the profit was for talking about in the small city in the southwest of Perth.
The city does not speak of anything else, and all are quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA-winners have celebrated profits in the first division last month, an orderly conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August, after a married couple from Belmont reached $7.5 million only a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them the possibility of a world tour and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire of Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the gladiatorial arena
Not only the gladiators were at the same time in Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Roman day in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1000 visitors yesterday to resist the rain and the autumn's cold, and were completely impressed by the historical spectacle.
There was a colourful string of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the Roman period and its importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was, without a doubt, the martial fighter force of the gladiatorial school "Amor Mortis," which took advantage of every rain break to demonstrate its robust campaign in the arena with soft sand.
Gladiator owners "Leonidas" turned out to be a humorous and knowledgeable presentator.
First of all, the "provocators" were on the row with square sign and short coat, and on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with a breastplate, a shortwave and a sling, as well as iron gladiator, bass and armguard.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "RETIARIUS," which took place in the "SECUTOR," and after a short fight the Burschen had fallen into the ground.
Because of the heavy-duty metal, the shields and the fumes floured through the arena, that a fear and cheek could become the health of gladiators.
However, the impressive "Summa Rudis," the muscular arbitrator, had always an eye-catching eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman day and to experience the culture of the Roman Age," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friends of the Roman channel," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park became an "Oppidum Romanum" for one day, a Roman city, as Vice-President Claus Wehage stated in his address.
After all, the Romans did not only have war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
It was also possible to admire the Roman day, for example "aqueduct-marble" of the 11-meter-high and 1400-metre-long Roman canal bridge, which stood at the back of the air.
The Frontinus society was once and now faced with water and power supply, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of then."
This is confirmed by the diploma surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "Engineering team 2" from Rheinbach, the surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894, as well as bricks from the original hypodermis, the warm air heater, which was once heated by the Roman villa.
Impressive with the footprints that had been left by Wolf and Fuchs in front of two millennia ago, before they were burned.
In 2011, the office for ground preservation at the Landesverband Rheinland was excavated the remains of a Roman villa at the Industrial Park Nord in Rheinbach.
The conversion of an economic building with a darre was found for the drying of grain and mosquitoes.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass cabinet, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the fall of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, is suspected Morscheiser.
The children were also working with the Roman wind-fighting game, similar to today's Mühlspiel, or they wrote their names with metal snips on wax boards, as was the case in Roman students.
At the state of the Roman therms Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay the mosaics themselves, at the booth of the glass museum Rheinbach Glasmosaiken, and at the Eifel Bar at the Eifel Nettersheim, a heavy wheat mill made a heavy wheat mill, to put the flour for a bread or a muesli.
Visitors came through the amusement park with two cold-blooded original Roman journeys, passing through the impressive state of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks" here.
With a Roman week between 13 and 21 September, the town of Wachtberg will also contribute to the end of the 19th century in the eastern part of the city, which will commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus in 2000 years.
Together with their home and history associations, as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the association of association and the horse-playing band Oberbachem, there are also thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes and remembering the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will tell of his work at the high level of Wachtberg, presenting plants as living thinkers from the Roman era, and offered a witty teaching lesson in terms of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and frequented by the Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous, often but no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg can be discovered again.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will be held at the Fund of the Berkumer Matron heiligalism in the year 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic strained West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned and international companies are on distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic hit the West African economy a heavy blow.
The harvest is rotated in the fields, the mines are leaving and the markets are orphaned - the virus has hit the region hard.
Some international companies, too, are already on distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit on the hardest hit.
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sold the second market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
In the market, there is only who wants to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus alone, with more than 600 people falling victim to fever.
Recently, health authorities declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
In Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, too, the virus has spread.
In total, more than 1500 people died, thousands of others were killed.
Foreign companies prefer employees from the beginning of the year.
Companies use their operations in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies, such as the Arcelor Mittal Steel Group, attract their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also responding: Few merchants leave their homes in order to obtain supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, there are, among other things, the export of important cocoa and coffee beans to the fields.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Foodstuffs become scarce.
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, "Paris" expert in West Africa's economy.
The man, for example, who is normally on the market and sells his vegetables, would prefer to stay at home.
The population, therefore, receives direct and pressing the consequences of the epidemic: Food is scarce.
On the markets, supplies of basic foodstuffs such as rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international firms, is threatened with an image of image - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest risk is that international companies tend to avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
What is decisive is how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors could get the impression that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, "warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the state budgets of the Member States.
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the states concerned.
The credit rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets are being severely strained by the high spending on the healthcare system and in addition from the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the affected countries "health systems with 60 million dollars ($45 million).
The effects are already being felt in Nigeria, where so far, only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region of the southern Niger Delta has not been affected so far.
But, elsewhere, many people remain afraid of contagion at home.
Even reservations made in hotels will definitely return.
Protection celebrate the 50th anniversary of the event.
The "Tannenwald" competition club is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.

The Nazi regime introduced the dissolution of the Association in 1937.
In 1964, another 19 young men were found, who, on 30 April at the inn Lukas, launched the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau.
Karl March and Adolf Ried brought the association as a champion by a difficult start-up period, in which it was primarily a question of finding a club locally and installing the firing line.
Already in the fall of 1965, the shooter club in the "Leininger" was launched with two teams in the race competitions.
In the following years, the sportswear, which has now been organized in seven teams, established itself in all classes to the 1st GauLeague.
The club records each year and the magic limit of 380 rings was achieved for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the power of the active shooter has increased, the membership numbers have also become a positive development.
After the association "Leininger" no longer meets the requirements of a modern contactor, the former CEO of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future domicile in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis" in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis" ("Landgasthof Härteis").
According to a work performance of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988, the priest Strasser for the new protégés was granted the ecclesiastical blessing.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gaushoot, coupled with the solemn consecration of the new protégés in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30-year anniversary.
In 1995, a group of villains was founded.
Josef Schmalzl was a laureate of the company.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the direction of the Bavarian Böll Meeting in 2005.
In many hours the club members modernized the rooms and the firing range at the Berngauer Hof last year and brought them to the latest state of the art technology.

NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday that NATO was in line with the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO boss, however, accused Russia of "a stark break" of the agreement.

Merkel speaks of power: Tolls will be "very clear"
Now, once again, the Chancellor has made a clear commitment to this.
But it is not a licence for all complicated details.
Stubborn concerns from the CDU against the cost of the car toll are rising sharply in the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken, after enduring resistance from her CDU, for the introduction of a car toll.
"To put it plainly: You stand in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the leader of the party on Monday after meetings of the CDU leaders in Berlin.
But, for the time being, Merkel has not set out a detailed model.
In the black-red government programme were 'certain parameters'.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and that is now being continued. "
The NRW-CDU, however, is insisting on its "no" to a toll on all roads.
Merkel has emphasized that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) has made a constructive contribution to the discussions on a bill.
Beyond the subject, he also talked about further ways of enabling more private capital to invest in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
"There is nothing special about this" on Sunday, on Sunday, on Sunday, a "mirror" report was left out, his house looked at his own concept to reimburse motorway-investors with tolls - after the election in 2017.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council
The Secretary of State of Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Convention was never supposed to have any impact on all circular and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian Christian Democratic Party.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that it will discuss the subject again.
Opposition to the plans comes from the CDU Regional Associations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background to this is the fear that a toll will affect small border crossings with neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had requested from the ranks of the CDU's coalition government because of the toll critique from the ranks of the CDU.
The left view the plans in the face of the dispute in the Union as a failure.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "Neue Saarnacher Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll of the minister," Dobrindt wants to introduce a sticker obligation on all German roads, which will start in 2016.
However, according to the coalition agreement, car owners must not be charged extra.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for tolls through the vehicle tax.
However, the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers, under EU law, because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A britin says that she thought of a misdiagnosis for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all of her youth in the belief that they had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another illness.
She was actually suffering from the Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that harm the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
We are looking forward to hearing from you!
Some 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which may lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe gear and curved toes.
The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms are getting worse at the moment.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she had a very poor chance of survival in Friedreich-Ataxie (FA).
Rodgers thought she was sitting in a wheelchair before she was 18, and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who are 51 years old today said: "As a child I knew that I could not do the same thing as the others.
I fell constantly and all lasted for me longer.
I never was able to ride with the other children's shoe or skateboard and was often used in school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that, at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve its Achilles heel and stretching her feet, she saw her sickbay when her doctor had left the room and saw that she suffered from Igloo.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I did not tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I was given an answer, I was shocked and I was shocked by panic.
I thought that I was 18 in a wheelchair and I was going to die with 25, and in the meantime I was losing all my abilities.
I did all this with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, it became clear that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up, and hugged me and said, "my love, I do not believe that you have that, otherwise you are now in a wheelchair."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests their CMT was detected.
"When he explained to me what was CMT, I felt as if I was a winner," she said.
This year, CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness month in order to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel A. D. Berni Diether has been working since the closure of the former troops as a firemen.
For almost ten years, the former troop level in Münsingen has been no longer able to shoot.
Still, deadly ammunition is still appearing at the heart of the Schwäbische Alb Biosphere Reserve still every month.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be blown up on the ground.
A deafening bang for explosions at the heart of the Biosphere Reserve.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was shot at the Münsingen training square, which was closed down in 2005 after 110 years of military operation.

The Tax of Business in Washington is rising with the economic recovery
The recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax exemptions for companies in the country grew slightly in the past year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a recent study last week, and firms in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District District, Maryland and Virginia, collectively pay $27.6 billion in public and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared with the 2012 earnings of $26.6 billion.
The company's state and local tax burden increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9% a year earlier, and it was the third year of growth following several years of declining decision-making in 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3%, according to the study carried out by the Ernst & Young service agency, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of Wen's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, produces the lowest tax revenues from companies.
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in real estate assets, say the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7% this year after the three consecutive years, with growth rates of less than 1%.
While much of these gains from large states such as California, New York, and Texas seemed to be, the process appears to be heading for Washington.
Corporations in the District, Maryland, and Virginia pay together more than $10 billion in state and local real estate transactions last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of one year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery of property values in Maryland is not so effective in raising government and local tax revenues, as property taxes amount to just over more than a fifth of the corporate tax rates.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area of D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay for property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
It is therefore forced to rely on income taxes, for example, in order to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the housing market.
Business revenue seems to be recovering, too, so the data.
Companies in the region have reported on income taxes in government organisations of $2.3 billion, compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase uniformly in all three places.
The rate of exit rate in the district was 4.3% of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia filed an under-average tax rate of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6% in all three areas of office, has significantly reduced corporate income taxes (all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, reduced state and local business taxes were demanded, as well as a better tax climate than in Maryland.
In the study, the District was not investigated.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina has passed legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5% next year.
If the government continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax to 3% by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses seem to be better off in Washington, and they therefore pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as a personal income tax by small businessmen - a transitional structure for which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland, and Virginia, increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a clearly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes in the entire country is probably to last this year, with an increase in general tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 in comparison with the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the Washington room may lag behind if the federal government's spending cut affects the labor market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hop and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a flight-direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou, is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be delighted if a German brewery would settle in our city," said Vice-party secretary of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Again and again, in the course of the conversation, the ruling Communist Party of China has returned to this concern of the Twelve-million metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also called canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, warb Li.
That is why people also have the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessian Social Democratic Party Chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he was going to listen to a potential partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer does not need much: Good water, cereals and joie de vivre," he added at the lunch with the top of the top in Guangzhou.
This joy of vitality has already been made by Mr Li, he flattered the host.
Then the businessman came from Guangzhou with Schäfer-Gümbel, but with a red wine that was served to eat.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More commercial transactions
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a flight-direct link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-party leader Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but dropped out of economic reasons in 2012.
"It would be worth it again," the local councillor politicians were convinced.
"Commerce between our two cities continues to grow."
Today, travellers would have to take the detour through Changsha in the Province of Hunan, complained Li.
Even the administration of Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is hoping for the flight connection.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire to the fore during his meeting with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," answered Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese vice-minister, Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nodded approvingly.
Cultivated partnership
The infamous Vice-party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the main, but not yet in this function.
He came into office only this year after his predecessor had been promoted to office for corruption charges.
The local party chief, Wan Qinglian, also had to go.
The action taken against government officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration imposed by the leader of Xi Jinping.
The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before he took office in Guangzhou, he worked as a leading company in Fujian, where the Autobauer VW built a great work.
Frankfurt is officially more than a dozen city-twinning companies.
The Guangzhou-based subsidiary of Guangzhou is one of the two sites that is maintained by both sides, such as a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South China metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic strength.
In the next year, she wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of €250 billion, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "expresses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since it was delivered to a hospital in New York City three days ago; her daughter, however, was now hopeful that the 81-year-old woman recovered from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We all press the thumbs.
According to her mother, in a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy was hospitalized on Thursday after an emergency, after an emergency, at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors regard them deliberately and carefully, until they are more satisfied with their status, which remains described as' serious'.
The reactions came from many pages, also in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaner and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners who are coming to trade from now on, stricter environmental standards will apply in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from September 1 will receive a label on which the buyer can recognize central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars in the pollutant category "Euro 6" more stringent nitrogen oxide levels are valid.
Moreover, there is more money for the scaffolding: The minimum wage of EUR 10.25 is received per year.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
Amazon confirmed just what information was reported on Monday morning: The online retailer and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because nobody expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google for a cool billion, and cooperation appeared, of course.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv was started as a general distribution service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it was quickly becoming a platform for players who wanted to play their brave pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which the better known (mostly older) games are a painting of the Secret Science Theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just that YouTube is often called, if you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube Twitch was wanted to buy a bit is included, a textbook example of an established technical company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come about because the company was reportedly prepared to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything that we know at the moment is this statement from Emmet Sears, President of Twitch: "We have chosen Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who say that they prefer to play sport rather than watching them, it is difficult to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others while playing the control panel.
It is one thing to look at a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning while living with Resident Evil, and something quite different to see how he is shot in the head for 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You can now watch all of these games now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are now home-games, so it can be a good recipe for headaches without your own control over the viewing angle.
I agree that the fast-track, in which the Roger Banners of our electronic publication complete games in record time, are entertaining.
However, as long as there is no chance of being played or Humorvirtuoso, his twitch channel is probably not so very interesting.
But what do skeptics know like I do?
Twitch is called from 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated in Amazon Instant Video, how YouTube Twitch can simply swallow.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to have: Thousands of young men who are recruited as advertising.
Like the chairman of Twitch, Siss, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of contraction, not even - sip - as a spectator sport.
On the hip of the castle there was a lot of trouble on Sundays.
The concept of the organizers agreed.
Despite the strong rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the ban had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt-precious l light and fun.
Two Spanish words have formed the name Amula in the name of Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem.
The open air in the salt-covered Burggarten is intended to brighten up the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun is anyway by yourself.
This was already evident in the early Saturday of the first visitors to the open air.
A festival for all generations had promised the organizers.
And they managed to do so.
Around the branches of the castle in the castle garden, salt refiners, as well as guests from the near and other surroundings, made their holidays pleasant.
They followed the first live performances, with the foot in the rhythm, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: Pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced.
And this across generations.
While the one on the ceiling on the extra washed white sand on the beach bar, others took part in a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the offspring at the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests, took place.
However, even with children's children, the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had to do all their hands in order to become the champion of the crowd and conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces.
The larger ones used the kickertables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which created the Goodfoot crew from salsa.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. prasselte took time to the visitors, mainly families were looking for space and drying.
But the attraction of the festival did not detract from this.
"More people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."
That is why a repeat of the big party next year is out of the question.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked out, Sem made a first record on Sunday against the folk voices.
He told him that he had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently the security company was booked with too little effort.
The result: Some who had already paid were no longer on the site.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the salt-precious co-organizer of about 1200 visitors took part in the Burggarten tumbled.
There were problems with audio engineering.
The salt-noble hip-hop band blocks'n'Rox broke out due to their appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably sound sound.
The planned shisha lounges were not able to be built because the tents could not be brought to salsa because of a tire block.
"In the coming year, they will be present," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made a number of mistakes that have been made for the first time, but must be removed in the second edition.
Even in the social network Facebook, the organizers of the event will have to find a critique.
"Sorry, but for 12 euros you simply expected," Melanie Meier prints on the event page.
"You have taken a bit over you," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others are not so close to the initial problems.
I think it is very good that some are not just stupid, but also really try to put things on their feet.
Hats off, "writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now, the organisers will have one year to put an end to these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark
That is not so.
Instead, the built-in part is waiting to be used in this remarkable building.
The action stands in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the development of the space observatory TIRA, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
With a diameter of 47.5 metres, the new Radom will be a little smaller than the old one.
However, the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the Kappentausch.
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that the last quarter of the new case will be set up.
If the weather is involved, the action will take place at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge surpasses the jaws of the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK shouted so much when her icy water was cast over the head, that she lost the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket Challenge was painful as well.
A woman was hospitalized after she had so much at the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she had gone out of the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK created so much that her icy waters were cast over the head, that she defied her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaws were simply standing," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is spilled over the 20-year olds.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth close, but that was not, the jaw was blown, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this and made up almost in the pants, but I had to go into the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was hospitalized in order to allow the jaw to be released again after participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the Burns soon be joining in the same direction?
Last but not least, there was again between the two Wolfratshauser castles.
Now, the pros are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former Chairman of the Wolfratshauser of Burgundy, performed the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
So far, the views of the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction have so far seemed different.
Now, the two camps are moving towards each other: They will soon be discussing joint action.
This is confirmed by the boards of directors of Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both clubs could be pulling together in the future.
In this way, progress has been visible more quickly.
While the Burgern around the sudden Richard Dimbath, to the last a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forest, stands at the forefront for the Burgverein around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, Chairman of the Burgern, was very pleased with the call.
He was a member of the House of Lords as a result of Liu's death.
A new president is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
Currently, the club has about 40 members, according to the 74-year-olds.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we left the club's activities out of respect first." This "period of thinking" was necessary to consider how to move forward. "
According to Piffl, the new president will then meet with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle's fans could also make a current mood in their group.
There is no candidate for the presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to stand, because he has his place of residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to continue to work on the project "but will continue to work."
The different views on reconstruction will remain in the eye of Piffl in the near future.
He honours Dimbath as a missionary who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, far-reaching projects in Austria and France, would show that this idea was not an air disaster.
Through a high level of public participation, as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also sceptical at the beginning.
But over time I have gained more and more conviction that it makes sense to move the project forward. "
There is nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be able to finance the project by means of EU subsidies, visitor-tickets and potential sponsors.
"The idea of reconstruction does not, personally, I want to throw away," he hopes that the Burgverein might perhaps be moving in that direction.
Its purpose to document history first, "is important and good."
We could look forward to that.
Smart ways to save university textbooks
As the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the Fast-Two-Year student Matt Schroeder gave a clever saving idea.
He invented a loan system for books of higher semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay restitution.
"My mathematical book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, who attended the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
There was $120.
The management announced that students spend more than 1,200 $per year on textbooks and study material, but that there would be a variety of cost-effective options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches like the Schroeder are increasingly the choice for students.
The rent of textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that the rents of text books have doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented at the College bookstores in the last spring year, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
According to the Trade Association of College Stores, less than half of all textbooks are bought in campus bookstores.
Here is the first one for the best deals.
Online Buy
Some new books cost online just a third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookshop.
The ninth issue of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained at the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for 239.99 $.
Buying Buy
If one of the notes of other or normal usage tracks makes no sense, then used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed to have at Chegg.com for 93.49 $.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduation student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent on Amazon.com 42 Cents spent a second edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts on Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether former spending was allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older issues can often be acquired for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting holidays
The rent of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to give them back and you do not want to keep the books after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for about $20 for the duration of a semester.
Find out about the rules of the business that you rent, including fees for writing notes, undercuts or usage tracks.
Renter: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
Also e-Books instead of traditional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of major retailers such as Amazon.com, Chegg as well as Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, since many classics nowadays can be downloaded free of charge, while scientific and scientific textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look at each case.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be visiting Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price of books, because you can be so sure of finding the right textbook.
And before placing an online order, you should check to see if the book is in stock.
This lesson learned the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookshop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" was not a cashier's job.
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only played $12 million in its budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" directed to Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million during the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon thighs slightly made 2" also disappoint their earnings.
An article by the Telegraph, Robbie Collin, suggests that the children's films could be the reason for the lack of quality in the films themselves.
"The worst year," in 2014, was described as "the worst year" for children's films and described "dragon steels easily made 2" as a pure "functional" fantasy continuation.
In the case of films for a somewhat older target group, it seems as though the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for every summer film that was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and in the current year on at least 2,000 canaries.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics, and suggest that this year's film hits are equal to those of last year.
Some commentators have said that the development is due to changing visual habits and growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Romney's upcoming jungle book, said to the website of Hollywood Reporter: "I think the times change."
We have to accept that and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood production, Netflux has recently generated sales of $1.2 billion in streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to 837 million dollars.
In the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on the cartoons of comics, and prophesied a "heartbeat" Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could well contain a true core.
Due to the potential cash-holders to be expected in the summer of 2015, among them: Age of Ultron, Minions, and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the fall in the record results as simply "cyclically" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer on the cinema, and no one will worry about the business."
As a few years ago the second table of table tennis for tightening the Ligen classification, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Association has put an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result: Who did not raise up has gone up.
For example, in the next season, Magpedo's best team Torpedo has avoided the descent, but is only a fifth and fifth season in the season ahead.
It was the first time in the United States of America to win the Grand Prix of the Grand Prix of the Year.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Primary League, as well as the boys of the SC Weuss.
The SG Lengders and the Torpedo reserve are present in the new association league, in the National League are no longer a divinity club.
Women play the TTV Geismar in the association's league, the Torpedo-Second in the National League.
What the composition looks like a better class class is now the new district league of the South.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district league, as the regional representative Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III, the Councilors of the Women begin at least in Sollstrength.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllnsausen are starting off in the district league.
With 9 teams each
The SC Weeper sends his girls to the small regional league.
Also the regional league season of the SCW boys - there is also Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded Regional Association, the two Nepalese teams started the race with nine teams each.
In the West season are Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfeld SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengders II.
In the East squadron, Sattenhausen / Wöllhak ausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen are playing.
The Women's League consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllhak ausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG rhume.
This is still better than Easter egg, where there are no female teams in the circle.
What is striking is that none of the six 2.2 classes are achieved; here, the innovative and restless leader will have to think about it.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people met in Cardiff in front of the city hall, to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has watched the developments during the weekend and have spoken to demonstrators who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teens from the Blue Mountains exclaimed
Two young girls were brought to safety after they were caught up in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man arrived at Govett Leap in Blackheath just after Sunday at noon.
Concerned relatives called the police at around 20 p.m. when the two were unable to return home.
A search term from local police and rescue services broke out and the pair was found around about 23 p.m. near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had turned on his knees and the man was toppled and beaten his head.
Rescue forces stayed overnight at the pair, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable state with a ambulance in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Anti-Syrian protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1000 demonstrators were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
After almost half an hour, the transmitter resumed the broadcast again.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks could have damaged devices in the editorial office.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
The protesters are calling for the resignation of the Head of Government, accusing them of electoral fraud.
The police told us about a kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Monday, on Monday, the clashes of around 3000 demonstrators came with security forces.
After hospitalization, a policeman was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured as demonstrators tried to invade Sharifs Residenz.
They call for the Prime Minister to resign.
The powerful military, on Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters, called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and using force."
Furthermore, it was said in the communication: 'The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state'.
The escalating violence has stirred up concern for military intervention, which has already spread more frequently in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif does not accept a resignation.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to resist.
"We will not go back without being forced to resign without Sharif," said Khan.
Qadri said similar.
Khan accused Sharif of having won the parliamentary election in May last year by means of fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then, a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the government quarter.
The demonstrators had, first, peacefully before the parliament, until Khan and Qadri ordered them to enter Sharifs Residence at the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after two season victory on place three of the table.
With the 2: 0 above size, for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday made a conciliatory end.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate level in the European League on Thursday.
"The success story was very important," confirmed Captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who met with green-white for three.
With the second round of the season, Rapid was the right response to the disappointment at Helsinki, with a chance of success in the national game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Foreign Minister Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership Volley from the sixteenth century, set the course for victory at the 14th minute.
"I thought I was going through the whole gyn of Thursday and slashed it under the carpet," the 26-year-old gave smiling.
For the last time in a "Bundesligapartie" on November 13, 2010, this was still the case for Ried.
For this reason, the first series of champions of the Rapid-Dress will remain in a special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the rapid young," said scoop.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term tie, Mario Pavelic moved from the left to the right defensive side and made his case very good there too.
He has had enough experience that he can also misinterpret this position.
The gate has earned him, he has already done some assimilation, "praised Barisic.
Team shows character carts also supplied the flank to 2: 0 by Hofmann after an hour that finally brought the decision.
After all, it would have been possible for the guests to write to the hotel.
"Thank God we have had some luck today," he noticed, that the difference between performance and results in recent weeks has been: "The results did not vote, but the playful was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even thought that "in many games, it was better than today - against" the strongest team that played in this stadium this season. "
The first three points since 26 July have thus proved that the team structure has remained intact for the setbacks: "Today, my team has shown that it has character."
For him, it is no less heartening: "That we have finally played back to zero."
A lot of work during the national break also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start releases, make the victory even more valuable.
"We must not forget this," in the last three days, the Barisic, who lost a great deal of stability in the last three days, was "very stable."
The national period must therefore be used to lick "wounds" and to give a little to the physical activity, "explained Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in its ranks.
One of the reasons for the pause is captain Hofmann.
He fights for the team, goes beyond pain.
It is precisely at this difficult time that he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "Barisic said.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his confusion in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also achieved the second gate.
For the 33-year-olds who played his 350 Bundesliga game, it was the first hit from the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 on the admira).
Hofmann: "Must not believe that everything is good now." We certainly have a bit of luck, but at some point the luck will have to come back to us too.
Now it was high time, "said Hofmann.
He exited, however, concentrated work: "One should not always see black and white.
We have not played so badly in recent weeks, as has been shown.
We must not, however, believe that everything is right now.
He couldn't deny the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team which I can help at the moment.
They seem to think of me in certain phases, "said Hofmann.
Michael Baur's chief coach, Michael Baur, had little to blame for his team.
He regretted the quick countervomiting "from the Magic Gate," as well as the regular gate of Nutz at the 40 minute, wrongly detected by referee collegger.
The only criticism I can make to the team is that we are not specific enough in some stages of Tor.
We have had too few qualifications.
Interior defenders of Maximilian Karner saw it in a similar way: "It has started badly, but then we have found it and even made a gate.
On the whole, it would have been more in place.
There is a rush at the bottom of this summit.
We have shown a mighty strain on our ridding of the summer series "My piece of the Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the extracted specimen is the "scourges" above the Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak tree.
It goes past capping, basalt and basalt rocks.
A little bit below the quarry of Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
This is a natural monument, it towers above the other trees of the area and reminds us about eight metres to an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a smokescreen indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But, despite intensive research, there was nothing but references to the name's name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and questioned the elderly people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what proportion of suffering has been associated with the scourge of the plague.
The results of his investigation remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds had driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn out of the labyrinths and stones liberated from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animals who were exhausted by the climb should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows it is in real time again goat-herd.
The area has also been declared a core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, which has further identified Schneider.
You should exercise caution when entering the stone collections, because the basalt, which is warmed by the sun, is also a popular choice for cross-liners.
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but it is hidden away.
Further ways are signposted, heading towards Hochrhön and inviting for an extended hike.
Where is the Wasserburg?
However, a Wasserburg, which is looking for the next task, is very rare to find.
The mirroring in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district that could fit the building counter.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner's happiness"?

After weeks of tumours, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the Council, Matteo Renzi, have imposed strong conservative opposition at the EU special summit last week to nominate his Minister for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini as the head of EU foreign policy, you will be the successor of the British leader, Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, like the government-related newspaper La Repubblica, sees the appointment of his political team as Favorine as Favorite, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He is also expecting a boost to his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to keep quiet the party-based party, which is becoming increasingly popular, because Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit in a moderate manner.
Against the Conservative representatives with the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Tusk, the predominant opinion in Rome, is to create a political settlement.
The chief diplomat of the EU, at the same time, is the deputy of the President of the Commission, Juncker.
The pending consent of the European Parliament is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have known the nomination of the 41th politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important acknowledgement" of the Italian role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that for almost two decades, well-known Mogherini, renowned for its ambition, has grown to meet the "enormous challenges."
Born in Rome, he is married and has two daughters.
His party career began his doctorate in political science in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left-wing Democrats) who joined the Catholic Centre Party Margherita in 2008 with today's Social Democrat PD.
In 1999, Mogherini was appointed Vice President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Jungsocialist) for three years.
With the election in 2001 at the party leader of the left-wing Christian Democratic Party, she went to high party politics, worked in the Foreign Policy Department, the director of which she soon became.
They took the traditional focus of Italy's foreign policy, such as the Middle East, through studies on NATO operations in Afghanistan, where Italy was involved with a troop contingent, established contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert in defence and European affairs.
When Renzi became Premier in February 2014, he headed Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If, today, the PD returns a better relationship to the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's 40% vote in the May EU election, as in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The conversations in Brussels, the new EU external representative, which have too little diplomatic experience, lack the substance, will be able to do so in the PD.
In Brussels, in particular from Poland and the Baltic Member States, there is a lack of realism in fashion by Mogherini in relation to the crisis in Ukraine and diffused as a "soot-friendly course."
It supports the South Stream pipeline, launched by the Russian company Gazprom, through which Russian gas can be transported directly to southern Europe via Russian gas, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi began his term as EU president in July, Mogherini traveled to her first state visit to Moscow.
Photos taken by Putin in Shake-hands were greeted with indignation in Brussels, and that they invited the Kremlin's head for October to a Milan-based economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at EMZ-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Below is a trainee who has already completed another training in the company before.
In four training occupations, the new employees are active in the future: Electronic engineers (three apprentices), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and procedural mechanics (two).
All apprentices are coming from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Buchl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Michgaden, Johannes Beer from Ninburg in front of the woods, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel carefree and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees have previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all ages and trainers are invited to a teambuilding event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a whole day walk and rafting on the Inn are on the agenda.
The company has a total of 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees is spread over all year round, 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouth" and put France in order, "said François Hollande's main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "her love" for the disputed socialist president, whose cabinet-building was defeated by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said at great applause.
As a appeasing gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government did not question the controversial 35-hour week in France in spite of fierce calls for the regulation of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for the Economy.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his co-socialist leaders to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, went into the gear of transport in which she appeared at a meeting of renegade socialist MEPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far right leader of the National Front, derided the permanent revolts of the Socialist Group and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would hold for longer than a few months.
François Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls does not have either, they are forced to form a new government if the old one did not survive a summer.
"And the new will not survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen for supporters.
She reiterated the call of her party after Parliament's dissolution and said she was confident enough to emerge victorious in pre-election elections and be ready for government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat at the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A poll in Sunday's Journal du Dimanche found that 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party is under the risk of disintegrating in several rival groups before the end of the term of Hollande's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government did not pay to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must feel fast, that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Virgin Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of €3 billion.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the world's third largest cross-agency provider, conducts advanced negotiations on the purchase of the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for around $3 billion, according to experts in the industry.
A deal would give a deal to Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and to its wealthy customers, while it is competing with major rivals like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, saying the sources on Sunday and warned that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also has a share of 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources demand that they remain anonymous because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker on Apollo refused to comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise liners on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues were $2,57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also in Miami, operates under the brand names of Oceania and Regent, who jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to last year.
The cruise industry has a total of around $29 billion, and in the next few years, it is expected to grow in emerging countries such as China and India due to the strengthening of the middle class.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice at the cross-suppliers.
Prestige Cruises applied for the IPO in the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo was the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was born in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cross-country carrier in the possession of Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested €1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares and the private equity firm TPG Capital LP at the end of June, according to the authorisation authorities, a 8% stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise, together according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises, have more than 82 percent of the passenger capacity on American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A Facebook-based group moved close to the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday adopted a framework legislation permitting only two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the majority support of a Nomination Committee, which is expected to be filled with contingent members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be admitted to the election, prompting pro-democracy activists to secure their threat and to paralyze Hong Kong's financial center with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's leaders fear that the calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which in June China's dominance of Hong Kong was set out, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and organised a sit-in-party there.
Lis's survey is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice-President of the Office for Foreign Affairs of Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted in the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they will meet in the afternoon in front of the Hong Kong leadership office.
Britain saw no democratic elements in Hong Kong for the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin requires Kiev to accept "government talks" with eastern Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian Government stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, explained later that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine, which is under the control of the separatized territory of eastern Ukraine, will be a part of Russia, but that its status with Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on equal terms with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy that he seems to follow since the beginning of the riots five months ago: Help for the separatists in taking land and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state television channel channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the separatists held in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized in March and April, after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently described the occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "neurossiya," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary period of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the wake of Ukraine's pro-election campaigns for the elections on 26 October, and while governments attack civilian communities in the territories held by separatists in the separatist areas, hope "in their illusions," reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to engage in detailed discussions without delay, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and state status of eastern Ukraine in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood in the context must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev government to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only Ukraine's government can give the eastern areas the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
Clarification of the Kremlin's spokesperson for correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and polls from the period before the conflict revealed a broad majority in Ukraine.
The autonomy raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thereby giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects Russia's territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region of Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries, which produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his speech to the inauguration on 7 June, suggested that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should bear in mind amendments to the Constitution with which the relevant areas are given greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels who are accused of arming and murdering Moscow.
Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on equal terms was followed after a further advance of the rebels in the past week after Russian troops and tanks invaded the pre-peaceful region along the Azov Sea in eastern Ukraine.
The separatist separatists supported by Russia, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, took the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, control of Nowoasowsk.
It is for this reason that massive civilian and military preparations have begun in order to establish Mariupol, a steel industry harbour with 500,000 inhabitants, which is between Novoasovsk and a narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are very close to a point of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit decided not to take concrete action, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in an uncertain escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were included in Ilowajsk by the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers, who had been taken prisoner a week ago in Ukrainian territory, informed Lysenko on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal about Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger over hackers, who probably lost nude pictures of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the A celebrities from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement, after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the internet in a hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible has more than 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star from "the tributes of panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dune.
From the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were allegedly also publicised private photos due to a icloud loophole.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who had died last month with Grecko, said to the Confidential: "It is disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news site that the hack was "shameful" and that those affected were "injured."
The hacker has probably 30 images from Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which they appear without being in a pool.
The Palmers film works belong to "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the chopped images yesterday.
A representative Lawrence said: "It is a heinous violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Chained images from a mobile phone to post is nothing different than the sale of Hehlerware."
In purely legal terms, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
At the 8th wheel, riders, joggers and trekkers were present at the Big Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the club "Help for Cretan children."
The tour, which was a gate, was an easy training for the other people.
However, everyone agreed on one thing: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski should have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life the head of Oberurseler Brauhaus was riding the wheel on the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He can easily get rid of the small muscle cater, especially since he personally took a valuable insight into the participation of the 8th wheel on the Great Field Mountain in favour of the "Help for Crebarium" (Frankfurt).
A great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - great!"
A little bit on the way out in the applet?
Snow, if I had stopped once I would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is a member of the CDU in the Oberurseler district parliament, many of the 718 participants died in the spring in the spring and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the 11-kilometre stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
At the end of the day, you will be able to find out how to get the best out of the year.
He also went through the track in a slide, like Nina Kuhn, the press secretary of the town of Oberursel, who, together with Frank Grüneisen, had embarked on the path.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be there - an exit would have been made today anyway," according to Kuhn.
On the way, they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) went to Oberursel in the morning to get back to the height in the morning.
In the morning at 9 o'clock in the morning at 9 o'clock at home in the saddle, the Feldberg "made" the Feldberg two times to roll back home with a lot of fun.
There was also a "Fritten-Toni" (Fritten-Toni).
For the head of the Oberurseler cult shop, bicycle tours through the Feldberg simply belong to it.
He had hit 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racetrack.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to do so ", Andreas Balzke said.
The more experienced Mainzer says that he is an "ambitious racing company."
It must also be because he was on the road with the "fix" bike, which is also racing bikes, but without circuit...
Even without a wheel, it was not only the 20 trekkers who climbed above the White Wall and the steering wheel to the top of the summit, but also a jogger who, at a Kordel, climbed an autoclave with a set of weights.
There are a lot of things that need to be done in the near future.
The 718 participants - and therefore as many as never before - were sent back to groups in the morning.
The first day of the trip, the hotel was very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 am.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers left.
Bent Hansen, leader of the association "Radden on the Great Feldberg," gave the start commandos and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route to the Feldberg, to the safety of the participants.
