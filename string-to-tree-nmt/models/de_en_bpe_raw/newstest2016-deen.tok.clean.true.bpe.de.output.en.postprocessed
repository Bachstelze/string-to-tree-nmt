Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and on Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, when it comes to the meeting, it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution being discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been challenging for years.
Washington has criticized the continuing settlement of Israel and reproaches Netanyahu for a lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama deal on Iran's nuclear program has worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu held a controversial speech at the US Congress's invitation to the US Congress, partly viewed as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting with reference to the upcoming election in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call professor to have his girlfriend shot dead.
In an emergency call Professor Shannon Lamb, with a somewhat rude voice of the police force, he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his home.
Lamb had it important to stress that his "sweet dog" still live and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone.
Inside the house, the officials found the corpses of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was covered by a white block: "I am sorry, I wanted to cancel it, I was sorry, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, was already running 300 miles from the school premises, where he left a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office and killed him.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university employees have heard shooting at 10: 18.
He said that Lamb eventually made the disastrous emergency cry.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life, when the police took him.
One day after the shooting in the university, which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to give an image of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as that of students and staff who knew him, helped create an image of a talented, but perhaps difficult, teacher.
Students have said that they are looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he has no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the 'wonderful people' with whom he shared his academic life.
Both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, of which 17 members include 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some exclusions of problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, praised the Lamb, said that he also seemed somewhat excited and nervous "as though something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for an assurance for health reasons and said that he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment policy meant that the promotion, for which lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way of hiring a Assistant professor.
University's president, William LaForge, said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea."
These are issues that the Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
After the flight from the campus, the police took a trace of Lambs when he was killed in Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house, around a mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner methel Johnson.
His car was still in the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why lamb came to this House, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the university, which was a city of 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He holds a PhD in pedagogy in the spring.
One of his long-time girlfriends called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20, when she met with shared friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar.
He was the women's cock at that time.
All girls slept there when he was there, "said Hairston, 40 now and at the Jackson Vorstadt of Brandon.
Lamb and prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency call Lamb "I have killed my wife," but there was no document from a marriage.
They had a dog called lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which borders a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was in order.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was 19 years of age.
"She was completely on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O 'Steen said that he had never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both on a summer-year-year-old-market.
Later they played together with one or other Gig.
O 'Steen said, his daughter writes and sings their own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several companies on-line.
Mike Shaffer, a Barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weak illuminated bar in the vicinity of Gautier, said that he finished Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished finishing his guitar and mouthharmonikaspiel before a scarce audience.
There was no evidence that something was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
The staff was very friendly and helpful.
I think they both had a good sense of trick.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the School.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of his brother and student committee.
On Tuesday evening, the Delta State Campus in Cleveland took about 900 people, including lecturers, employees, students and members of the community on a candlelight commemoration.
Schmidts Mrs. Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Memorial Church, during the Universitatschor "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We try to move our students to move," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Chief Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect the fact that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that lamb called Prentiss as his wife, but there was no indication that the two were ever married.
Toys R Us plan to set fewer workers for the Christmas period
Toys R Us say that there are not as many Christmas-season staff as in the past year, but the toy and baby products traders say that he will give the current staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company has said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month will start with applications and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
During the holidays themselves, Christmas business is moving closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to equip shops with employees who sell, sell and sell products.
Michael J. Fox sang on his "Date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty and it is gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated gambler and an Arrow length to be at a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the future" had a premiere 30 years ago.
"It's for me really," said Spielberg, "uncontested the biggest time-tracking movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
One boss says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's reinforced military support for Syria is "there is no military solution" of the almost five-year-old conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief, once again, calls for all parties, including the agreed UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that it plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - the US, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - at the margins of the General Assembly of the General Assembly this month, in order to discuss the situation in Syria.
It deplores the fact that the divisions within the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation unsolvable unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 poll numbers showing that Donald Trump will be taken seriously.
Some have tried to mark him as a flop.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
However, no matter how some Republicans try to pull up Donald Trump from the top ranks in surveys, it has not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys have shown Donald Trump in double-digit terms, and some are beginning to wonder what it means for the chances of the nomination of Real Estate Moguls.
Of course it is still too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at this time in 2011, Rick Perrys's leadership was issued to the rising Herman Cain, none of which won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why it should have a general election.
But outsiders, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth, now recognize Trump's persistence and begin to move their dollars to topple down.
Here are some current poll numbers indicating that the Real Estate Mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trulles's popularity rating has rotated 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll of Monmouth-University showed that only two out of ten Republican Republicans saw the Real Estate Mogul positively.
By mid-July, there were 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now, six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Some three out of ten say that they have a negative view.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week noted that 60% of Republicans have a good view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey of CNN / ORC last week, 67% of Republicans said that they were either "excited" or "satisfied," when Trump was nominated.
Only two out of ten are saying that they would be "upset" if it were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates the same enthusiasm as Trump (43% say that they would be "enthusiastic" versus 40% that say the same about Trump.
The next in matters of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they are "unhappy" or "angry" if Yeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for its bombastic and offensive statements, 52% of Irish voters who left Irish voters believe that the Real Estate Mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number was seen in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52% of Republicans thought that he had the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44% think that he did not have the personality to be effective, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament did not fit into the White House, such as ABC / Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put their promises, Republican voters hold Trump for real.
When asked who most likely wins the GOP nomination, after a survey of CNN / ORC last week four out of ten that Trump was the best bet.
This is a shift since then when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Yeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Yet a large number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump is almost everyone else.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-on race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump has gained majority support.
He has before Carly Fiorina 13 points ahead, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Yeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-on-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who proposes it?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hypothetical head-on race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have formed their opinions.
A new poll by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of those voters who support Trump say that they have won their votes.
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.
46% said that it left the door open to switch to other candidates.
However, Trump's strongest competition at the moment of the other outsiders, the Neurochirurg Ben Carson, but voters who say that they had formed their opinions, are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the subject of immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called "rapists," in his election campaign two months ago, immigration was central in the public discourse in 2016.
Some people are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump's major Hispano Americans will remain remote from the Republican Party, and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC / Post poll on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say that they agree with Trump on issues of immigration.
So long as immigration remains in the limelight, Donald Trump seems to be doing so.
Frustration over the government is spreading to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now about half the support of Republican voters, especially by their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new monday poll by ABC / Post, they want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, with 54% "unhappy" and 21% of anger.
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in Hobookenweg you will find the most expensive condominium with a view over the North Sea watt.
In the street, one square meter of a dining attic room costs a total of 73,300 Euro.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says it in the study, so the high price.
A new study shows that in which special locations a square meter is the most expensive.
Of course, EUR 18.70 per square metre for a student bude in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top-conditions, one of the prices, like Peanuts, arises.
The real estate agency Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German locations - with square meter prices at a staggering altitude.
There are ten thousand euros per square meter per square metre.
But well, who can do it...
By the way: For once, Munich is not at the top of the list.
Champions League: Bavaria-Dream Start thanks to Muller and Götze.
Two times in Piraeus: The Bavarian star Thomas Müller has just set a course.
A lucky hit from Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to make the way to a 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then he went on.
A victory for the Champions League season.
The World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan."
The team of coaches Pep Guardiola won the medal in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere due to Shell Double Pack (52nd / 90th / 90. + 2) and Götzes (89th), with 3-0 (0-0).
The twelfth start-up in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola will finally have the Henkelpott in Munich at last.
With his 28 hits in the Champions League in the Champions League, he received enthusiastic support from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who left the world championship as the flanking of the world champion.
"We will not underestimate them," Bavaria's captain, Philipp Lahm, promised before the match in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and Munich kept its word.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without glittering.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the premier class, including Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
In the meantime Borussia Dortmund (1: 3) stumbled on this.
But the Bavarian, in seven Europacup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but they were often unwittingly engaged in their offensive efforts.
The attacks have become too often a shift on the left Douglas Costa, which has rarely seen the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck on the right hand than his flank from the right-wing field in the left upper gate.
At the 67th minute, the World Champion gave the figure possible 2-0.
The best opportunities in half were Robert Lewandowski.
First, as Olympiakos storm Ideye Brown shot the head ball of Poland from the line (26).
Then via Direct, the goalkeeper Roberto came with his knees (35th).
Although the Bavaria raised their usual-dominant game, Pirew could set needle-stick.
However, there was a ban on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
For example, when he took a shot of Ideye over the Latte (56th).
Later on, Guardiola defended a four-bed chain with David Alaba in the centre alongside Jerome Boateng, who made it well.
Mario Götze, after musculent problems in cadres, was initially sitting outside.
The World Championship Hero has given the green light only after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to make something different from it, it's already malicious."
Even when the first change took place, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman to the battered Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made 13 minutes later everything clear, by Elfmeter employed Müller.
Before the match, there were riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially surrounded Bavarian fans in their spectator-block appeared to be provoked by the followers of Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked the security forces against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bavarian fan was injured from the stadium.
If you smoke, you have a higher risk of losing your teeth.
If you smoke, it damages not only the lung but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study.
The good news: If you cancel the risk, the risk will be fast.
Smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early.
This is derived from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute of Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of getting rid of their teeth by 2.5- to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had watched over 23300 participants.
The main cause of failure is caries and inflammation of the gum, emphasizes the DIfE.
For these parodontitis, smoking should be a risk factor, emphasize the authors.
The connection between smoking and loss of waste therefore occurs on more frequent gum infections.
It is not clear whether smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking would be able to reduce their risks within a short time, however, write the researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research."
However, it could take more than ten years before the threat to the level of non-smokers became apparent, explained Erzutor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
You need to convince people to become a non-smoker, the student leader Heiner Boeing from the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the life time."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vascular vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to age.
In Germany, more than 20% of the population aged 65-74 has been affected by toothlessness.
Earlier investigations had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early teeth failure.
The new long-term assessment underpins the findings.
Archaeologists of the Cologne Rhine bear witness the remains of the Late Ancient Roman Empire.
Archaeological finds have been made in Cologne on the right bank of the Rhine.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic-Museum have excavated the skeleton and remains of historical buildings, said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction works on the Rhine, historians have been searching for the so-called 'Ground Monuments'.
In all building projects in the city district of Cologne, the Museum is always taken into consideration as a specialist in the archaeological heritage of the city.
The archaeologists were discovered in the third part of the Rhine Triangle.
From text documents it was already known that in the 4th century there was a fortress and a church in the 8th century, which was explained by Trier.
In addition to the ruins of the fortress and the church tower, there was also a cemetery with about 350 graves, which was probably part of the Church.
Young Women's Trap
After a young woman is unhappy with the station in Geilenkirchen-Liners, the federal police ask the people for help.
At the beginning of Wednesday morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed out from the railway station building at the end of the railway track and was captured by a freight train that came from Mönchengladbach.
Through the acquisition of the train, the Federal Police carried out its most severe injuries.
It was treated on the spot and was brought to a hospital by rescue forces.
There are no findings on the grounds of the young woman's on-site crossing of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents listening to acoustic perceptions.
There are frequent public transport connections to and from Linderner Railway, clay brick and brick houses, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information on the origin of the accident can be provided at the toll-free hotline at + 0800 / 6888000 or any other police service.
EU Commission is proposing a new court in disputes over TTIP.
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free-trade agreement, TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The disputed private arbitration arrangements for disputes between groups and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that is more traditional in its operation.
"We want to set up a system that the citizens are confident about," said the relevant EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swedish Presidency has proposed the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free-trade talks with the United States.
The German Government announced its support.
The aim of TTIP is to create the world's largest free-trade area with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration procedures show in concrete terms that the EU States and the United States will jointly elect independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come to the same extent from the EU, the USA and from third countries.
Provision is for the first time also a second instance.
It would allow us to object to judgments.
So far, the parties involved have agreed to judge, a possibility against their judgments did not exist.
In the discussion of the past few months, it has become clear that citizens are aware of the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and equity.
In the long term, they want their own data on an international investment court.
Then, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could then be clarified.
The investor-state arbitration proceedings (ISDS) in particular are considered to be one of the main reasons for the strong resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice through which companies can advance compensation at the expense of taxpayers, national laws, or reduce consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organizations, such as Campact, set out the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
Criticism has been drawn up in particular that it will not apply to the negotiated free-trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
The German economic secretary of state Matthias Machnig (SPD), however, has described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission took account of the essential points made by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration will be from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European company association BusinessEurope warned that there were too many new rules to restrict the workings of the economy by means of too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises could be discriminated against in this way.
When the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership can be concluded, it remains unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been underway since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the agreement was supposed to be at the end of this year.
This deadline is no longer tenable.
Violinist Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg, Germany.
Eleven years ago, Catherine Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
In addition, there is a flipchart, at which the shy descendant has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens.
He tells of different places he always draws on the map, which reports its minute-style arranged songs.
Where they were born and what it looks like in his native country.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderful creative madman.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," performed intelligently composed songs, which are harmoniously very close to American folk-late sixties, but may be able to move up in great opulence at any time.
There is the rumor that "Michigan" would be the first part of a failed series: Each of the 50 US states should be followed in succession.
Already in 2004 and in the lower part of the Rhine is already "Seven Swans."
What is more important is the fact that the ball begins here.
Live meet him guitar and banjo.
One year later, the musicians who live in New York return to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), 2005 will be a truly celebrated masterpiece.
Be inspired by ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album rises in the American Billboard charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media.
After a very productive experiment, Stevens worked on "The Age of Adz."
This sixth studio album is still widely orchestrated, but composed of programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and reverberations.
Even the smaller clubs have increased the stage shows here for the colorful spectacle of neon headband and high-fluorescent stage desia.
At the moment it is part of a five-man band from Germany.
On the dark side of the Hamburg more!
Theatre presents the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Even though nearly 2000 guests are now unlocked in their chairs, the triumphant Stevens returns to the intimacy and the folk.
Without having to express a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians is played by the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear that the lecture is "opulent," so you can "throw out" the "plate."
Only to add an add-up may be a modest one, playing acoustically few older songs and then turns out to be at the end of the applause.
Jeremy Corbyns's debut at Question Time of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyns's debut in the Prime Minister's Question Time is eagerly awaited.
The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is supposed to make his debut in Question Time's Question Time and for the first time with David Cameron.
It will be possible for Corbyn to raise the first of his six pre-defined questions soon after midnight, and his performance is likely to be expected by the media and the Labour MEPs.
He called "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Corbyns's leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at Tuc's annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour President, on Tuesday during the passage of the national anthem at a commemorative celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence, has provoked criticism from a number of Tory-MPs and stands at the center of several headline stories in the newspapers.
MR Corbyner's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
A spokesman by Mr Corbyn said that he had 'respected in respectful silence' and he recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air mourning for England."
But a member of Mr Corbyns's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, said in the BBC Two Newsnight programme, he told the Labour President to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyns's top team, and they refer to differences in economics, defense and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported it as a leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political divisions are also stalling within Labour, according to Mr Corbyns' s statement about the European Union's position on the European Union and limits on profits.
Corbyn said the Tuc conference that Labour changes the whole idea of a limit on the whole.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow employment and retirement minister, said that the Party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the cap from 26.000 £23,000.
The British, Corbyn, will be the fifth Labour leader who, since then, has been Tory's leader, over the last decade over the Dispatch box in Parliament.
The Labour Chairman, who promised another type of policy, says that he had "crowd-fed" ideas on questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 ideas.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is a confrontational, and that he does not need "dexterity" and the strings to be avoided and instead focuses on serious problems such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow Minister of Economic Affairs, will be represented by him if he does not attend - for example, if Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also talked about the idea that other Members sometimes take the floor and that John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, has raised the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of "pheasle theatre," which is often linked to Question Time's Question Time, but later he admitted that he failed to do so.
When it was sent on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics argue that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.

Pound rises by accelerating wage growth in the UK
The pound soared to data raising an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom, and the FTSE 100 was also increased by the SABMiller's bid objective.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.9% over the same period last year.
This percentage has been the fastest and measured estimates of interest-rate increases since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and rose to 0.84% against the euro from €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index collapsed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
For the first time, the company was founded in 1994. The company was founded in 1994.
A transaction would combine the world's two largest breweries and combine brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competition for Luxury goods.
Richemonts's latest sales figures show all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are returning to growth.
Shares of Glencore grew by 5% after the mountain bauriese said that it took USD 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of his strategy of reducing the debt.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers in the index, with a fall of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had set out his assessment of the company's rating on "sell."
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports-bearing company had reported an advance tax result of 46.6 million for the six months.
JD Sports's leader says that higher wages endanger the expansion.
JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the potential customers.
But it is unlikely that these purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his firm.
The costs could involve JD Sports's expansion plans, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar, Germany.
Smiling 21 years old, a hanging object with an upper spate.
The type with the platinblon the hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More or less.
At present, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 shoots through.
How Wiktive Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied by Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
However, since 7 o'clock in the morning, the pole is sitting on the cold stone plates of Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The moat building: Here you live their idol, whose posters hang on in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs almost as much as their Mama Ewa earns in half-year-olds.
If ever.
The saying goes: "In fact my Viking had to be in the tenth class in high school."
"I give it a dream."
Compulsory education?
Who is itching?
The fans do not.
Even thrusters themselves do not.
That was a foregone conclusion.
For advertising in the supermarket's roll call, he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-picker company, many dollars in the bending over.
And with every doll, which looks like him and over the shop, bending also wins.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you marvel at the windowpane.
Over 100 million people are expected to reap the rewards.
Some say the hype is going too far.
In the United States and the United Kingdom, others stress that, in the United States and Britain, the new single "What do you mean?"
The first album in November will be followed by the many zeros on the other hand.
At least, it does.
Pegida-posters bring Lebanon to potato döner idea
Potatoes or Döner?
It works both - and that of potato döner, which the Oldenburger snack-maker Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay potatoes and meat put together on a blackboard.
On the idea he brought him a poster for a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of Döner," which he had seen on television.
Since then, in his shop, there has been a barbecue that is equipped with meat and potatoes.
"This is a diamond for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been sent to the German Patent Office in Munich.
It has been protected by information from the Authority for a short period of time.
How much meat and how much potatoes the tables contain, then Alhay does not want to reveal.
Just as much: "It tastes even better," he finds.
Even among its clients, culinary international understanding is a good thing.
Metcash Begins Stand-Up Campaign to Fight Aldi-
Metcash tries to protect IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
In order to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run up to a 700 million dollar invasion, it was launched in order to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media, as well as on events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like iron producers Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes in IGA stores samples and shop owners who sell the approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers.
It is expected that metcash will provide further details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholesale trader for food, alcohol and equipment performs its annual investment strategy.
There is a lot at stake since South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30% of metcashs IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the Eastern countries.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30% in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14% in the eastern states.
However, like Morgan Stanley, analysts believe that, 12 months after the opening of its first markets, around 5% of the food market in these two states will slip away and remove all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
According to this week's report, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose 360 $million per year and Metcash from $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Metcashs's high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash some $13 million profit before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash's market share in the eastern states was lost, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey carried out by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashs's sales in food and food business will decline by 3.8% in 2016 by 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said in a business lunch that metcash will probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Douglass.
However, it was assumed that a board member of Metcash met with Mr Douglass last week.
For 2010, GAS has fallen from 18% to 14%, and revenues from Metcashs's food and food trade, which provides around 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting the reduction in operational deleveraging at the same pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler profits and invests more than $150 million to equalize sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through fast-growing fresh food and delivering a better choice of private label food.
Metcashs's chief executive, Ian Morrice, has said that the price adjustments and charging rehabilitation programs will be renewed and hopes that the wholesale traders will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise as criticism for its behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Mahler and deserves praise, according to the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy, as criticism of his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented Duos, increasingly referred to as "Special Ks," came into the limelight by the infamous clash of Marxgios with Stan Wafalka at the Montreal Masters.
In an entertaining game in late-night, Kokkinakis and his opponent had to be separated by the referee twice by the referee.
While he was last seen how he crushed a tennis racquet, after an explosion destroyed a potential US-Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis's von Healy was steadfastly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth in competing with Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup semi-finals against the United Kingdom.
"One thing about which I am pretty much more concerned is the fact that according to my view Thanasi a little has been drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
He has broken a racquet when he was lost because of an explosion in the US Open, but he is not the first player who has broken a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved very well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances of Harrison and so on, and I think that he deserves much credit.
He has a great team around, he has a great family around, and I think he has been treated somewhat too strictly.
He is a very mature, 19-year-old, he works very hard, he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, he does not have a problem with the other players, he is working hard, he is working hard, he is working hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and sophisticated young guy, he is a very stable and sophisticated young guy, he is a very stable and sophisticated young guy, he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to make Medvedev's decision on the important pre-decision, which begins on Friday, and he describes the 'joint decision' as the right one for all, but it ensures that the man from Canberra, as a long-term fixed component, is "a long-term permanent part of the team."
"First of all, we want the team to be concentrated entirely on competition and not on all the controversy surrounding [Kyrgyzstan]," said Healy.
I think that Nick quickly made the climb, which people like Federer and Murray pointed out, and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, but we try to support him, we try to understand him, we try to understand the consequences of his actions, some time outside the ramp-up, in which he can only think about it, and it is best for the team and it's best for the team and it is best for the team and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares its emergency, closing the border, holding refugees back.
Hungary declares its state of emergency and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all of its attempts to enter the country illegally, with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border, when hundreds of migrants were involved in a no man's land, and Serbian officials were outraged.
The people who had fled from violence were hiding for an unknown period of time in a strip of land between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations rose.
When a police helicopter landed on them, the migrants "open the border" - and shouted insults against the Hungarian on-call police.
Some have returned from protest food and water.
Serbia's Foreign Minister explained that it is' unacceptable 'that migrants from Hungary would be sent back, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border arrived a day after the 28-member bloc did not reach a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that eventually - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would include more 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary, among them.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, was not hoping for an early action from Brussels or from its neighbors.
The emergency emergency was set on Tuesday, in two southern regions, has given authorities greater powers to cope with the crisis, so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Peter Szijjar,, meanwhile said that his country also has the construction of a barbed wire along its border with Romania, to halt the influx of migrants through the country - after leaving a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and has become the gateway to the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that the most incoming economic migrants who are in search of a better life, and not war refugees who have the right to protection, are strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the grace of the 4-metre (13 foot) high fence, which the government built along the southern border with Serbia, a crime.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares the state of emergency," said government spokesmen Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still agree with procedural measures, including the use of the military, which will be expected next week, but reporters of Associated Press have already seen the border with heavy-handed armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Country Security Adviser for Orban, said that there were 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others went deeper into the country.
They come up by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also took two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train trolley with barbed wire to close the borders.
Chaos surrounds the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of humans and put a crowd in pressure in order to get there.
Some 20 were able to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Clinton's lead in Bernie Sanders's lead in national survey was halved.
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to have a double-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her opposite ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47% of the Democratic electorate in the pre-elections (58% before), while Sanders is second, with 27% growth (increased by 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency, receives support from 15% of the presidential elections.
More than five months before the elections began, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their views are fixed, which candidates will support them.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Clinton lost a number of demographic groups since the CBS News poll, while Sanders won some prizes.
Clinton maintains a large lead in women and moderates, but these advances have diminished.
Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders has only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage over 50 years in democratic voters has evaporated, and Sanders are now equal.
However, Clinton still has a large lead in the older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double lead in the liberals, but Sanders now had a 5-point lead in that group.
About half of the country's democratic voters say that they would be happy to support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15% would only support it, because it is the candidate.
Six per cent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it.
Opinions are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about one quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48% of the pre-elections "democratic voters say that they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say this through their top candidates, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's supporters are asked for an open question, why they want the candidate, is the most common response that it has the right experience (16%), followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to be (13%) and that she was the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention their association with Bill Clinton (9%).
Support for dealing with problems and diusability are also quoted.
As the Vice-President has a potential for the presidency, 57% of the preelection's democratic voters want him to see him in the race - though one-third believes that he should not do it.
If democratic voters are asked about the pre-elections, who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is the top.
From Clinton's supporters, more than half are saying that Biden's second choice is far ahead of Sanders.
Choose Biden, not for the nomination of the Democrats, increases Hillary Clinton's lead before Sanders, from 20 points on the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic electorate sees Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning, but this figure fell from 78% over the past month.
Biden is by a different distance a second in this measure, but the percentage that regards him as the "most recognizable," has increased.
However, when it comes to the question of what is more important to a candidate, democratic voters call for questions about eligibility.
Just as last month, no pro-democracy candidate or potential candidate for these voters stands out as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results on certain important characteristics of voters in their party's pre-election.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy, with strong leadership.
Biden scores best with the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is its leadership.
Thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice that many say that of Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion on it.
Democratic voters in the preliminary elections generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic electorate has no opinion of Sanders.
Given that questions related to Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during the term of office as Secretary of State continue to be the Secretary of State, most Democratic voters of the preliminary elections are satisfied with their statement and say that they have not influenced their views as a whole.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with their statement, while only about one third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans have said that the e-mail controversy has no effect on Clinton's general opinions, although 36% said that their opinion has worsened.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of ten who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is regarded as honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, it remains a problem for the voters in its entirety: Only 32% sees it as honest and trustworthy, eight per cent less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62% of the electorate do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of the electorate's electorate sees Trump as unhonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good marks in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson, and Bush are best off.
For a majority, Sanders sees it as honest, but as with Carson, many do not see him.
The error rate for the sampling of 351 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson puts on top of Donald Trump in a country-wide survey.
Ben Carson is in charge of Donald Trump's latest survey of CBS News / New York Times.
The two candidates now account for half of the electorate's support in the new survey, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers, with the support reaching 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month by 27% in the Tuesday's poll.
But Carson soared over the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also revealed that Carson is well received by demographic groups, and is outperforming Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the Ohio Governor John Kasich, is beaten with Wisdom's governor Scott Walker, who was at the deepest level, with 10% support last month and now 2%.
Former governor Yeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, stands at 6% on the third place.
The error margin on the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey, which was published last week, shows that Carson is rising in surveys - it ends up with 19% support from the Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
With regard to last week's rising carson, Trump found some side engravings for the ex-neural surgeons, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Comfortable beach temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in a distance, it is enough for bathers to come to the Mediterranean to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people no longer go into the sea: A maximum of 18 degrees has the same water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD).
Bathing temperatures, however, continue to provide the Mediterranean: The East also has a total of 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic, it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood have been burdened with the death of a barge college newcomer.
It is almost two years, after a student, during a violent ritual ritual as a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, passed away from killing five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Deng during an introductory session in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death.
Officials said that he was burdened with a 30-pound backpack full of sand and was repeatedly attacked, while trying to reach an objective through a frozen field.
Mr Deng complained about headaches, then he was unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911, after Deng was impotent and waited for an hour before leaving him in a hospital, so the police.
However, they had the time to switch from Dengs clothing, to contact his symptoms of goocs and Andy Meng, to contact the national presidents of the Brotherhood to seek advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"On this point, the members began to hide Utensilien and identified the Brotherhood's well-being on that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived and he died the next morning on his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was often treated with blunt force injuries to the head, trunk, and thighs.
"Too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood's harassment, and at least one student dies since 1970 each year," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents the Dengs family.
Wars and their members must be brought to justice, and this step by authorities is very important.
A county Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment of Morder third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of violent attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We do not only want to be responsible for the people involved, but if there is an organisation which - officially or unofficial - sanctioned this, we will also hold them to account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Barge college has banned the Brotherhood, and the national Brotherhood has revoked their belonging to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
An interest rate rises, and the house's fate will fall, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long this will last and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance on the economy.
A recession occurred within only 11 months after the first rate rise, and lasted for 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in responding to the economy and financial assets.
Thus, US officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on raising interest rates, but rather at the time required for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a part.
However, at the end of the day, market participants may say that all the excitement caused by a rate hike may be exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at too low a level to lead to the seismic shock that many people seem to fear.
This does not, however, mean that there will be no impact.
Here a historical trend is based on how some sectors of the economy could respond:
As the market saw last month, the assumption of interest-rate hikes may be volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that assets 12-24 months after the first increase, which may be reflected in monetary policy's delay," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what the Fed is going to do.
More precisely, the market has, in the past 35 years, mostly in an upward trend - around 14% - on the way to increase interest rates, fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6%), then back to 500 days after 500 days, with an average return on the last six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis, the Bob Doll, Chief Building Stratege on Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's published.
Deutsche Bank has said that the impact on shares tends to appear later in the exhaustion cycle and the return is beginning to reduce.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often boost interest-rate hikes.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some of the conditions that it did not exist and that could accelerate recession.
It is remarkable that gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the Fed's rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 1950, the German bank had only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5%.
Although the second quarter 2015 was 3.6%, there are few that will last, and expect only 1.5% for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest-rate hikes in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question of "whether this time is different," said the Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken on a Fed interest rate throughout the year, and all eyes were on the US Federal Open Market Committee's meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading accounts for only 25%.
"Our study carried out all the life cycles of 1950 up to now in a super-cycle with increased momentum in GDP and pre-recession booms very quickly after the onset of recovery," says the report.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipated an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than stocks if they change their strategic trajectory.
On bonds, returns are likely to change direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the harvest cycle, bond yields are falling immediately, "said Deutsche Bank.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise in interest rates will mean that returns between longer and shorter bonds will converge and lead to a reduction in the curve.
High-rise bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still wary of expecting higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst in Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, says Jones, that markets have already adjusted to Fed strategy expectations.
"Next to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the income curve has increased, credit degrees expanded, and volatility has increased - all the features of the market if the Fed intensifies its strategy.
In large and whole, companies that deal with the greater part of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates rise, and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as the financing of their debts.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to respond positively, three months after an initial rate rise," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
With a strong balance sheet, firms with a weak record have averaged 5 percentage points after each in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also accounted for their counterparts with low quality on average each 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will be a major problem.
Firms with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most, said Goldman.
Consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar as a result of their sheer share capital.
Savers could see gains by higher yields, even though experts are of different views about how fast that will take place.

BBC Radio 3 "converts to Classic FM, claims to be a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the station, to prove that he does something that the private channel does not do.
The conservative Member, Mr Bingham, also mentioned the BBC Bossen that the public service radio station "stupid" and increasingly no longer has to be different from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like the word" stupid "- but it seems to turn to Classic FM," he said.
It also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be The Brits only under a different name.
So, if you try to do something different - these are two examples that spontaneously described, in which you actually only imitate what is already on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director-General pointed out the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was well ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I learned from Radio 3 is that I am not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unmatched.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works, I think it was important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work had to be done than it did in the past, because the British were less about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production, which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture, media and sport for the sake of commercial rivals.
Tory member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £.
Are you aware of the fact that this programme is often discussed because it is not original and does not particularly mark the mark?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 Show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced on a special BBC way.
He added that he would like to see the company "hit a hit from our own stall," when the next time he starts a series of entertainment.
However, it refused to exclude the order of other ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose to the slowest in August and the Black Friday may be responsible for this.
In the first three months of 2015, there had been 7% increase in online sales.
Last month it was the lowest ever since the records were recorded in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy shopping.
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slowed down expenditure
For over a decade, virtual shopping has drilled, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online revenue is stagnating, given that new figures showed only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only 5% increase over the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales will stagnate after new numbers show only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015.
"If you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then it has always evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago, when buyers started to make purchases on their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do it in different environments, for example home on the sofa.
But now, and we may well see that growth is decreasing.
The Black-Day phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for falling revenues.
Experts believe that buyers will withhold their purchases from this event, which will take place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers about their computers in order to make their bargains, and some vendor websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers were fighting for bargain goods, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that 5 £was spent on something more than £1.
With some products, such as television sets and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims are buried in Mecca at the Kran accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead will be borne by Muslims during the first burial in Mecca by the streets.
Saudi Arabia is part of the collapse of the huge Saudian Bin Laden Group.
The Ministry of Health has also said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims congregated, when 29 of the victims were borne by the streets in order to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed to Mekkas Großmoschee.
Wealthy filled, largely dressed in white, the track to pay tribute, when the first lost their last trip to the Al-Moigned cemetery.
The grape harvest took place on the Sacred site, where only days was previously a building crat from the mosque and then the king.
The corpses were released for the funeral, when the Saudi King, over the construction company of the Bin Laden family, imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family, who left Bin Laden responsible for the disaster, which left 394 injured.
The corpses of 29 nuns who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Moschee Mekkas were borne by the streets.
Among the deaths was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, the father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage to the Kran.
Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the end of the year.
Saudi officials have already stated that the Haddsch will continue to be a Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman, the bin-loading group, should not have left the trunk of the crane when he was not used.
An Arab version of the decree issued by the Government Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but he said that the management of the company was prohibited.
At the beginning of this week, Salman had promised to reveal, which caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into an inner courtyard of the Great Moschee, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the Haddsch who was subsequently held this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued statements on the collapse of cranes, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also did not engage the group with current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mekkas Großmoschee as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia family for decades and is assuming larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was stolen from his family in 1990's.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom for the pilgrim journey that was necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials agreed that 1 Million Rial (£174,000) should be paid to the relatives of the displaced persons and the same amount was permanently injured.
Others have received half of that amount.
B & Q Boss says that the time of the cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over.
British people increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased.
This leads to the opening of 200 more screwfix shops that are aimed at craftsmen.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide.
From Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It claims that Britons are laying down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes.
If you sent with a hammer or a brush to remove walls, you seem to be a minority now.
For Britons are increasingly practising craftsmen to carry home jobs in their houses, so the head of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, a new manager of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, has said that a large rise in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has been overtaken by low-price services.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more screwfix shops, which are directed to artisans and to close 60 points of sale B & Q.
Mrs Laury said that she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions were taken by women.
At the present time, the men are very much at the mercy of the men.
She said that it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more women single households than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: 'There is still a majority of men in our stores.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are 80% of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the head of a UK in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has just 50% of the team occupied with women, including its management and financial director.
Mrs Laury said: 'This was a conscious choice - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in the half-year profit and the turnover after the group taught the costs of closing the stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, Screwfix and B & Q have 200 new branches.
Civil servants of Aich / Dob due to the fact that they are unloyal to the courts.
At the Regional Court Klagenfurt, on Wednesday, two of the two officials of the Austrian Volleyball-Vice-Chair Aich / Dob will have to be responsible for unfaithful and out-of-home education.
The accused were not guilty of that.
One of them was also accused of abuse of power.
He was acquitted of this charge in May.
The current process has been deferred.
According to Supreme Attorney-General Robert Rihn, the preliminary study showed that the defaulting in the years 2006-2011 used funds from club accounts, on which they were allowed in their functions, for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sport officials are also indicted for financial offences.
This fact left the head of the Schopenensenats, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
For the sake of imfidelity, the defence was that the association was not born at any time.
The sports officials would only have charged allowances and the sports club, for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011, and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of their debts - the passva in 2001 was about 600 000 Schilling (roughly 44.000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: Would we continue or lock the club," said one of the accused, in the bread profession of large-scale operational auditors of the financial office.
With his colleague and co-accused he then decided to take over this task.
With all risks.
"We have made money to advance our life assurance as security at the bank," he said.
The association had been agreed: You can freely manage the money, it must not be a debt.
Furthermore, with the appropriate financial compensation, the payment of compensation allowances had been decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, a portion of the allowances were paid only years later, namely from the year 2003, when a plus was made on the bank account.
As a result, the former Obmann also appeared on the basis of flat-rate and non-detail cancellations.
The accounts and the savings books administered the two defendants jointly, the second accused.
If the payouts were not disclosed in detail, the judge asked.
The association has not been interested in the detail of financial management, important to be just debt relief, so the answer.
When, in 2011, an official investigation of abuses began, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the club's account.
They had been back, declared the accused.
This securities account expired on the names of the second accused and was not known, according to the association.
"Why?" The judge wanted to know.
For a long time, the survey knew nothing about it.
He later said that he thought that this was the best thing for the club.
If it had happened something would not have known anything from that money, the prosecutor was in the room.
The co-imposed claim had been justified, justified by the function.
This transfer has been made as "damage recovery."
Bad luck and public prosecutor wanted to know how to deal with it.
The first accused, the first defendant, did not agree with this wording, because the club had never been damaged.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, 'You are all out of the Schneider'.
'am I a legal representative? 'He asked.
Furthermore, the function has said that he has never paid a cent salary; he only has a mileage allowance and allowances.
In such cases he has taken into account the club 1,000 euros a month, but the actual amount was much higher, but he added.
Exact documents for the early years have not been able to show the accused.
They were not preserved after an operating test, in which everything was properly assessed.
The second accused was also referred to as the second defendant.
He said, "he said," he said, "he said," he said, "he said," he said, "he said.
The main negotiation will continue on September 23 with the interrogation of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard employs more than 30,000 jobs.
In addition to the loss of personnel for three years, the computer giant will have to reduce further jobs in connection with the division of the company.
The recruitment of the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
The US-technology group, in its restructuring, is planning to reduce the number of 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer base.
As a result, costs amounting to EUR 2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion) will be saved on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special charge of around $2.7 billion that will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The loss of 55,000 jobs over three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of fiscal 2013 / 14, HP still employed around 302,000 employees.
On the other hand, the Hewlett-Packard share was 2.3%.
Now, with printers, the Group from California Palo Alto is now on board: In this way, the computer and printer business will be bundled again this year in a new society - separated from the more promising areas of computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business areas should be noted on the stock exchange.
Another disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand for company customers after its services were the world's second-largest PC manufacturer.
In the third quarter at the end of July, the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.5%.
Sales fell by 8 percent to a mere $25.4 billion.
As a result, the proceeds went back to 15 quarters of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and a massive set of jobs in the industry.
The 76-year old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only recently responded to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smart phones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more business on-line.
Whitman's restructuring plans, in general, represent a reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority support the anti-IS education mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in hostilities in Iraq would, however, be overwhelmingly opposed to rejection: 54% said that 35% were favourable.
The fact that other states are flying against the IS in Iraq and in Syria is 61% positive.
24% are against interfering with the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian leader, Baschar al-Assad, accounts for 51% of those questioned, 20% of whom would be in favour.
29 per cent did not decide.
Cars: Second Press Day on the 66th IAA
The exhibition grounds will be networked, self-sustaining cars and electric mobility for 27 September.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the "Mobility" theme on Thursday.
The wide audience can attend the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA are expected to receive around 900 000 visitors two years ago.
Röszke: Violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police force attacked several hundred refugees on the Serbian border in Röszke Temmengas.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind him, a police line was formed, and the police were prepared to guard against the police.
40 to 50 refugees began with stones, sticks, and plastic bottles according to civil servants.
First of all, the civil servants set out ever-increasing pepper spray.
Then the police used tear gas.
Much Temmengas has been floated in the direction of the refugees.
In that way, the group was dissolved.
The refugees have withdrawn somewhat now.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was worn out of the zone.
Children, who had inhaled the tear gas, shouted.
Other refugees blew together and suffered breathing.
Also the press reviews of the Serbian police suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the US Federal Reserve meeting on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the important decision whether, for the first time in almost a decade, interest rates are rising or not.
A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half that the Fed thought was a little more than half that the Fed would now think that the Fed will stay a little longer, raising interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25%.
It is a historical event because it has been seven years since the Fed has applied interest rates on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero range and launch a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Leidiger employee at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively high-performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook in global terms.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday on Thursday.
Death Guard at Delta State University left debt forgiveness!
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleague later on day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "tired" when he was "tired" when he was "sorry," at the first murder and wanted to show "he could do the same thing," announced authorities on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the emergency call number against 10: 00 am on Monday morning.
And said, he had shot on someone and killed someone.
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that police officers had to be sent to their homes.
He said, 'I raised my wife last night' and he also mentioned that a 'sweet dog' is a 'sweet dog' in the house, but 'no one will bother you' but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller on his behalf, but he did not give him.
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots.
As police the scene entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a hand written note of Lamb, 45, saying: "I am sorry, I wanted to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me. "
After writing the note, Lamb took 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as police officers.
University's president, William LaForge, said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb supposedly thought that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, said authorities on Tuesday that there was no information, no evidence, "for a" triangular relationship. "
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that she was about seven years old as a "good man."
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they were friends.
O'Steen said, he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and she was "on the ground."
He said that Prentiss were their daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked on-line from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog called lightning, met with Lamb for about three years.
"She wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said, lamb had called on a particular time on Monday to tell them "he will not go to jail."
When police took him on highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled to foot, ran out in the woods, and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb was given a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 on his life-style status on the university's website.
Stars that lost their fortune-makers
The actor (on the left), in the image with his son Redmond (on the right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor has reportedly struggled to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug ownership.
All this certainly demands its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa builds the Group around the world.
The Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring.
A half billion euro a year does not want to save the Lufthansa Group with a better organisation.
150 of the world's around 1000 executives will have to pay for the job costs.
The pilot unions, however, have new negotiations.
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evaluates the low-cost Eurowings.
The target of rebalancing is a earnings contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from costs and recoveries, divided the airline on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger business.
The low-cost air carrier Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In future Karl Ulrich Garnstadt will be responsible for Eurowings.
With the new creation, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, which the Group intends to take in future against Ryanair and Easyjet.
To date, the organisation of the 120 000 employees of a strong company has been complex.
The airlines were operating under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, representing the three-quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the event of a dispute with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations will be resumed after the judicial strike this Thursday.
That was what the trade union said.
The subject of the talks is intended to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
In a year with a predicted record result, "the" want to "be expected to produce solid results as quickly as possible.
The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
The background, along with the transitional supply of pilots, is the austerity concept 'Wings'.
It provides the Lufthansa in the fight against competitors routes to the Group's own low-cost line Eurowings.
The paintings by Leena Krüger can be seen in the artist's house under the title "Morgenzug in the South."
For a long time in Göttingen, Finnish, in the White Room of the House, there was a selection of tabloid works that animate their viewers in order to go on tour.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United may not play for months on double fractures.
At PSV Eindhoven's Champions League defeat, Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right arm.
While this has led to the left wing of the outside world and excluding him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give the hope that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
The violation was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw in the PSV area had collapsed.
He was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
It will be moved tomorrow or may be a day later and will then be operated in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it is very difficult and is really fantastic, and that will happen.
In the dressing rooms he had an oxygen mask on it.
He weaned.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double tariff, it takes the six months and it will not play in the group phase.
I hope that he can play this season again.
It seemed to be more than happy to escape a red card and the imposition of an Elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish Mexicans.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an Elfmeter and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack on both legs.
A tweet on Shaws's account was: "Thank you all for your messages.
In this respect, Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw at the PSV defeat.
The UK defender, with the Euro-European European Cup, has an additional incentive to recover from the coming June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It is a very serious infringement."
When a player leaves space with this kind of injury, all of them are very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to violate an opponent.
The Dutch team played a part in the collapse of Mexico against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and then you hear that there is a very serious injury, this is not good," said Cocu.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was moving in a different direction, so that it looked like he had touched him [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In the interview with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I am very sorry, but I am sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado has also been brought to hospital - after a Foulplay by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing all parents will learn soon: If your child loves a book it will not take a long time to know.
Unless you are, perhaps, David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems, to call his favorite child book, the Prime Minister decided for the Lorax, the environmental fabel of Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the site of SuperCamp, and continues: "Funny, moving, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I am happy to read from my children, because there seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed."
All fine, except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the act of the book describes instead a summary of the 2012 version of 2012, adding new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by reading his desire to see a real tree," his desire to see a real tree, "he reads.
As if it were not yet suspicious enough: The Cameron-made text reads in part like the summary of the Lorax movie that is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams".
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book.
Most of the time, such a relatively low PR job has been delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokesman said that the text probably came from Cameron's electoral district office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron's staff was delivered but did not give any more immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England's crew, but it is still hard to see.
There is a difficult task on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, but if you see the Kader, who chose the United Kingdom for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat will not be on my card.
I would not exclude an election victory.
Alastair Cooks page is perhaps less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting setting, and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear scars in 2012, only a positive attitude.
The ball develops Moeen Ali as Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even when it is an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth leaves from the England test shield and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to let Adam Lyth be hard to analyze, of course, as his chief trainer in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are targeted at results.
There was no question mark on Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - as I said earlier - players are their own best choice.
A long time ago, the run of Lyth had been extended, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he hopefully gets more out from Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even though he did not perform such good performances, and this does not surprise me; he is, above all, a team man.
The question of how much time a test is received to put its mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him -, while Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton won the chance to play live and play.
The only accusation that can be made was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was at its peak - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a drummer who I highly appreciate.
He is an X-factor player, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge Square, which was a great experience for us.
It must have at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but that, of course, depends on the team setting in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to make Moeen next to Cook, making an extra spin Bowler and receiving four quicks appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a drummer could not beat there, and it has already shown that he is a vicious circle of cricket players.
Moeen may have not completed his job for his district Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
My former team member, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test at the first drop before he first appeared in 2001.
He took over three hundred meters and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the Kader as a back-up spinner, and in my limited handling of him he has impressed me as a young man.
People may be looking at his statistics - an average of 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there are no large numbers of backup spies that make their hands up and the coaches have chosen for young people.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the trainer.
The nomination of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the most nettable guys of the game, who will have a wealth of experience, as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood stands for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and power to the setup.
I always felt it was created for international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes, new voices may be fresh in the changing rooms, even if the messages are in line with what was previously said.
Collys team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayer, the root of the root has a similar break from Australia and I don't have a problem with it.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team leaders do not determine the timetable.
And you must remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions will not be taken lightly.
The Brexit Storage Office (Brexit = Exit Britain from the EU) could gain access if the economy in 2017 is falling into a bust.
David Cameron's bottomless renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with each day, even without the election of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or no?" "Corbyn as leader of Labour or the Tuc, who shook the way for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat has recently told me that some member states are so deeply enmeshed in various crises, as the EU is now, and not always on their own, that Britain's own agenda with split concessions and disturbing treaty changes, which they do not want in most cases, are tired.
In Brighton, the Tuc decided, at its annual meeting, that it did not like it, if it jeopardized social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie's agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a photo of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, come home and say that they win allies for reform.
It is always a matter of me.
My European friend, who wants an outside Britain inside the EU tent, says "Lass us not alone with France," says Berlin - and it shows that more and more short-sighted ministers and civil servants in some of the capitals have reached the point where they do not matter whether or not we remain or go.
Germany's carefully thought-up Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14), and Kohl (16).
France François Hollande looks back on his re-election or replacement in 2017.
It is also a divisive force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain left a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will tear themselves out of a leg to help the Selfie-Britons whose energy should be better used to prevent Scottish exit from the UK - something they do not want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
As a result, some of these ministers may even consider unuseful comments, in the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexite process seems to suspect my friend.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "the United Kingdom has won nothing out of the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be its expense, and what EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the Pressebarone, as it did during Tony Benn's inspired referendum in 1975, but did not support us in 1973 with a 2-1 ratio.
They may be wary of Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro opportunists, who made a name as a "EU-Russia-US correspondent in the early 90" s.
In all its deceit, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These include the Medley from tax-loving villains, telephone hushers and the pseudo non-native people who have the majority of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought it similar, but found that if you were sitting in a cage with a hot Gorilla, you were better distributing bananas to divert him rather than his lunch and dinner.
Indeed, it was a militia of more Blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair had the principle of the unadopted constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened it by a back door.
The press has never been able to do so.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly cock on the back on Monday in Westminster - I said to him that he did not need to waste time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnocks boycott Murdoch's strategy of 80 years, a mistake at that time and today.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC has left on Sunday.
Corbyns official position on Europe is - I speak it friendly - in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukips of traditional Blaufarbstoff tendency and the willingness of Torys of small-country poverty can say yes to everyone.
It is what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on radio and television this week, said when the Scouts struggled in him, not to admit that Corbyner's appointment of a provocative John McDonnell was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70-th years, when his old father was on television trying to be unloyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilarys's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "in all circumstances" - Benns's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his followers and members after all the reports on Monday evening.
Whatever the bad bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - the news discipline remains important in the age of television around the clock and, above all, in the Strudel of the Social Media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is true that Cameron does not have a free ticket for Europe to allow his support in the referendum campaign to be taken for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns basic ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite knowledge economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguity about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not launch a campaign for exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try and find a sense for their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if it is pointless to do so?
The US is already rather disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even with the Tory government's cost-cutting approach, which was reminiscent of British influenza Security Forum early on Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Claims made by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was born out of a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined the Lancet by criticising Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Principles Report" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the resilience of data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A temporary article in the pharma medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy base," which was based on the PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers wrote in BMJ and asked whether the allegations were based on rock or sand.
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: 'A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy'.
You said that the public expects the assertion of PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking 'on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple decision-making analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Document - MCDA), in order to establish their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose directors were supposed to have received previously from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also wrote the references from BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting declared that it would be possible to obtain funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but did not add the funds that he should have received previously from Philip Morris International, the tobacco company.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the body are not supplied, but these include several known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The tobacco management of PHE also took part.
The group's research shows that there is a shortage of "hard evidence for the losses of most products in the most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the allegations of PHE that "there has never been evidence that e-cigarettes were" premature to smoke for children or non-smokers. "
Prof Kevin Fenton, director for health and wellbeing at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ have already been answered previously.
He said: 'E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking'.
Every second lifetime smoker dies on his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison but that we continue to study the long-term implications.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what has been shown and what does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in relation to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease with regard to smoking, and smoking kills the national health system for two billion pounds a year.
By clearly setting up current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are meeting our national competence.
BBC should give up Eastenders, says former boss of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like Eastenders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK stations.
He criticized the BBC for using public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, to place against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried six years on channel 4 without success trying to contact the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent, which would also be clearly demonstrated by non-subsidised rivals," Johnson said to the Oberhaus communication committee in the context of its study of the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I think is not a good idea in the medium or long term, should its production be at least on programmes that others do not do or require.
They send The Voice in a prime time window, because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax programme is financed, which could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, Eastenders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm.
I am trying to see how this should be public service television.
I do not think that this would reduce the BBC altogether.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who headed the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC's guilt is due to the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support. "
His comments on the most popular broadcasts from the BBC give again what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows how Eastenders should sell.
Johnson said that the rather public-legal niche applications should go to BBC4, where the public cannot measure the audience, but they perform their duties, and they can argue that if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion £radio fees, 'Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen'.
They put them into a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them.
In charge of broadcasting, Johnson said to the committee: 'I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions, who can receive the best value from it.
Of course, all of us think that we all think that you pay a great deal of money for 150 pounds a year, but for those who have a lot of money for the 150 £, I wonder whether this is true, because they do not consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky- and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also said before the Committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to verify its Reithian Mission, "to inform, educate, and entertain."
He said that only the BBC production was officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on radio - and it should be able to inform, educate and entertain in public television stations in Australia and Canada.
On the question of partnerships, Elstein, the BBC was supposed to do more in areas such as that of the pros, of whom he said that only a handful of people will be shown on television and talk to the commercial channels in order to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves.
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms from genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by waves of sound waves.
The tiny nematoons change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses that have high frequencies for human hearing.
The impulses are based on the activation of Motoneuron cells, which are genetically modified to support the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Further to this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new method called Sonogenetics, which can be used for ultrasound to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Haekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depths brain stimulation, an invasive procedure involving the electric impulse in the brain of humans to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fissors generally do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, found out, amplify the ultrasound waves that then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves affect structures that are called TRP-4-ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the pulp cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these axes channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, such as Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-guided nematodes, Chalasani modified genetically worms so that some of their Motoneurons support TRP-4-ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to changing creatures, the sound waves will be amplified and transmitted over to the worms, where they turn on to the changed Motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a ground-breaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurones on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light emitted from an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves may pass through and may be sent to the skull at the top of the brain.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible that the intended human neurons are temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications may focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, adding them.
Illegal torture equipment - right in front of your doorstep!

Amnesty International Anti-Arms Exhibitions-Video watch.
Terrible killer drones!
You can choose from a wide range of balls!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shocks that cause painful pain, but do not leave a trace!
The happy voice and the cartoon images make it clear that this display for the world's largest arms trade is a militant parody of which Amnesty International has produced, in order to get the British Government's willingness to expose weapons to oppressive regimes on Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to lots of posters, which can be seen on bus stops and underground trains, which require a second glance.
"Important announcement: From 15th to 18th September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) read in the font types of the London Underground and the brands of the DLR line, which turns to the image of a tank.
In September there will be a blink of arms dealers with DLR... customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum for cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped the distribution in London and used the "Ad Space Hack Packs," a 6 £-pack of charges that claim that "access to about one-third of the bus stops advertising space on the planet" was claimed.
Transport for London is not fun to find this placid "vandalism."
One of the parody advertisements made by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists engage with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go out to the real world to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms advertising posters greet the pendulum in the underground.
The Amnesty-Video has been seen more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was developed by the advertising agency VCCP, who works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist who works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that reigned around the campaign for the weapons trade - through an exile of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising, but "by replacing them with bright colors and animation, it remains stronger."
"You have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices on the exhibition," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area of ExCeL, where exhibitors fantastic euphemistic products.

Eight golden rules governing life in student residences
Eleven years ago, I moved into a student residence for weeks ago, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smile of those I felt - and the many, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes ranges from easy-to-read, up-to-earth, to a very frightening one.
It is tempting to shout: People tell about where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you are on Corbyn, and why, frankly, you do not love to love or hate Marmite, because in seriousness, boys, it's just a yeast extract hahaha, I'm in my room. "
Breathe in.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you to find the people you like in contrast to those you would not like to talk about, even if your eyes were on fire and these fire extinguishers were.
Let people.
The rooms of people are often transformed into drinks, film-night venues and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people wear and wear underwear.
Related to this: Do not think that you start a relationship at the university.
Introspection received a rough treatment at the University.
Your room should be a hideaway, but many student homes form a space-to-space-stroll culture, which is friendly and socially responsible and capable of life-long friendship.
This can be the hell for someone who tries to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say: 'I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to work with you'.
Try to feel when a commilitone is exhausted and send you an SMS message.
Speaking of propos: Do it.
A Kerl in my student living quarters had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship is close by baking.
As you start the university at the height of the back-mania, it is the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of brownies, less weird than the welcoming of the 1950-er years, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have something to tell you, so please smile when I ask you a couple of personal questions."
Making sweets is a good way of closing friendships.
Their loved ones feel obliged to be entertained and may at the end associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Low-missing clumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you turn on.
Eating to steal is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, the claws of chicken are a theft, but is it a drop of nuts for your tea?
Check it with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that they say that they themselves use themselves even when they cook.
If someone steals your things, it is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to treat them more balanced than my co-worker who added their milk to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
They should not make noise from sleep or work.
It is not just a question of being a decent man, but that you are literally the people who sit in the glass building.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbours whether she had something to make a drum and bass a little bit quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even more vocal music.
Finally, when she left at 5 o'clock, she loved to sleep her neighbors for two hours before leaving her own music, her doors closed her doors and came to her three-hour review.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse was random to attend the same student residence?
Conversely, it would not be abominable if you were a co-resident for your future spouses, to take care of them and to see them again, and perhaps to see all the shared friends coming from?
Of course, the heart goes to its own ways - but if a good friend is definitely not your future spouse, try to make sense.
At the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his key in his non-locked room, the boundary between an ulcer and bullying is more fine than it seems.
A good stone is fun, but it takes only moments until it becomes boomerang.
Give yourself a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but don't see anyone else's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Shut your door, and put your keys to a glass of water, which will then be placed into the freezer - but instead, you will no longer see your possessions on the ceiling.
Terraced houses for refugees, single-parent couples, low-wage earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds houses for people who do not have much money in the middle-eastern corner of the corner valley.
Thus, for refugees, for example, they also send out as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the mother and the low earners'.
"I show you how to build even more cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees are being pushed into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how to create low-cost living space as quickly as possible: In a project building series houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pressing for the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or fitrooms has no sustainability.
For the people are staying to a large part here.
In the face of the influx of refugees, we need to have enough housing in the decades to come.
A completely banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least room.
It facilitates integration.
This is different if people are undercut in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses, which are being built in the pilot project, consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say that it is again peace, I go back.
Then the houses can be easily converted according to their needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square meters per house amounts to 184 000 euros, without land.
That is manageable.
Six months has taken the construction stage.
That is appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated its plans?
Gildner: I decided to correct my project correctly.
It is particularly complicated that it always makes it possible to have the effect of a special structure and the central location regulation.
Gruselig.
It is still a matter of who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three parking spaces.
It is only in the cities that there is no room for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did residents of the population respond to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury housing for asylum seekers.
What is definitely not right.
But do you not tighten the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True, we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years, but they were built in luxury housing, which can hardly afford any more.
My project has the message, even the ordinary people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also single mothers or the low-wage earners.
I show you how you can build even more cheaply and well today.
That is what it is all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially studied environmental analysis.
Ios 9: How to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
The new operating system can be requested by entering the configuration app, then type in "General," and then select "Software Update."
If it's ready, you have the option to download it and then install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation because it receives an error message that informs that the "Software Update failed."
To avoid the problem, users are advised to wait until the rush goes back or try to update iTunes.
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process.
This could potentially cause the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it less likely due to the updating of the updates, and it will be easier to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re-install them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is near a charging unit, so that the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may be switched off half-way and this could lead to a failure of the update.
Read: Ios 9 release still in the schedule despite the WatchOS delay in the review of iOS 9: The least exciting, but the latest update of iOS 9: How to prepare for the new iPhone operating system.
You should also ensure that you have seen your check list of all things right before your download, to prevent it from getting wrong and protecting it if it does. IOS 9 brings new features, including a much more intelligent personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that will speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg recognizes in the battle for the World Championship title in Formula 1's Formula One series against his clearly leading Mercedes team, Lewis Hamilton, just a slogan: "Full attack."
The World Cup second emphasized before the launch in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I had nothing more to lose."
53 points separate the vice-champion of Singapore on this Sunday's title defender and Zweiter-Champion Hamilton.
The Briton won seven of the previous twelve seasonal races and has won the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as the favorite.
2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brite could win the race.
It is still unclear whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on the Great Price of Singapore.
For days, there has been a dark storm over the city, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member.
The chess club "Chess Friends Bad Kissingen" took place three months ago, and the number of players increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who took over for 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the cure.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the Federal Ministry of Finance and Tourism (1st class) and honorary citizens of the cities Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation, the Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wants membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the Tennis Club "Red-White" as an expression of its attachment to the spa town.

Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift are joined together under the cover of the Social Foundation and a new branch office is opened on the Count Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to advice, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre.
More specifically, the count Stauffenberg-Platz.
Recently, a new neighborhood office has been opened.
In addition to the shopping market, right beside the shopping market, you will receive information on issues such as health insurance and health care services.
For years, we have established with our outpatient care service that often caring members are left alone.
There are an infinite number of questions.
"Also, often many of the benefits of the funds are not used, because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood," said the new prefect in Jutta Weigand, who was also responsible for the protection of the citizens of Jutta Weigand, who was also responsible for the civil hospital and for the ambulance service "Amadeus."
In addition to the consultation, the new neighbourhood office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
In order to do this, the Saludis has been taken on board.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training, or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The services offered by the parent center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The senior center for care and care," described Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre makes both managers particularly aware of demographic changes.
Because it requires a good, decentralized infrastructure in the individual cities of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized in the opening ceremony that the neighborhood office also dedicates itself to the association's association: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite you to a regular sociable one."
In doing so, the Social Foundation has a major role to play in ensuring that the elderly can live as independently as possible and in their familiar environment.
The travel office office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9: 00 to 14: 00, Tuesday and Thursday from 16: 00 to 18: 00 and on Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm.
Eintracht Bamberg gegen Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it's official: After renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third party of Würzburger Kickers has not yet been settled, it was decided on 6 October.
The match of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian football totopokals against the third party FC Würzburger Kickers has now been definitively terminated.
It will be held on Tuesday, October 6th, at 19 o'clock in the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game will take place over the stage, we now have planning security," says FCE-Teammanager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points out the sale of the ticket.
It is for our team something special to play against a third party.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and this is not without reason, since flood lights have a special charm.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg won the first FC Oberhaid (3: 1) and at home against the regional ligists 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3: 2).
The winners of the competition will receive 5,000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Spokthan 2016 / 2017.

Vienna architect Karl Mang 92-years deceased.
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of the Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92 years, like the artist's house on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses an honorary member and, at the same time, one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna, as stated in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna, he studied painting during and after the Second World War Architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952, he has been working as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and faculty director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 80s, he was assigned to the Austrian Theatre Museum with the establishment of the treasury at the Vienna Imperial Palace and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz.
Parking penalty: Tim meadow grabbed police with money
Ex-footballer Tim meadow has noticed in Bremen.
Just before the end of the year, there was a lot of fun and a lot of fun.
According to his own statement, 30 kg of muscle mass would have been possible over the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he was not allowed to do so.
In the city of Bremen, it was possible to cut his hair when he saw that a parking space guard, a parking space guard, had issued a penalty for his white Toyota Camaro.
At the end of the day, there was a lot of noise coming from the shop, and threw her the official fine before the feet, as the "picture" newspaper reported.
At the city of Bremen, the allegations are confirmed, the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet known.
"The thing is still in the test," it says from the city Bremen.
Only then will be determined whether meadow will be displayed, or not.

Do 17-year-old Afghans chew a beating on 17-year-old Afghans.
On Friday evening, at 11: 45 p.m., the police took care of an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster. Three young men were on foot from Bad Soden towards Salmünster on Friday night.
One from the group, a 17-year old Afghan, followed the police according to his two friends in a distance of about five meters, telling them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft gas station.
There were also three people in the field of the gas station.
One of these men now shuts up the young people and beat them into the face.
The victim suffered a nose breakdown and blood from the nose.
When his two friends rushed and appeased on the racquet, his / her victim left him first.
From his friends, the last young man was brought home.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car up to their home and spent several times on several occasions.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured was in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked by the racquet and another male person.
Under the aid of a checkpoint, it was examined on the face and the upper legs of the victim.
The victim had to be brought to hospital for medical care.
So far, there has been a vague interpretation.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racquet was supposed to be about 1.65 metres tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and pointers to report on the phone number 06181 / 100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller assumes practice and invests 310,000 Euro.
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice from Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felsenausen.
It is also a great pleasure to be part of Bernd Bormann, an economic management company Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country there are no doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes the practice on 1 October.
While Ursel Hospital is retiring for retirement, the man Karl-Heinrich will continue his successor in half the place in the months to come.
After a reconstruction phase, Muller Martini opened its practice on 12 October, until then, until then, the company was investing 310,000 euros in the premises at St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathetically at first sight, when Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, were familiar with the themes of Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who at the present time completed their medical training in the hospital hospital and also wants to come into practice on a later date.
"We had always borne in mind that the waste bins would be well suited to this practice," says Dr. Ursel Feldenausen and laughs.
"When it was so, I just called it '.
The couple, Mrs Müller, liked the idea to use their own practice in future in Asendorf.
"The proximity and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and support the families over the years."
As an advantage he also sees his own boss soon.
And that is how it was agreed that the waste makers bought the house with practice.
At the same time, however, they will continue to be in breakage-Vilsen.
There, the two-fold family father Frank Müller grew up, his medizinstudium in Hannover followed stations in several doctors' practices and in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
At present he works as a doctor in Sulingen and has been appointed to the leading forensic specialist in the field of Diepholz in 2009.
From 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
During the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Feldenausen works as a house doctor, his wife Ursel specializes in gastroenterology.
The waste makers, both intermediaries, want to establish themselves as veterinarians.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic examinations and long-term and load control EKGS as well as a speaker room.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
A grant of a total of €50000 will receive the waste from the region (€25000) and from the community (12500 euros) and the municipality (EUR 12500).
"This shows how proud and glad we are that the practice is continuing," said tribute to Bernd Bormann.
About 2000 patients, according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, come into practice for each quarter of each quarter, and in the North German average practice it is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another house doctor practice.
A positive side effect on Frank Müller's practical assumption: The pharmacy will remain in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felsenausen.
If no successor had found, it would have gone.
For example, if you visit our office hours, you will be able to find out more in familiar faces: The seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the field.
Their departure ends in an era in Asendorf, after all, after 30 years, the doctor practiced there.
"At the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel Felsenausen remembers.
It is a bit of mourning that she felt after a long time.
"But we are still living in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients," says the boarding house.
Your husband adds to laughter: 'We have a 6000-square meter'.
"So far, I have always pressed for the work of gardening.
In addition, the couple has two grandsons and will be happy to travel.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees through"
"Now the border controls are also high on our southern border," said Internal Minister Johanna Mikl Leitner.
Controls on the Hungarian border are maintained at the same time.
After all, it is clear that everyone who wants to apply for asylum can also take this' out of course '.
The supply and safety of the people are at the forefront.
It should be clear, though, that it needs clear signals, "said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, even in the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering "corridor" - Slovenia refused.
The Croatian Government had previously indicated that it would also allow Slovenia to move forward refugees towards Austria and Germany and, under certain circumstances, also create corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not the case with Home Affairs Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors would be 'absolutely unacceptable', but Slovenia would intensify the surveillance of the border - particularly in Hungary.
The border with Croatia is already heavily controlled, however, as the external border of the Schengen Area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenia does not want to freeze its borders on refugees.
"Each EU member must complete its obligations, otherwise the system will not work," said Györkös Znidar.
Like the Croatian Government, the first refugees had already tried in East Crobs at the Tovarnik / sid border crossing to avoid registration.
The Croatian police could take them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to the local media, police vehicles have been constantly meeting with new refugees since then in the Croatian Tovarnik.
They are predominantly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the next few days, his country with around 4000 refugees is expected to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, diverted towards Croatia, were unanimous in meeting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was, the people required to take certain routes: "Neither can we nor do we want to do so," he said.
According to the media reports, at least in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived at the border city of sid in the Serbian border city, were expected further buses during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates were the night of the Macedonian border of Serbia, which was around 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has admitted, so the police have told us that we are going to travel here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could well lead to an already predicted shift in the previous Balkan Route of Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a somewhat farther west route.
Croatia: 'Comprehensive cross-border controls'
Spain's Minister for Home Affairs, Ostojic, had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for exceptional situations in the case of a large influx of refugees.
He did not mention it, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has' extensive potential for border control '.
You have strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, the EU partners have been providing good proof of the standard of border controls since 2007.
On the Serbian side, there are some 300 refugees remaining behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at Mount Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the refugees who are going to continue to travel on the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Nebojsa Stefanovic, tried to reassure Wednesday morning at a local eyewitness in Horgos: He thought that the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, are premature.
It would not be a case of very high numbers of refugees.
They could not say whether they would continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Aid from migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes are known by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: In parts of the border, there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian occupation.
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mines had been sent to the border region.
Exchange hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million dollars.
Supranonok is supposed to have been part of a ring of cybercriminal who has been accused since 2010 for ever to gain insight into unreleased financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire.
Hidden information should be an insider's business in the financial markets.
In that way, according to research experts, over 100 million dollars were put in place.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are finally caught up."
The processes against 32 other accused were in the case.
Most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospizool Mannheim has been in business for 20 years.
There is a great deal of activity around the Mannheim-Centrum.
People are doing their worries, sometimes quick steps, partly relaxing.
You will be guided by the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalons.
Roads in the streets.
Pulsating, pralles life on the splendid autumn sun pass and in the end of four large panels each with the heading "Before I would be tame".... "
The Ecumenical Hospemination Fund drew attention to its 20-year anniversary with this measure, and has met with mixed reactions.
"It is about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and the people," Josefine Lammer says.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospizet will also be available for questions and discussions at the same time as the volunteers.
While some have a fit spontaneously, and the sentence "my life affirmative," "reading," "with the camper by the United States," "the war is stopped" or "not long-suffering," say sets like "so far I am not yet" and then go on.
Again and again, there are little discussions about the action itself on the sidelines, about life, the way in which they are dying.
Peter Hübinger is also present on site.
"Only if I realize that eventually will come to the end of this world, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonic plant in Mannheim, which, together with the Caritsk Association, is responsible for the Ecumenical Hospital Association.
Therefore, this high-profile action for the age of 20 is good.
The fact that not everyone has wanted to communicate publicly on the tables is understandable, after all, after all, it is a very personal issue.
The subject of death and dying is still taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospital movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people are opening up.
A statement that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and funeral is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
By personal experience of the subject, they had a lot of literature and decided to commit themselves to euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospemination received honorary official call, they immediately registered and were involved in the year 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - those affected and in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and in Hospiz St Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can do well with her task and experience and experience.
"I see life from another planet, it seems to be precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of outpatient Ecumenical Hospital is free of charge and denominational.
Financial support for public health insurance funds and donations from family members and associations provides the training and training and superiors of the victims' families.
Every two years training courses for new employees are offered.
The panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the Church of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There you will also find additional personal requests on postcards.
FedEx's outcome mixed, financial prospects for 2016 reduced
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the ramp-gigant has reduced his win-win over a year on the basis of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its naval service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for their holidays.
At that time last year FedEx announced that the company would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share was over 2.5% in pre-market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to make a profit between 10.40 $and 10.90 $in the fiscal year that ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected a poll of FactSet 10.84 $.
Despite price increases, estimated at an average of 4.9%, and on 4 January, and with higher premiums for drilling heavy and large packages, which will be increased from November onwards, the lower prospects will be less than 4.9%.
The company has said that it still expects the earnings to increase over the previous year, owing to reduced costs, increased revenues, and growth in online trading.
As Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said, company yields "solid returns when considering weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for holidays employment were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS, which plans to cease 90.000 to 95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to 2.42 $per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, the twelve analysts predicted by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent to €12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has recorded a decline in international priority deliveries over the past few years.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transport increased by 29%, but the operating result was essentially flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues as a result of higher prices, while the result was due to increased labour costs in the freight sector.
In pre-market trading, roughly one hour before the opening, the FedEx shares increased by 3.85 $, or 2.5%, to 150,15 $.
On Tuesday, they closed 11 percent for the year and 17 percent at a record high on 11 June.
In its most anticipated part-session in years, Federal Reserve strategists spent two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise its interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Looming over them at an end of the decorated, two-storey boardroom is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues is expected to place the nation's economic interests before all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximises US employment and prices.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed has recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate may be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to recover from the unprecedented incentive from the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data on the economy show that it is solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could frighten the already wary Fed officials from strengthening these volatility by raising interest rates on federal bonds - and even a quarter% point.
"Apparently the labor market and inflation are first and foremost the most important thing that they see," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economics at the Maklercompany Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if it were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is sufficient justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, creating uncertainty for itself.
About half of the economists, who were interviewed recently by Bloomberg, predicted the rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed, with a key indicator, showing only a 30% chance to increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market, if the Fed increases the rate unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is a long way off.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial cost jumped at 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintained the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this point, "he said.
If it does, "it should go a long way in its statement to reassure financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that an interest-rate hike would reassure financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed poised to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that, despite the liberals, this year, it would expect more economic progress, an increase in the sentence.
Although job creation slowed down in August, improvement in the labour market was robust this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest since more than seven years, and near the level that the Fed views as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And, while inflation was still below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed's representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices.
The economy "can deal with higher interest rates and needs it because of the growth in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdard, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets spread across the world at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average was more than 16% below its peak in May, as investors feared that the Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now being almost 10% lower than the peak of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence influence complex calculations, when interest rates should be increased.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of China's economy had not occurred in the past few weeks, they would attract the reins'," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former United States Federal Reserve employee.
Now he says that it will wait at least one month to better manage the effect.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's priorities, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But, in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The Central Bank's influence over the last few years has been enormous.
The mere announcement of the former President Ben Paul Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow down" monetary expansion caused confusion around the world.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly interdependent, the Fed officials may be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to advise with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art as science," said Zachary Karabell, director of the global strategy for asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to economic fundamentals.
A member of the Federal Open Market Committee, a qualified member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he argues for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998-1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions, "despite a limited impact on growth in the US," he said.
One year later, the Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should focus on financial stability only during a major crisis such as the 2008 collapse of the United States, "said Adam S. Poznań, a former member of the Committee on Rate Recession of the Bank of England.
The recent turmoil is not close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to fall into the situation in which they are afraid of an increase in interest rates, because the markets are getting exciting," said Poznań, President of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The stock market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.

The kitchen (good and cheap) in this shop is near the ticket office and has a variety of options.
What's there: Do you need something - something - Thai?
Lax-C has probably.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean up the fish and cook and even serve on request.
A good part of the shop is the massive freeze-unit, where you will find frozen curries, bitter melon and noble, whole ducks, fish, cows and galle, pigs-natural, fish dyes, local sausage, commercially prepared foods and more.

Parking: Lax-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well-attended, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Short Life Aid for Refugees
More and more refugees come from Germany on these days.
To welcome you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers.
Even in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support altruistic asylum seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher and a teacher.
Even with their 74 lilies, they continue to teach them.
Every Thursday it does it in the asylum seeker at the Dillinger Straße.
It helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language.
Of course, this is a very different lesson than at the right school.
Brazilian pediatric company Rio Grande will promote healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS attempts to warn women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding; it does so with the presentation of babies who suck in breasts that are painted by unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are forced to increase their daily caloric intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher caloric intake is not the only dietary supplement that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The council at Bernried approved the construction application for the Euro 2.3 million sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof can be flatter for solar panels.
The plans for the long-awaited post-building industry at the Bernrieder Sportareal are a step forward step by step: In the most recent municipal meeting, the construction application was unanimously approved without major discussions.
Previously, the Board adopted, among other things, a proposal for a "derogation" of "respectable" exemption from the valid building plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Therefore, a "roof roof with non-joined first and roof outstanded" is to be built.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels. "This gives us a wonderful large southern roof," the mayor Josef Steigenberger stated in the session.
The "liberation" was once again concerned with the roof, which, for energy reasons, was supposed to be less than ten degrees, unlike the planned plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary, because the housing plan does not allow for 'exceptions' in the roofing scheme, whereas the Bernrieder municipal council usually takes a restrictive approach when it comes to liberalisations.
However, this project is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," so Steigenberger.
Radio broadcasting in the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and of the SV Bernried.
The costs are estimated at around EUR 2.3 million.
Grants are expected from the training and grassroots sport promotion.
At the end of the procedure the building application for the 18 x 36 m high hall will be presented for examination.
Clinic Peißenberg draws to Schongau
The hospital Peißenberg is scheduled to be closed earlier - in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will be the new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is demonstrated by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the Landkreis, the country director Andrea Jochner-White.
However, a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board, and the meeting will take place on Wednesday, 23 September.
If plans are implemented, then all of them would be employed at the hospital in Peißenberg.
The overwhelming majority should move with fishermen and the existing inner station to Schongau.
The rooms are present.
In Weilheim, the employees who are unable to work with Schongau should be offered a job, such as Jochner-White.
Employees are informed about the plans.
The change is due to the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and has now moved to a private practice in the vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who should succeed, came into play according to Jochner-white, the name 'fisherman' who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means, in each case, a "appreciation" and a broadening of the range in the field of "internal medicine," so Jochner-white.
Fischer specializes in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Chongau (180 beds) specialises in gastroenterological illnesses inside the station.
Over the next two years, if the Supervisory Board decides to approve the next two years, it will have both houses until next year, after almost 140 years, the former hospital of more than 35 beds will have to be closed down in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far this has been planned for 2018 if the current rehabilitation at the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
A member of the Board of Directors of Jochner-White, who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, has argued that the House, which is in possession of the Federal Reserve, should henceforth be used as an accommodation for asylum seekers.
"I would like to say that I cannot say that Jochner-White did not say that there were several considerations.
At the moment there is a short-term care of caritas and a topical psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity did not come again," said fishermen about the quasi-relocation to the Lech, which was welcomed by the employees "positive and very sympathetic."
A real perspective for the House, where fishermen have been working as a doctor for 30 years, has not been.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take the position of the medical director.
The Hospital Peißenberg (once 100 beds) has always been under threat during the last decades, and departments have been closed, for example, the surgery and the assistance of births.

Hunting with two injured persons at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the reduction in a corn field at Pratau (County Wittenberg) several hunters were deployed, as reported by the police.
After a shot in charge, a 30-year-old man and a 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals.
The exact situation in which the accident occurred was initially unclear.
The criminal police investigation.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crime
A suspected crime has led the police to address the age-missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old man killed the young people and threw their corpses into a channel in Rockenhausen.
Since Saturday, 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate has been the victim of a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, such as the public prosecutor's office and the police on Wednesday morning.
There is also a 20-year-old 20-year-old arrested on Tuesday evening which, according to the evidence, showed that the investigator and the investigators led to the location of the corpse.
The 16-year-old was reported on Sunday morning after she was unable to come home on Sunday after a visit to Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators came first from the victim's personal belongings.
In the case of interviews with the friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, a crime against the 20-year-old has emerged.
The alleged perpetrator led the police then to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the detainees were reported to have killed the 16-year-old and placed the corpse in the channel.
The 20-year-old was supposed to be presented on Wednesday at the behest, the investigators put his death toll on him.
More information on the immediate circumstances are intended to carry out further investigations.
Refugees need shelter: A study warns of housing gaps.
The location on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long started.
With the incoming refugees and labour seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens about the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 each year.
In order to achieve this result, a study was carried out on behalf of the joint venture "Social Housing."
For comparison: This year 260,000 units are ready in Germany.
This means that there are a total of 140,000 homes.
Refugees are no longer obliged after the first three months of their stay to live as asylum seekers in a first accommodation accommodation.
Many people come to the housing market and face the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers have lived in the last year.
The negative development of the housing market, however, is not only about increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also shows significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is shooting a housing deficit that is growing year-on-year.
There are currently about 770,000 accommodation units missing in the conurbations, lamented Matthias Günther, the author of the study.
Therefore, many professionals in large-scale cities are well-known in WG rooms.
Young adults remained unwillingly on the "Hotel Mama" for longer stays on the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the "Social Housing" alliance proposes a reboot.
New incentives are intended to boost social housing.
In this way, the basic duty-free tax could be waived and the basic tax on subsidised housing would be temporarily suspended.
In addition, the alliance provides for attractive tax depreciation opportunities.
The support programme for refugee accommodation in the KfW National Bank is already well-known among cities and communities.
A good week after the start on Monday evening, EUR 184 million had already been taken over more than half of the EUR 300 million available.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free authority: Croatia and Slovenia are preparing a corridor for a corridor.
After Hungary, there is virtually no passage, since more and more refugees are choosing the way through Croatia.
Zagreb has announced plans to extend the route via Slovenia to the North without any obstacles.
However, dangerous is the route.
Croatia intends to agree on the establishment of a corridor for refugees with neighbouring Slovenia.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian Home Secretary and, if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said the Croatian Minister for Home Affairs Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have been broken up in Croatia to get to Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV broadcast RTL.
Hungary had closed its frontier for refugees on the previous day.
New laws entered into force on the same day, moreover, make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: 'You can go through and we are preparing for this possibility'.
These people are there, they are women, children and men who live and want to live.
However, it was people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police took over the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbour Croatia.
Most of them were media reports from Syria, Iran, and Afghanistan.
You came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border city of sid.
Immediately upon arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border into Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not cross border fences.
There are other threats to border; there are clear mines from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 1990 "s.
Mine-mindedness should now quickly create a safe passage.
After the closure of Hungary, after the closure of Hungary, there are hardly any refugees.
On Tuesday, the police of 366 were injured.
Shortly before the gate was on Monday, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian laws stage the removal and damage of the border fence as a criminal offence.
In the southern Hungarian border city of Szeged, therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
The sentenced parties face prison sentences of up to five years, and expulsion from the country.
According to information provided by the immigration authority, on Tuesday, in the new "transedons" on the border, they received a total of 94 asylum applications, almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition to Röszke.
Among the applications were 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees there.
In practice, however, no-one has any prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian opinion, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.
There are only a few hundred refugees from the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke started to clean up workers.
They collected the waste that tens of thousands of people had left on the street side in recent weeks.
Barriers were removed and one of the host camps in the border town was rebuilt.
Nobody wanted to say anything about this restructuring.
Austria, after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, is only a few refugees.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
However, more than 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government information.
About 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany in Salzburg.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
In Freight, smaller groups of refugees arrived at foot on a regular basis.
Mayors drove "rock sides" over the border
"We were occupied after the bridge fest on Sunday with the cleaning up, when ten people were at the receiving end of the tent at the entrance to the tent," said Alexander Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists who wanted to travel to Passau.
Because Germany was surprisingly closed on Sunday, but as a result of the influx of refugees, it was in Wernstein's end, "Stadler, who immediately invited his help, along with two other helpers and their cars on the border in the vicinity of Passau.
First of all, we tried the unanticipated guests first time, with lots of breaks and drinks.
We said straight away, we bring them with the car to Passau.
"This was of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN.
They were very grateful.
A man could not take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"It gives us great pleasure," says Stadler.
The train passengers were stranded on Sunday evening in Wels by an ICE train in a direction to Passau, and after the short-term announcement that railway traffic had been stopped by Germany, but still on the border.
The regional train has been stopped at the Inn at Wernstein on the edge of Wernstein.
In Wernstein, the cross-border crossing is generally high in the course.
The association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, sociable, day before a two-bridge circuit, organised by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán now sends tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of in the camp Röszke immediately helping to establish structures that ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has made high official and public the attitude of the Hungarian Government in the Dark Horn of National Socialism.
It is not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
Even the people who have been drowned will find that the "promised land," which she invited and welcomed, is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the ongoing flows of refugees and the coming winter, in which we face a dignified condition for those seeking refuge.
And it will be even more important - peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad, based on the search for 35,000 winter-level Quarters
Konrad has full capacity for dealing with refugee refugees.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight.
The government has deployed the former powerful Raiffeisen bankers in order to establish districts for the thousands of refugees.
In the first reception center Traiskirchen, Konrad has already got under control.
"We have no homeless more in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
Even the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday to Austria was done without a fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterpiece."
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, was talking about a "crisis situation."
In total, Konrad, with a requirement of 85,000 quartz, counts in this year's year.
In order to meet the number, 35 000 hotels will have to be found in the next few weeks.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it is not a bottomless pit," Konrad said.
He has already had discussions with the local capitals.
They would have assured him that they would also be able to come to the next refugee camps.
"In Upper Austria it is working well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, who will explain how the Church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also has high hopes on the ORF campaign "Helfen wie us."
On the platform, private individuals can provide accommodation with ease.
You can also see the hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticised yesterday's standards for accommodation as "very high."
In case of emergency, it should not be possible that travel providers have to comply with a certain amount of the load or size of the upper ceilings.
For a fixed time, there should be "emergency standards."
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, it was more successful, founded on the basis of his experience.
I am an old gentleman, and one of the things you do not see is falsehood.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not create costs, as they themselves stated.
Their number of employees wants to increase them to three to four.
So far, it has not yet been successful in its own quarters.
Konrad wanted to establish a container at St. Stephen's Square as an office.
However, there are obviously problems with approval.
Linz calls for better division
For the time being, no opening urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees are planning the city of Linz.
That is not necessary at the moment, as they are currently unable to accommodate these measures, says mayors Klaus Luger (SP).
For an emergency, other sites should be checked for their suitability.
Criticism takes place on the part of the city's leaders in the distribution of refugees within the Federal State.
Other districts must also play their part.
Seehofer: "Borders will not be closed"
In an extended telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), President-in-Office of the European Union, Josef Pühringer (VP), addressed the refugee question on Monday.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed.
The travel of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, it is precisely the appropriate border controls.
There will be no more flights to Germany from now on.
However, the interested parties would be transferred to Germany with regular trains.
For the other EU member states, Pühringer called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is now introducing controls on its borders is a logical consequence of German action.
The next Runtastic is a Question Time
The general overhaul of the "New Shipyard" in the Linzer Industrial Line has been officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production buildings, the stock exchange-based IT S S & T, the remainder (2700 square meter), is intended to be rented to young and innovative companies from the field of technology.
"In IT, the intelligent heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us," says S & T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies in the New Shipyard, and later on to acquire them.
Right from the outset, S & T intends to cooperate with the new neighbours, something that Lower Schaffhausen promises to be doing: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time."
1.7 million euros were invested by S & T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the TechCenter, which is one third of the city's city Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Government (FFG).
The building is covered by Linz AG for 60 years on S & T as well as TechCenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of residual area in the building are already rented, for a further 40% there are questions.
LIA-Peroni holder opened second shop in the arcade.
In the new shop Furla handbags are the focus of attention.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog.
This project had to postpone the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt arcade.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where it sells bags, bags, shoes and garments from various manufacturers, it is now all about women's handbags from the Furla brand, who have money markets from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to EUR 500.
Since yesterday, the new shop is in operation.
Previously, several weeks have been reconstructed.
"However, I thought long enough whether I would like to open a shop," says Breit.
The decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are in Bologna at home, were impressed by the idea of a separate site where they sold their bags.
"We are the only ones in the area of Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who themselves have their own Italian roots.
Their fashion interests have been brought to the cradle by their mother.
I am most likely to see something developing and show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women do not have a nice hand pocket when they see a nice hand pocket, the lady doesn't know how to answer your questions.
Maybe it is because a nice bag of every outfit will appreciate.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump's ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose residents are called givers.
This property also shares some of the billionaires who want to become US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for emotions.
Whether or not it advocates xenophobic opinions, journalists, or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency is stirring up the campaign.
And cuts well on it.
This will also be registered in the Silesian Kallstadt where the grandparents of the real estate won millions of dollars.
The New Yorker with the conciliator is a concept in the winegrowing village on the Wine Road.
Some people in the 1200-resident village have more than -yumb corners with it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate, Donald Trump, in the campaign mode.
The Kallstader Simone Wendel shot a movie about Trump.
And what are the villagers who think about being the most powerful man in the world?
"I think that these things are fascinating, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter Art," says Simone Wendel.
The born Kallstadt has filmed an amusing documentary film about the town and its famous jumps, among which Trump also counts the Ketchup family Heinz counts.
Trump, who does not know for modesty, comes to "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014), so he said that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
For the King's heart he didn't bring it there.
Admittedly, respect for the family's performance, but it tends that Trump is a little bigger than that, says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname "The Brulljesmacher" ("The Brulljesmacher") was loud, "The Brulljesmacher" - the giver, she says.
Trump, therefore, comes from the village of the givers.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and in the United States opened a pub for gold graves.
The foundation of the real estate group was the first real estate acquisitions in New York.
But the life of grandparents was not free of tragedy: Their desire to return to their homes in time, failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged to.
He did not record Trump, because he had been swallowed up without a permit, the director of the Institute for Silesian History and Folk Folk, Roland Paul, explained the film start.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant."
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants.
It has repeatedly spoken out on Mexican immigrants in the US, calling for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Like the polder, it is not as sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant cousin ("The Oma was a born Trump, the Opa was born Heinz").
In retirement, the winegrowers tend to distance themselves from the Americans, "he is always so unstoppable."
Does he think that Trump may come?
"I cannot imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He didn't care for Kallstadt."
The guesthouse Veronika Schchart has been mentioned, like some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the family Heinz was a visit to the church organ during a visit, which was generally good.
"I cannot imagine the Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if it did not vote for it, because "it has such radical views, I do not know whether that is good."
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States, they would have been like him, "he wouldn't have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.
And when President?
"My President is not," she says.
And, "the grapes will be ripe even without President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen between 12 000 students, including in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian Municipality Ramsau at Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain auction village."
From the Vice-President's hand at the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800 inhabitants village in the Berchtesgaden National Park was awarded the award for mild tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountain auction villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the local Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
An "mountain auction village" must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its surface area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite the attempts of Nine to take the lead in the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson went to Canberra to report the loss of leader of liberals, but there has been no major shifts in the assessments for Today.
The breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital, when Malcolm Turnbull abolished Tony Abbott's fall.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was employed in London as part of a weekly series of international TV shows including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage did not appear for Australian TV viewers, since sunrise was an average of 397,000 spectators at the five capital cities, compared to Today 339,000.
Today, there was a slight increase in ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained below the last Thursday (343,000).
Today, the gap to Sunrise has been closed in recent months.
In August, we had an average of 318,000 compared to 318,000 by Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 314,000 spectators on average 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star from packto the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently lost father, who decides to settle with his two children on the New Zealand coast, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics asked whether Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The outcome of yesterday evening answered with a clear "yes."
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and was easy to beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726000).
He had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half an hour (17: 00 to 5.30) of the new quiz show was moderated by Andrew O'Keorie on average 446,000 spectators.
The second half an hour (17: 30 to 18: 00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires's Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour was 720,000.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The fall in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that hot-seat will ultimately prevail at 17: 30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for $1 million that it did not manage to outlaw the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Mystery reveals?...
Lana Jeenes-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly see who the Bachelor wins.
The woman, at which Sam Wood ends in The Bachelor, was filled with the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether they are the ones who have received the last rose.
But as we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jez.@-@ Fellows on the day before coming from three two, you might have inadvertently given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips on its lips until the final on Thursday.
All three women have missed out on lyrical about why wood is the perfect man and he called his sense of humour, ambition, family value and positive attitude as reasons why she wanted to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked "If not you, who should get the Woods last Rose," could be their answers to the spoils, who won the heart of Bachelors.
Jez.@-@ Fellows and Markoski called both fast - apart from themselves - Mackay as the best partner for wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment when I went to the House and (Sarahs) and Sams energies noticed, I felt that they were fairly compatible, and I thought that all of the show was thought out ', said Jez.@-@ Fellows throughout the entire course of the show.
"Sarah stands on the ground with both feet on the ground, it makes so much fun to be joined together," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
You feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well-suited to couples.
From their point of view, Mackay said that the home visit last week made it clear that Wood could be "The One."
"Once I saw it with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now fully committed to it," she said.
And when she was asked, who should elect Wood, if not she was puzzled.
"I do not know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a match between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor's degree will be broadcasted on 10 on Wednesday, 19: 30.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his career career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tominson, and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have told Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game, when he lost a wranger as it did when it took off rugby league Convertit on his first punt-return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But tomato confided his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also in the ongoing game after a breach of Reggie Bush.
Tominson continued to show his true face in the dressing rooms after the match.
Instead of picking his rookies ahead of the rest of the team from the mill, he encouraged them.
Tominson strengthened Hayne also publicly in his press conference after the match.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patchy catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patched on a punt that was restored in the first district of the Minnesota Vikings.
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian entourage had hoped for his turntable debut.
Hayne left behind the Fumble, and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy to 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have a worse start into his career career.
"This was a thing that happens now, you only take care of the next game, and that is it," Hayne said.
Hayne used to make his debut debut in 2007, when a pass led to a Try for Queensland in his own target area.
All in all, however, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old age.
Hayne presented for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the match and postete it in his instagram.

Outdoor voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned about the start of the FW Autumn FW in Greater Wallstadt before a severe crisis in Bavaria's schools, if there were no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we will have disruptions in the Bavarian education system."
The Day Fee of the Free electorate is held by Friday in the Franconian municipality.
In fact, there were a number of other key issues.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the free-voter meeting.
"Of course, the subject of asylum will outsource the examination," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, just as they existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s.
"So it goes no further, we need to address the causes," said the free voter.
Outgoing asylum seekers want to postpone the free electorate as quickly as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum law: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW Chief criticized the fact that several federal states were not consistent: 'We needed uniform standards across the federal states'.
"Bavaria pushes off, others not."
'We have to become more able to act '.
But regional politics in large-scale cities should not fall under the carpet.

But that doesn't go far enough.
"The issue of G9 must be accelerated," said the FW Chief.
We want freedom of choice for all Gymnasia, who want that.
Free ride on the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 People were killed after police rubber shovels were shot on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot in a crowd of crowds, demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday evening in the Crocodile district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishop nu Prasad Dhakal, Department of Local officials, said that there were more than 1,000 demonstrators outside a police station, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
MR Dhakal said, the police have used tear gas and then cast in the air before it took back on rubber bumpers.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why they were able to kill, of which they may be able to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently that they produced such a high death rate.
The debate was the last days of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violence since the 10th anniversary.
August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to distribute the country to provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which for centuries had been centrally governed.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators have speeded up the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.

Emden - The city of Emden wants to market an approximately 4000 square metre property in direct vicinity to the Old Post Youth Centre.
The preparations for this are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of trade, industry and living.
You are waiting for the appropriate offers, which means that the city has a lot to offer.
Which investor needs to be questioned is not yet clear.
After all, no contracts have been concluded.
The city Emden had already bought part of the plot, which was on the Ringstrasse / corner, a few months ago.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the housing settlement on the small sea in Emden are taking shape.
For the first time, the investor submitted public plans for the project.
Many of them are still concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure activity.
For months, negotiations were conducted behind closed doors, debated, debated and drawn up.
Well, there are plans for a new holiday home settlement on the small sea near Emden on the table.
The prospective customer, the medium-sized Emder company "Systems Construction," was publicly presented for the first time on Monday night in the Urban Development Committee of the Emden Council.
Originally it was on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), Ralf Behrends went on the offensive: "We have not yet answered all questions," he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to see all the rumors now.
The estimated ten to EUR 12 million projects have been under discussion for months.
Strong reactions among marine owners that came into the session called the images and new details on the desired hotel building.
Mr Schulz, Mr Schulz, is a member of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
Moreover, like many other project critics, he fears that traffic will increase sharply as a result of the planned size of the plant: "There will have to be a bus charge," says Schulz.
However, it is still open on the very good one-hectare area of the former restaurant.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Due to this missing, the building plans are still variable.
Zwillings Elves in Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to young people from all over the world.
The 26-year-old Dian yesterday brought twins to the world.
Pairs of births are rare in the case of gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was nearly 50 years back and in 1967 was also in Frankfurt, it means the zoo.
The sex of the newborn Gorilla twins is not yet clear, since Mother Dian has a close relationship with her.
First of all, the "picture" was reported.
NHC says 60-percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands.
The US National Hurricane Center, on Tuesday, at a low-pressure system, said about 350 miles (560 km) south from the most southern Cape Verde islands, which have a 60-percent chance to develop into a tropical cyclist in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60-percent potential to create a tropical cyclist over the next two days, adding the weather experts in Miami.
Google's release campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (Google Inc.) announced a duplication campaign campaign, which aims to raise $11 million to humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations since they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach in announcing the donation call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud wrote a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, about her personal experiences.
"Our trip included many dark rail and bus routes, equally hungry, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
However, as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donor money doubles up to $11 million in a value of 5.5 million on google.com / foreclosures.
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many are fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study.
It is too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes are more likely to live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote a feature on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obese surgery uses different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity-based operations for the treatment of type-2 diabetes have been efficient, but most studies have been carried out on people who are obese with a body mass index (BMI) from 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a survey since 2007 and compare two types of obesity-based surgery - heartburn and stomach shavings - for medical treatment for type 2 diabetes among people who were easily overweight.
The average BMI has fallen from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, BMI has remained in those "non-surgical" treatment sessions roughly equal to 29.
Among those subjected to a surgical procedure, 36% of the disease suffered completely and at 28% in part.
In the mediated medical treatment group, compared to diabetes, there was only one percent and in some cases only about two percent.
Furthermore, the results in the controls of blood pressure, the triglyceride and the "bad" LDL cholesterol, "in general, were better in the 'surgical' group ', the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patients "blood level set by Hämoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemogglobin A1c, which is best below 7%, writes the researchers.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c fell from around 9% to approximately 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable at around 8%.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin in A1c level - did not reduce the mortality in five years, so women researchers Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost weight in comparison with the Gastrektomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), reaching higher declines in the BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and recorded a total breakdown of the diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not have a survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that leads to surgery for longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, in the case of obese people subjected to obesity, some 29% less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said that it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously when the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think that we are waiting too long for us to encourage people to take this seriously," they said.
I think that, as soon as they have accumulated these genetic modifications, which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard. '
Love history plays in Hunsrück.
It is an issue that is being increasingly taken into consideration in fiction: A young woman, during school hours, and unearthly, meets the warm of her young people after years, and this falls in love with them.
So even in the recently published novel "We are not so called" of Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel should be particularly interesting for Hunsrück readers, since it plays in Langweiler and surrounding towns.

"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real resolution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is falling.
Tibetan Buddhist leaders called for the end of violence in the countries' home countries.
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which devotes itself to ethics studies.
It demanded that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be confronted with the interests of the individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of the countries of Western Europe to the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Several thousand refugees are wonderful, but in the meantime, you will have to think about long-term solutions, such as true peace and development, primarily through education, for these Muslim countries, he stressed.
Finally, we need to reflect on how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence, and has also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attack of 11 September, pointing out that the US's violent response has led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I gave my condolences to President Bush and I said that the way to resolve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has had unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
4% increase by children over the last 4 years
Small-scale control centres in the USA report an almost 400% increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who have a very high level of alcohol abuse, such as Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia Poison Center, the cases of revenue for children under the age of 12, under 12 years of abuse control centres, reported from 3.266 in 2010 on 16.117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them are arriving in the emergency," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants while some are doing it to impress their friends or a mutation in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young disinfectants will only be able to drink because of a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing oral water to preserve a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child does not think that this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hands-disinfectants) are those that are paraffable.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapes and orange juice, which are very attractive for children.
Hangdedesinfection resources contain between 45 and 95% of alcohol.
Especially with young children, very few injections can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Giftnotcall center in the hospital of the University of Kansas, the station Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So you would not have to be a whisper whisper, but people do not use this hand-disinfectant in the range of children, and if children come to it, then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four injections into school from a strawberry-rich scatter-disinfectant, was taken into hospital for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that was drunk by an adult in law as drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency reception doctor, who was treated to the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah ah lallte her words and was not able to go as she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors watched them overnight in a separate children's hospital house on signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen out of alcohol and had his head met, said Ritchey.
"This was very frightening," said Local oria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
He has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and stockholders outside of the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In the year 2013, two women in Ontario died after slashing decrimination were killed, which contained a toxic, non-declared ingredient.
Staff of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohols noted as an active substance.
In January, three students from the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their "mixed" teachers by issuing anti-bacterial products around the classroom, "reports a police report.
The teacher has a high level of allergic injury to the head of the head and has been sent out of her room.
The police looked at the failed plan as "heath," referring disciplinary measures to the school authority.

The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national player, Ronald de Boer, has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why?"
It is because the Rangers are not there.
People here are talking not only about the return of Rangers.
You are talking about the Old Firm.
You talk about both teams and that is what they want.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it is not only the people of Scotland who want to see these games.
I am going to turn things around, I am angry.
Ronny Deila has accepted that Celtic have to fight, but the Norwegian boss has muzzled the things.

Now we want to come out as quickly as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel that this is exactly the same, but we must continue.
We really need the support of Celtic, because that makes players better.
It is important to come together now.
Warburton cautious in January transfers
Despite his comments only a couple of weeks ago, pointing out that he was trying to get some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton has been cautious about the signing of new entrants and insisting that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox Kaderer.
The ex-chief of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come to the summer season have this pre-season to integrate what you saw with our own group during this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.

Why I am a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, with the exception of late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
When it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I will be sitting in a spectator gallery in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, where Richard Glossip is executed by the Giftspritze.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made in January of his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day was closer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I voted in favour, because I thought it was a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States and, since there are often more applications than places available, there will be a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media venues from 12 to five.
Who will be selected will watch it untouchless.
I cannot.
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossips's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone and a two-and-a-half hour trip.
I like the guy.
We often laugh often when we speak.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to record a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just need to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma refused me on Twitter to give up my impartiality.
That is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner, how he wants it, and you will gain access.
I agree with her.
She admitted that she could "better speak," but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and written.
He does not tell me what I have to write, and I would not do it myself, even if he did.
I told him that he would be able to remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public relations campaign against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from Huffington Post, will be sitting beside me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have made.
I do not want to go into all the details.
I cannot say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he will not be guilty of murder.
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective I will see him dying.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters who you can call on to do so.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after he was embarrassed by police persecution to come out of the Canning River to come from the Canning River.
The canning Vale police officer remained dry when he overstated the man of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man of Perth to guard the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and marshy water, only a few yards away from a police officer who tried "him gently to persuade him to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale was called on Tuesday for a break-down incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspects, they tried to escape them in the direction of Canning River.
But he did not come far too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I am not going out, come and get me," said Senior Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not all too excited about making his uniform wet, so he had a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior O. Castledine.
Championship football players Ben Cousins is an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins drove his car to the ditch to escape alcohol and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts have been fruitless, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins bible.
Peter Moody claims that stewards have tried to spy on him and are threatening to stop racing.
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a spion in their stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He focused on the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing, and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt test sample at Lidaris that he could not explain.
He had withheld 18 months of spying charges and did not want it to be "out of height."
"I had nothing to say about this, and I have been eating it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything is coming out," said Moody.
You know that it went on.
It sometimes reacts and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go, and I want my owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking I do not, then I should not be coach.
I have to consider what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had run the bomb in an interview with racing.com, that the integrity department tried to spy on its stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name, if I was asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information on what I am doing in my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
They seem to believe that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should surely make a mistake, because they have failed in trying to catch up with me.
President of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, President-in-Office of the RVL and the current CEO of RVL, were aware of the times and are still today.
Should that be the case, that it will be personally?
Did the RVL behave in a cowardly manner, and perhaps people outside of trainers are responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there, that I am there.
Perhaps they should take my licence and do so and I have no doubt that what I am talking about is going to reflect it now.
But I have reached the point at which I don't care about that, and that makes me sad.
That makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The training level of the trainer was based on the long-lasting cobalt examination at Lidari, and the late Scratching led him to say that he had "his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unbroken master of Black Caviar, called the day treatment rule "ridiculous," after a pack of mud or clay was applied on the horse carriages, which was broken down by the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this, "he said.
"One of my staff mistakenly applied mud on the leg.
It could have been so yesterday evening.
It should have been the whole day yesterday, and that was the case.
But it was on the racing day as well.
With a triennial disqualification for treatment with the pack on the day of the race, we could face an investigation into this matter.
It is a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We are all aware that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," said Moody.
Who arrested for driving on the train was arrested
At the end of the week, the police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist and followed the evacuation of the aircraft in Cobram.
The cyclist was sent to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Murray-Valley-highway.
The police said the car driver continued to continue, without stopping the injured driver.
On Monday there was a 50-year old man from Nathalia of the Police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be indicted for drivers and for failure to provide assistance and for other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year old man from Cobram, remains in hospital and is in a stable state.
Melbourne-Storm coach Craig Bellamy proposes against rivals for allegations of ring fights back.
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy has criticised its players as an "agenda setting" of the NRL's two Premier League favorites.
Sydney ROOSTERS Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referee has allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening.
Apart from being a member of the team at the end of his career, Bronco's trainer, Wayne Bennett, made a statement to the storm team, when his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, and he called the game a "sample" of the Rugby League and said that the two out of Queensland are not "too good" in their rings.
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that she only concentrated on her "contact" in the Tackling.
Bellamy added that the critics of two leading trainers are confident in his team as it means that they worry about being beaten by the storm team.
"Again and again - I did not hear that Trent Robinson talked about ring battles when she beaten us 24: 2 beaten," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or the techniques all year round, but over the past six weeks, we have made our contact with Tackles a real priority, and this has given us the trend.
For three years now he has a great team and he is probably not accustomed to getting used to it, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is funny, as always happens in this season.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "dull" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He played his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday night and how exciting her game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a dull team, and Wayne said that he was going to take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and which we consider to be exciting, especially its young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all its kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like them.
I have greater confidence because they say these things, because they are somewhat concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they did not think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against ROOSTERS achieved a higher result than the game of bronze against cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably a good game, I did not see it, but what was the result 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two other tests in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks, there are no points?
For me, it is the game plans.
When they mention, it means that we will meet at a stage.

A man who may be suffering a life sentence because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kg of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released on a bail-out of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and was set in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed how he met his colleagues in the Marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possibly viable punishment for trying to produce a commercial crowd of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to have the whole lot and that he could have been out of the Café for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the threat of flight to Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he declared the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the criminal case, he had lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics's mother and stepfather had offered a bail-out of $200,000 for security in order to secure his release.
"After reading the official explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent it from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he issued his Australian and his Serbian passport, reported to the police daily, and sent to an initial blocking of 18: 00-06: 00.
Accident at the University of Karlsruhe: Guide house disintegrate.
In case of a crash involving three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe, one truck driver has been severely injured on the Tuesday night.
Two of the three trucks involved had slowed down from a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to depart at the last minute to the left as the police reported.
The operator's house of the accident caused by the accident was completely different.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord closed out more than 6 hours until 2 o'clock.
There has been damage amounting to EUR 122,000.
Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to entice paedophiles to send images.
A paedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl, when that slept, settled into an online messaging service, which he received a number of decent pictures of children who had been sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later on and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping Hogg.
They saw it, found confusing news and alarmed immediately their mother.
The police took care of this and saw the five pictures, analyzed then computers that were found below the address and discovered "specific" web research, which used the terms to search for undecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet" and then "first to be a policeman to frighten them."
The Attorney Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said that it was an addiction that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer, but said that it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said that he did it to attract them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks and said that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
MS Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the mouth and in the wine.
They then saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused by doing so.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant computer and Playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than they did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty, in the sense of the indictment, of the illegal images of children on 14 June last year, to have violated the conditions on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be seen in the register of sexual criminals, as it could be argued that "no major sexual element" in his or her crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael suspended the sentence until October to preserve background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted in this case, but was held in custody due to hearings on other outstanding cases.
It was recorded before the date of the sentence in the directory of sexual offenders.
Lock-keeper on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are taken apart from the major checkpoints at the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people more at lower border crossings because of fear of discovery and arrest.
On the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
Along the border river Inn, there were more than 1000 refugees on the outskirts of Passau and Rottal-Inn.
They were on foot on bridges and dams on the German side.
They are received by federal police officers and will be sent to the registration process.
At the main train station in Munich, according to Federal Police figures, more refugees were killed again on Wednesday at the weekend of the week.
Only about 700 people arrived in the capital until 8: 00, said a speaker in the morning.
After the re-establishment of controls on the German-Austrian border, the city had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: A tropical storm "Henry" in the south-west was expected.
Meteorologists warn against thunderstorms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area above Western Europe flows currently warm sea air is entering the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart with.
The mighty Tief was the descendant of the tropical storm "Henry," which over the last few days has been pulled over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands.
Violent storms and thunderstorms are especially expected in Baden.
According to DWD, it will be possible until Thursday morning, in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance region, from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour.
On Friday, the sun is again on the horizon.
The mass is: Every two years the car manufacturers show their novelties on the IAA.
In 2015, there is a particular movement on the compact cars, which are currently being sold particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly sensitive: About 28.1 percent of the new registrations were found on this segment in August only in August.
This is also reflected at the IAA (publication of 17th until 27th September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new upper-class and luxury cars this year many new compact models will be presented.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the stores in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra will not be much more expensive.
Opel presents an entrance to the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra has a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen / Germany provides additional diesel and petrol engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp, for the first time three cylinders.
Apart from being the major competitor of the VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra was first only as a five-fifths.
The second version will follow in the spring of the Combi, which can be seen on the IAA.
And what next to the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault returns the fourth generation of its Astra rival Mégane.
At the trade fair the Mégane is only seen as a five-fifths in a conventional and a more sporting GT version.
In trade it comes from the beginning of next year, and then as a combi.
Infiniti: Completely new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan dealer wants to find its position in the growing segment with the new model.
With its winding lines, the compact Infiniti fits perfectly into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will be a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp.
But there is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model will be powered by gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbocharged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp.
The maximum torque depends on the manufacturer's specifications of 170 NewtonMeter (Nm).
The opening of the baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact model DS 4, which should be seen at the IAA.
On the other hand, the designer of the high-quality Citroën holder made a very special hand in front part of the camera: The fridge was redrawn and the changed headlamps have been fitted with LED technology.
Above all, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and was first integrated into the Apples CarPlay.
In addition, on the IAA in the compact class a number of revisions and new variants like the new Mercedes A Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are available.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meter cell are unworthy of human beings
The Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex-prisoner of Tegel law enforcement, which was part of a small cell for months.
Because of violations of their human dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are found in small cells.
The Federal Constitutional Court decided in a decision on Wednesday.
The parties concerned can even hope for money, even if they have been imprisoned only a few days in the tight spaces (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner with his constitutional decree was successful in Karlsruhe. He was housed in the Berlin-Tegel law enforcement institution between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square metres of ground floor space; the toilet was not separated from a single cell.
After that, the man was moved to a larger cell, according to his lawyer's instructions.
His detention situation, owing to the undignified detention conditions against the country of Berlin, failed.
However, the Constitutional Court passed the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and pointed out the case for re-examination.
They are violating human dignity.
Court Court will now decide on the level of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, it was only a few days of detention during the period in question, there was a certain amount of compensation.
Otherwise, "a complication of the legal protection of personality" is supposed to be feared. "
The Court Court must now clarify the level of damage suffered.
In the past, the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they only spoke to a prisoner of damages because he was buried naked in a cell.
What is unworthy of a 2011 decision, according to in 2011, is the multiple assignment of a cell without a separate toilet.
In addition, in 1994, he confirmed that the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009, had confirmed a disworthy accommodation.
The then plaintiff spent three months every day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in Karlsruhe.
The Berlin prisons have also come to the headlines in recent weeks, due to lack of staff.
Therefore, prisoners are constantly covered up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness is rising, even if there has been a tense situation, it should have arrived.
According to information from the judicial authority, 21 posts are not occupied in Tegel due to the shortage of young people, 19 are to be cancelled out in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy: "We are creating the"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
About 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year after the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany, has even been able to include a million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) demonstrates, given the unusual challenge, 'I say again and again: We can do that and we are creating that'.
What happens to Germany gives the following overview.
It is possible that, according to various forecasts, between 350000 (estimate by the Federal Ministry of Development) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel-Institut) housing annually - and the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as up to now (250000 flats).
The lack of housing, however, is mainly due to affordable rental properties: Each year, 60 000 to 80 000 social housing falls out of rental prices, and they will also be able to apply for refugees.
The Federal Republic of Germany, Barbara Hendricks (SPD), therefore wants to double the promotion, from now EUR 518 million to EUR 1 billion.
Far too little is that from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing costs would have to be incurred each year, and the federal government would have to invest the amount of EUR 6.4 billion per year.
In conclusion, scientists and Federal Republic of Germany agree that there must also be more fiscal advantages for investment in housing.
According to the Institute's estimates of employment and professional research, it should be assumed that 55% of the people in Germany could have a long-term employment status.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications, in order to help them get started, criticised Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, for the integration of refugees, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for consideration in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migrant researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Threlhardt, there has been a political change, from the ban on the death of refugees to recognition of work.
While there was previously an employment ban on the provision of asylum seekers from up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residency obligation to restrict asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - the majority view is that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge.
So far, there has not been a sufficient supply of general and professional-language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contact.
The building of networks is therefore, in the view of Thränhardt the Royal Way to Work Integration.
The Berlin School Management has noted that only a few people who have fled to the kitten are estimated to give birth to their children, estimated to be ten to 15%, "said Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for Youth and the Family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
However, in order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration of handbooks is distributed in different languages.
If the need for educators by the large number of refugees is growing rapidly, the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - for example, by allowing for more vocational schools.
In the countries, students with no knowledge of German are prepared in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, like in Berlin, also by teachers, who only have qualifications in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from Berlin School Management.
The German Student Works has estimated that some 20% of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no federal state is forbidden to study or wait for the studies - the only exception has been Berlin, Innensenator Frank Henkel (CDU) but abandoned its attitude.
Student-willing refugees could be made easier access to university.
The fact that refugees with a residence permit or toleration does not receive any benefits under the law on asylum seekers if they are going to study.
The latter do not receive any Bafög in principle, since they are not part of the circle of eligible residents.
Patient suffering refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible to pay Bafög and from 1 January 2016 to 15 months.
This funding gap must also be closed, however, called Steffen Krach, Berlin State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
The students should receive Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state-of-church right to a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare federation, which would be professionally concerned with the new arrivals.
Rights include obligations.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control measures.
This also requires a willingness to proceed with courage on religious fundamentalism.
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered in Germany.
Those who wanted to arrest such conflicts in Germany, "they immediately had their right to be here, in Germany," he said in the Bavarian broadcasting industry.
He proposed that the constitution be translated to Arabic.
In the future, integration will be far more than an issue for the whole of society.
In order to do this, the majority society will also have to change the way in which discrimination and racism are dismantled.
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has, for a short decade, been an anti-discrimination area and a general law on equality.
However, it learns very slowly, like the NSU murders, in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: With regard to immigrant organisations and non-white Germans, for which international agreements such as the anti-racism convention, Germany, are required, the reality will become reality in the coming years, if the country is to remain peaceful and to use its new citizens' opportunities for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany will be able to provide medical care to the refugees who have been expected to date.
"What we are talking about - power and capacity," he said, "he said the day-to-day mirror.
However, additional money must be invested into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls on all arrivals to collect health cards immediately on registration.
Such services may be invoiced later with the federal states.
In the long run, however, it would be highly questionable to cover so many people with the limited-value catalogue that the asylum-seeker-claim law prescribes.
Otherwise, doctors, in particular, will be creating language barriers.
Even so far, the Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has identified migrants with poor knowledge of their diseases than other patients.
It does not only apply in hospitals, even in doctors' practices, for interpreting costs.
However, many refugees would already have more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are considerably more untreated disability, and for young people it is about providing information about HIV.
However, in some cases, German doctors were aware of the fact that they had become aware of the fact that they had been trained by Montgomery.
"Parasites or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize," and, as far as doctors are concerned, the refugees may even have relief in sight.
The Syrians would have a sophisticated education system, including a number of refugees, including doctors.
In order to exercise practice, however, they should have proof of their qualifications and may be subject to checks.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill-advised by the Federal Institute of Health Therapy (BPtK), most of whom suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK.
A recent study by the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatised in Germany.
Those who suffer from a posttraumatic stress disorder, among other things, are suffering from so-called Flashbacks with respiratory problems, cheating, heart attacks, and death fears.
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong fearfulness, and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment required Munz.
However, only four per cent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum seekers in social councils may submit a request for psychotherapy, the processing usually takes several months.
Moreover, in social service departments or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses, it would be necessary to decide whether or not the therapy would be necessary.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream a dream.
With the new staging "passion," Circus Probst takes on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract attention to every age group of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
The Circus Probst is now inviting you to the manege on the brick wall for dreams.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I cannot imagine to live without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, an animal teacher and a junior.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current exhibition design.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family.
The body is thus inspired by the family in blood.
"It is important for us to get rid of the people of their everyday life and take them out for two hours in a completely different world," says the 27-year-old Junior Junior.
"Personal cocktail with the world-city flair," director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the 3 000 kilometres of tour can experience this flair now.
The program of the circus is convincing with talented artists from around the world.
Awarded with the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts audiences with a sense of humour and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the hero of the silent films, the Cuban Duo has a relaxed record.
Ease and mobility - with these words, they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is intended to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus also fascinates with sensitivity and sensitivity.
To balance a ball on a ball?
For He Yuan no problem.
It fascinates and frightens the people at the same time.
Wang Lin is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics.
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," says Stephanies Mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuses in the attitude of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also makes a statement. "It is not good for our animals, it is not good for us."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-legged artist," as they are affectionately called, will be left as soon as possible.
We want to cooperate with the animals and have fun with them.
If the pet is not sure, then it doesn't want to go into the manege.
So the top commandment: Good for the animals.
Especially on their zebroid jellyfish, a mixture of a Shetland ponyhengst and a zebra, the Probst family is proud.
Both animals have lived for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, was our small Jumbo da," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So it seems to be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always give our best and with all our hearts."
The Circus Probst invites you from 17 to 20 September a day at 17 and 8 p.m.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 16 pm.
Thursday is the family day, for the presentation at 17 o'clock, the prices are discounted.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 to 18 o'clock.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained unattended, but the video of the case spread quickly through the social media.
Parliament's opening has also been tempered by allegations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them that they had been warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech.
Last month, they had overrun it and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - that is what he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opinion polls have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned Mr Mugabe's address.
"The message comes from a number not displayed, but she has the title 'death'," he said, after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members of parliament concerned that immunity in Parliament ends, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesperson said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "worried" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard is expected to generate 25,000-30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will later share in two publicly traded companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service business.
The expected job losses result in a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow for a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who is supposed to lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise is smaller and more focused than it is HP today, and we have a broad and deepened portfolio of stores that support companies in transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As independent company we are better placed than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion dollars of annual sales and "will focus on delivering previously unrealised, integrated technology solutions for companies," a statement from the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electric devices and whose Palo Alto Garage was named "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone massive restructuring to overcome the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action of HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US-Tech companies, is the latest in this field, which is based on the conviction that close-focused companies are performing better.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that team colleagues need to be ahead of the match against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere.
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it was only September and, if his rehabilitation was carried out according to plan, there was no reason why he could not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss the next four games for England, and in the face of its history, its participation will certainly remain uncertain next summer.
The great shame on this latest issue is that Wilshere had stopped the last season after a separate ankle injury and then recovered its old momentum during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the careers," said Wenger.
It is a bone that does not heal properly.
This is not a bigger issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in combination with his ankle or with the injuries he had previously.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but, like Wenger, there are also the associated risk of other injuries, whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study by Premier injuries Ltd has 23 different diseases from Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 League games during the last five times.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of 2007 / 08, most of which have been subjected to injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from injury, you have a period of time, a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win combat," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome it.
I hope that his body stabilises, I am confident he will do it and he will undergo a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts its Champions-League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger represents a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will start.
Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players who need to give a little delay," said Wenger.
Although arsenal is clear, through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the venues with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also available after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake, measured by 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal won the lesson from the last season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains from the distant hope that it will lead the club to its first Europapokal-Triumph.
"The drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked out of Arsenal.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand I am long enough in the business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not a dreamer.
FriendsFest: The comedy show, which gives us serious lessons on men's friendships.
The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up, now even more desperate than ever before, how suicide rates on a 15-year high are proving to be suicides.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death among men aged between 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and there are three times more often than women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of challenging the culture of men from seeking help when they need them.
Friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge.
An up-to-date study of more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends, so that friendship can work.
In the era of communication conducted via social media, with its emphasis on the substance of substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong, life-saving and successful, even though in reality the isolation is dominated.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call it's indistinguishable values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a profound impact on our mental health.
And like a video game inventor and billionaire recently, money can definitely not buy money.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was on the head.
Every character has not been defined by his work, but by his personality, which was characterised by interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs, moments at the football look in cosy armchairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can certainly relate to them, even though they often hold back to explore completely their feelings.
Like an employee of the telephone guard, she told me:... "my audience's role for people who feel depressed and self-disillusioned, gave me real evidence of how even the smallest interactions of friends could make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying "I am coping with it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems. "
Friends is one of the shows that makes sense when I try to provide longer-term relief mechanisms.
It presents the small moments of men's friends.
So much my objective outsider status on the telephone people may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit this weekend comedy Central FriendsFest with that at the celebration of the day completely redesigned, why do you not have your friends to have a drink in Central Perk.
Or, better if you see Starbucks someone alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might be.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria met to help PSG to break Malmö.
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to advance to Malmö.
This is the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held the course, when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Maria came out less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who launched the French champion, but then missed a number of occasions before she finally increased her lead, when Cavani reached a headball in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as it does not only aim to qualify for the rounds, but also an improvement on the quarter of the last three campaigns.
But at the same time it was not a class game by Laurent Blancs's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics lost opportunities in front of the door, later in the game against his hometown team and against the club, with whom he started his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2-0, to cause problems and to be relaxed, even though there are certain things that we need to perfect for the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not reach one or two other goals. '
When he was injured in one of three changes to the Paris team, he returned to the Paris team at the end of the weekend, but he was killed in the First League at the fourth minute in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wyvern was called the man who could take the PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United, and he indicated why, when he went to the Marseilles-Defense in Marco Verrattis Pass, he took over to Johan Wiland over the long distance from the network.
However, if anyone thought that PSG would achieve a great victory, that was a disappointment.
Malmö, which hit Celtic in a play-off in order to reach this stage, was on the field with nine national players at Anpiff, with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle of the middle field.
But besides a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far to Kevin's tips in the 34th minute, they offered little effort.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up itself, with some failures and bad conclusions, not least of Ibrahim himovic, who had no fewer than five experiments carried out in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had deployed it after the relaunch.
However, he performed much more when he put his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahim himovic, who transformed the Di Maria into a shooting shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post...
The second gate was finally reached shortly after the hour mark, thanks to Cavani.
This ended all thinking that Malmö could return to the battlefield, and only an excellent intervention by Wilund from just a short distance to stop David Luiz, the end result could be low, before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi had a gate at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG was a class of his team, and the Norwegians said: "Our last Champions-League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
Qualification games are not enough. "
Hats off from Paris!
It was a great game of them!

London's Glencore company, Glencore, said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion £in order to pay off its own debts.

The shares jumped from 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which increased 0.69% higher.
Glencore had announced the $2.5 billion stock market share last week as part of the broader plans to pay around one-third of its $30 billion dollars.
The company sold the new shares to 125 Pence per share, which resulted in a 2.4% discount on the closing course on Tuesday.

Xavi: PEP Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern.
World and European champions Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015.
A few years ago, the FC Bayern were faced with a commitment from Spain's Superstar Xavi, who was playing at the time for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish Masters, three times champions, four times Champions League winners, two times World Champions, two times European champions, one time world champions, the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old, after 24 years, left the FC Barcelona and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
However, in an interview with the Marca Xavi now betrays Xavi that he was already ahead of the Euro 2008 prior to the departure from Barcelona.
"You told me that Barca wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, nothing," he told us.
And the FC Bayern also registered as well.
Xavi: "There was an offer of Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me to."
As a reminder, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern in the summer of 2008.
Draola was the reason that Xavi did not change
However, the change did not occur.
And the most important man today works for the German record master: PEP Guardiola.
Xavi explained why: "Barça has contracted Guardiola and I have played a great EM."
"PEP told me that I would not change that he was not able to imagine the team without me."
"He has he got me."
Who knows how Bavaria's season 2008 / 2009 would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the full distance on the pitch, he left the Red out (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated the premier class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays diversity in the film industry.
Matt Damon challenged the Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity and said that she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night of HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown collapsed when it emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, referring to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do so at the recording of the film and not in the recording of the show," Damon asserted.
Brown responded shocked, with insulted unbelief and called "Hoo! WoW" okay, "when the commentaries of the actor from The Martian were strong.
Damon and Brown closed the producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers in order to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to call on people to think about - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony," Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a Nutte who is beaten by her white pint.
The producer of Dear White People stood for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing-rights in the film; Damon replied that the directing "at the end could give us something that we do not want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the Social Media exploded over Dama's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni put his anger on the clip by writing "Matt Damon talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain its diversity - that is SO WEISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 Retseets and 4,000 Likes since its release.
Damins's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
When the teenager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police force, the Black Lives' movement achieved national effect and urged legislators and authorities to put a stop to discriminatory practices against colour.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the Year Award for the Grammy Awards.
"Album silent week," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, even albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of movement Black Lives Matter published a statement in response to the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Network Black Lives Matter is a love group," said the leaders.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior 'praises first Champion
Pro-sport climbers and operator guidance Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and won the Grand Prix $1 Million.
The competition show, which just completed her 7th season, had never experienced a competitor participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season, there were two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, until the final.
The climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope was part of 30 seconds.
At the end of the Second World War, he was the first athlete to be the first athlete to finish the arduous phase 4 of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero completed this challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard-won victory, still falling under the shock of the $1 Million Grand Prix.
"I think it's amazing to think about it, I've never deserved more than $10,000," said Isaac E!
So suddenly.. how I can not even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
With The Hollywood Reporter, the leading producer Kent Weed took part in discussing the final, and why did Britten, even though he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"When there are more than one finalists, it gets the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful prize and life changed, it gets the great gratification.
I do not think he has any qualms about that.
He has just been so happy with what he has done.
Masses of awards received from fans.
He is a great guy and a father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I should be beaten by someone, I am glad that it is Isaac."
And I think that Isaac would have felt the same if she had lost the reels.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit's Tigers of Minnesota Twins's End
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once again, they were one of the best teams in baseball, and today the Tigers are at the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers have been reduced to their role as spoiler, but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Twins 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins lost an opportunity to climb in a slot of Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard-Platz.
For Detroit, if only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word, which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories make fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two and then again in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in 1 / 3 Innings and allowed three Runs.
It was his third successful start in his last nine matches.
"I want to close this year," said Simon.
It is difficult to throw in the bullers of any game, and so I want to focus on the game.
The designer tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two Runs, his first rbis since mid-August.
It was the first three-stroke hit of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He has a good pivot," she said.
It looked good at (jumping), saw much better in the bulldog, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three races in the end of the seventh Innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Field of the Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left line.
Right in the footsteps of Aaron Hicks, Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to Strikeout, before he was replaced by the left-wing Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran a wall, the only man he faced, before the Rookie-drummer Miguel Sano, who tore a two-run out of the square Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the end-run of the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a Double Play.
It was in the Major League leader 27 times in this season that Plouffe had a Double Play beat.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the 9th Innings, a RBI double broke out the Close of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and achieved the status of 5-4.
However, the law firm, Sano, was at three pitches for its fifth Save.
Detroit profits for the launch of the game from an unmovable Phil Hughes.
The Tigers achieved three of us in the first two sessions against the right-wing veterans, who had been removed from the list of casualties before the game, having lost more than one month because of a back rest.
"Obviously not the beginning that I wanted to do," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches in the third place."
After having received the Leadoff-Batter in the first hand, Hlashes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play that made a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the Runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right-hand side, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third, causing the threat.
In the second, the Tigers achieved a One-Out Double from Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out single from the Center-Fiels Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"This was a great blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He was not particularly well beaten, but he missed the right place.
Hughes was in a Pitch-Count, scored no points in the third inning, before he was replaced by the relic status A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three Runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
Notes: Tiger RHP Anibal Sanchez departed for injury to the breeders.
He is studied by Dr. James Andrews, who performed the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injury list because of a shoulder strap, will be activated on Wednesday.
Using Sanchez from the game, LHP will delete Daniel Morris from the Deficit List to launch against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four launch with the tiger, since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July
It has been missing since August 20 because of a rage in the right of the hips.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games on the Target Field on Wednesday.

Hundreds of refugees are to be carried out in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
Its arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
They will then be housed in temporary shelters in Wiesbaden, such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening.
They equated with 450 to 750 upcoming refugees.
Over the past few days in the past days, several sports halls of the famous capital city have been prepared for this case.
Up to 1000 refugees may be temporarily absent there.
They will then be extended to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the Governing Council of the Board responsible for the first recording, 7500 people have arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau also have emergency accommodation in sports halls due to the large numbers of refugees.
Caucasus: German military action in Syria
The director of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Schoinger, holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility.
"I believe that decisive consideration for military action options must not take place without Germany '," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective roadways."
Four years ago, one would have been glad that the Kelch had passed a military presence in Germany.
"Now the conflict is running out in front of our door," he said in the German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for refugees.
Austria controls the Southern and Eastern Limits
After Germany, Austria has also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Interior Minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, declared on Tuesday evening at the Austrian television station ORF, after Hungary no one was sent back.
Germany, too, has sent no refugees to Austria.
"No, it is so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement whereby Germany could host a certain number of refugees from Austria on a daily basis, Mikl Leitner said that there have already been talks on this matter between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
Concrete figures did not mention it and pointed to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria on the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State or Government, asked for a special summit next week.
Germany had begun temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU Member States have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis.
The EU's Ministers for Home Affairs want, on the next Tuesday (22 September), a new attempt at the mandatory distribution of another 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee situation in Germany, the Confederation wants to give more support to countries in the former reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Chancellor Merkel, at the end of the day, has announced almost four-minute talks with the Prime Minister in Berlin on the late Tuesday evening.
Merkel pointed out that those people who need protection would receive them.
But if you don't have a lead view, you cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The German Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "huge effort."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
In the night of Tuesday, Hungary closed its 175 mile long border with Serbia.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced the border with a fence on the border with Romania.
This neighbouring country, unlike Serbia, is part of the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking evasive routes across Romania, said Hungary's Minister for Foreign Affairs Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who cut the fence.
In Turkey, there have been eyewitness reports that thousands of migrants are entering the Greek border on the way to Greece.
Room sonde "Cassini" will find ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus.
Under the ice cream of Saturnmond Enceladus, a global ocean swapping.
This will close researchers from observations made by the "Cassini" spacers.
So the moon could be easily switched on its train around the ring planks.
However, although it is only small, but still too large for a permanent celestial body, it is stated in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State of New York).
The researchers present their analyses in the "Icarus" specialist sheet.
For a long time, it was known that there had to be water under the ice ceiling of Enceladus fluid.
For example, "Cassini" had already discovered Ice volcanoes on the South Pole of Saturnmond in 2006, water vapour and ice particles, and thus the so-called E-Ring of Saturn.
At least in the South Pole there had to be an underground sea.
However, the spread of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama was missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to do without a month, due to open-minded actresses Valdet Rama.
A survey carried out an induction injury at the 27-year-olds, shared the association.
Rama had suffered pain as early as the week.
According to Munich lions, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of forced break."
"This is difficult for us, Rama is a herover loss."

Already on Thursday the Austrian national player gets into the running training.
Okotie had a heavy collision with Fortuna Düsseldorf (0: 3).
Despite initial fears, however, he remained without a serious blurring.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain much sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But if you want to pay attention to its slim line, you will often be discouraged.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
Healthy are the exotic fruits, in fact, B vitamins and vitamins E and C. above all contain mangoes but a lot of vitamin A and its pre-level Beta-Karotin.
Those who eat the fruits also support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When it comes to purchase, mangoes should not be too soft or dull and pleasant.
The mould colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is, so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days.
Then you can taste pure pure or sweet food.
A mango, however, gives a special touch to hearty dishes.
It supplements the slightly bitter taste of some of the pieces like Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney suits well to fish, poultry, lamb and game.

On Thursday afternoon and during the night on Thursday, there will be lots of rain.
After settling on Thursday morning, there will be a marked cold front with heavy rains, wind turbines and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of a large-scale low-pressure area above the British Isles in a strong southwest flow.
On the opposite side of the Alps, there is a cross-section of the Alps.
In the aftermath, the hair dryer up to Thursday morning blows from 60 to 100 km / h, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland with more than 100 km / h.

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city President Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday, a previously nameless square in the park on the Oppio Hill was baptized on the German reform's name.
The "Piazza Martin Lutero" is now recognized as the "German theologian of the Reformation."
The park is located in the middle of old Rome, just beside the Coliseum.
The name was requested by the Evangelical Church of the Evangelical Church in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes, for centuries as a minority, were often only hidden in secret.
With the square, there is symbolic evidence that the traditions of the Christian faith in Rome are welcome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) held several months in Rome at the turn of 1510 / 11.
At that time, the city was considered to be a fancy scapegoat.
His negative impressions should, in his view, have been reinforced by historians in his later struggle against Rome.
At the end of the Second World War, the city was the largest city in Central America.
Master Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) Dornenkrone is one of the main works painted by Otmar Alt for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not on the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now been released with magnificent images.
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, which in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colours and imaginative shapes has received the 75-year-old - but that doesn't mean "funny" images.
On the contrary, it may well be quite dark in terms of their respective themes.
For three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he met a subjective artistic choice from the many themes of the book book of all books.
There are cycles that focus on subjects such as cross-roads, posts, bids, or paternity.
In doing so, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: The Luther publishing house, with its theological orientation and the Kettler-Verlag with its main focus on art books.
And, above all, there is the author Klaus Altepost, who has studied painting with the respective Bible.
It has interpreted the Bible, selected by Otmar Alt, and thus translated into today's context "translated."
These texts are like verbal mirrors from Alts painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotation from Martin Luther and a set of the artist himself, who gives his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry book has golden digits.
This allows the 75-year-olds to have a deep insight into his soul and emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project. Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode, was born in Wernigerode and grew up in Berlin, coming from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant ruling Order.
"Since the education has already happened with the pipe," Otmar Alt remembers.
"I tried to work on it, so that I could perhaps meet him again with the Lord."
His second concern is to restore more importance to art in the near future: "The perception of picture worlds is today of publicity, and that is loud.
Symbolism is being pushed aside.
Artists have a different desire and laughter to show things.
Images always have something secret and are not decorative.
'in this respect, I am a dinosaur '.
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to appear in the images, to appear, discover and feel the power they have: "The image looks for its counterpart."
Klaus Altepost worked on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "always" a lover of Otmar Alts art had been "always" a lover of Otmar Alts "art," I like, "I like him how he works with his images."
Old people didn't care to fully understand the Bible, but chose the themes that are important to him, including mysterious themes.
"It was not a cooperation on equal terms," says Altepost: "This is about the images, the text explains only."
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and to find freedom."
Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love as well as that of responsibility.
Part of the original paper - paper and picture quality - is presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation.
Building commencement for BMX rail is approaching.
Plans are found, placed in place, placed on the ground for a round course, and one year later, almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BMX rail system was already in the end.
The failure in politics and administration resulted in the disappearance of the railways, especially among those in favour of the railways.
So there was a new location on top of the hill - now with formal planning and application for permission.
In October, the First Local Committee, Sabine Mosebach, has now been able to communicate to the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year will be visible," she said.
There should be no "further reflection" with the work on the former indoor swimming pool.
DFB's Global Humanitarian Aid for Refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga will send a strong signal on the weekend.
The football has responded to the worsening situation in Germany and, at the same time, it secures its help in coping with the problems facing us.
"I consider this to be the greatest challenge of our country since reunification."
"There is nothing I can do about this in principle."
"It is important for everyone to be interested in getting to grips with this issue," said DFB-Chief Wolfgang Amorsbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am the Chancellor and I will meet the Minister of State, Mrs Özğuz and the Chancellor next Wednesday.
"The issue will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football could and should help.
The decisive steps, however, must be the policy.
Therefore, the German Football League has extended its Refugee Initiative "1: 0 for a Welcome" by four years.
"Above the Egidius-Braun-Foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019," he explained, at the margins of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's / Malta.
Some of the German Federal Democrats are also supporting this programme.
As early as this weekend, the 36 professional associations will be sending out a strong signal when they wear on the left front panel instead of the usual sponsorship logo (Hermes).
"We want to make it clear that everyone is supposed to help, where and how they can only be able to" said Leverkusens sports director Rudi Völler, the "Picture" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as a "obvious thing."
"The refugee drama affects everyone, no one can be seen."
"We have football, no, we must use our power, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Henthheims Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent character of the league."
At the time of the Euro-Qualifications against Hungary on this Friday, the national team of 100 refugees will be invited to Halle / Saale.
He described the support of refugees as "a large association of German football."
The fact that all 36 licensing clubs had started their own projects in their own places is great.
It is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active.
The "1: 0 for a Welcome" message will be used in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the federal government, provides EUR 300 000 annually for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already made available the total amount for 2015," he reported.
Reports: SAP's Chief Executive loses an eye on an accident in the event of an accident.
The Chief Executive of Europe's largest software corporation, Bill McDermott, has reported several reports to lose sight of the left eye at the beginning of July.
In the case of the accident at the foot of his brother's house in the US, after midnight on a water glass he was wearing in the left hand, the "Wirtschaftswoche" was on Wednesday.
"It has almost faded out, was powerless, then went out on the road - as he told us this week," cited the "WiWhere" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott, however, could do his job.
"At the beginning of October, we met in Walldorf at the meeting of the Supervisory Board meeting," Plattner said.
The 54-year old manager was "fully operational."
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue the software group.
"I am fully behind for SAP, full in my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his chairman Hasso Plattner," said McDermott the "SZ."
McDermott usually oscillates between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It's important to go to the public with such a personal history, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can take this kind of thing."
"It's important to be back if you like it."
McLaren and Renault for the Bahrain Grand Prix...
Magnets have a similar photo and explained that he was injured when he was overthrown by the wheel.
So, when he left Singapore at the end of the weekend, he also questioned the reservations of his two chief figures Fernando Alonso and Lewis Button, just like one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BvB without Reus on Krasnodar: Weidenfeller im Tor
At Borussia Dortmund, all the hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group of the Europe League League will finally be broken.
The national player will also be absent from the football league table leader in the match with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7.00 p.m. / Sky).
"We can't resort to it," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
The BVB-coach left the BVB-coach openly: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday '.
Given the high load of its professionals, Tuchel will not only change its trunk position on the Reus position.
So he announced a change on the goalkeeper's position.
Therefore, Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keepers novel Bürki.
"He trained at an absolute top level," the soccer teacher praised the world champion.
However, Tuchel was open to the men in the future in all the European League games.
With a high probability, he will pay the second match.
The main feature of the tournament is that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League must be the same as the middle level player Julian Weigl considers it to be clear: "It is not so false that Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance of starting off the title."
Robot Cars: Government wants to lead the way for Germany
Germany, according to the Federal Government, is supposed to be a pioneer in the transformation of the car.
The Bundeskabinett decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the European Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides, among other things, investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Automesse IAA from a "new mobility age."
Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams, said Dobrindt.
He also intends to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, which are also meeting with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's policy paper emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and the rapid changeover to digital radio.
For testing new technology there is currently a test route on the 9 in Bavaria.
In order to avoid additional liability risks, the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments.
Germany, for example, wants to ensure that the maximum permissible speed limit for self-driving cars is increased from 10% to 130 km / h.
The Federal Government also wishes to commit itself to changing the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for the people to be a driver.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is based above all on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automatic driving on motorways by 2020 will be technically possible.
Nonetheless, dripping vehicles on public roads will be "far beyond 2020."
The value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and high-automated driving functions at the German location Germany appreciates the authors of the study for 2025 to around EUR 8.4 billion.
"The digital networking of passenger cars may lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said the Social Democrat Transport Minister Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the driver's personal data must be clearly clarified.
Yet the German self-driving cars still see scepticism - much more than French or American.
On a Wednesday at the AA presented survey of the Forsa Institute on the Order of the Forsa Institute, on the basis that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years, 32% will only rise in 20 years, 31 per cent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21% of the respondents had self-propelled cars by 2025, 33% in the US.
In Germany, the car drivers in Germany are still not ready to leave completely on a self-drive vehicle.
After a survey by the Digital Association Bitkom, only seven per cent would agree to take control over the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway, there could be 15% in the flow of traffic, in the Stau 45%.
Well, any Vulated would under no circumstances be left to the car.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis-EM.
From 25 September to 4 October, the end of the year 2010 will be only available in a single listing.
The final decision will be taken at the latest on 22nd of September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The guys know about it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to bring the title even without Timo," said German singer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM-course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was at that time on the flight to a long-term sponsorship event in China.
The 34-year old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo is the drawback, we are no longer such a clear favorite," single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the betting list in Jekaterinburg, but also reminded the EM-2013 in Schwechat.
"Then Timo also lacked it, and we have become a European champion."
"We should be guided by this", "said the world-ranking-fifth.
The British football champion Luke Shaw of Manchester United has caught a severe injury on the right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was met with a Tackling of Héctor Moreno and changed after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis, during the 20-year-old players from Bastian pigs, indicated a rail crash.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant.
It is a mixture of a great fashion show and a wax figurehole: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on the Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights include shovel blades, which, thanks to video projections, look to be frightening human.
They carry out the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, made Madonnas stage outfits the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in Röcke.
"I can no longer say that I am the Enfant terrible of Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"Earlier it was easy, now it is real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from the sidewalk to the catwalk), which will be seen on 18 September at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo Cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion maker has changed his initial negative attitude towards a show of his person.
Actually he was against because: "For me sound an exhibition a bit after death," he said.
If you die, you will get to the Museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris stations.
"It's about so much more than beautiful dresses," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever-thought-out work of man, which has written fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed whole artwork, for which a lot of effort has been made: For example, to fresher the dolls, for example, a stylist has been made.
According to information published by the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material are carp.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was another special delicacy: A leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are slightly different, said Gaultier.
Even Gaultiers old teddy can be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, timid, timepieces of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good pupil and bad in football) he attracted his Teddy BHs and dresses, said Gaultier.
Playing a doll would not have allowed him.
He later helped to throw fashion out of fashion.
He steel fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, such as Gaultier in Munich.
Later on, however, I bought them naturally.
For his first own fashion show he didn't have to pay the models.
They had nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Just as Fashion Nic
In the past it was on the long range of embroidery machines in and around the clock.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers, which, for example, have been further processed with ceilings and yarns.
That alone no longer works, says Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the mosquitters.
Instead, fashion is again important.
Playing a greater role in the early days of the conversation, the home textile industry was then pushed out of the way, and has now been rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt describes some examples: Top in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
Even the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past styles, is a growing potential.
Those who do not use niches in the textile sector in Germany are no longer in the market.
With us, they already account for half of the orders.
In cooperation with nine other companies, they chat with nine other companies in the industry association of Speakers and Stickereien.
Only they can carry the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, around 80% of sales have broken down.
Private shops and wholesale stores are almost no more.
Our products reach the customers in this way.
Today, mass goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and are driven almost exclusively by chains.
Moreover, exports to Russia and the US are weakening.
So there are enough reasons for new ways of doing so.
The industry association also tries to focus on issues such as Cordula Bauer in Falkenstein, which explains: "This year we have had a quality mark showing that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable products."
Reinhardt supplements: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diploma-designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the Lower Saxony University of Applied Sciences at the Faculty of Applied Art - specializing in embroidery and lace.
To counter competition from Asia, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is an area of tension between the new ideas of the designers and the companies, which, in particular, must think economically, "says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design often varies easily in order to be a customer base.
A few years ago, the textile designer Kati Reuter relaunched the historic snowball.
In doing so, the machine plays small chests in a few places.
The famous golfer's enthusiasm for Bianca Hallebach was inspired: "I couldn't get started with a traditional conversation."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewellery.
In an elaborate procedure, she shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of chat, young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - mostly to customers whose ancestors lived in chat and environment.
In this way, I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the conversation.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends may not be touched, but Disney prefers a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins."
However, according to "Entertainment Weekly" it is not a matter of re-filming, but a kind of continuing, the 20 years after the first movie with the magical nanny.
It is about the experience of the Nanny with the Family Banks in times of global economic crisis.
Anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director already stands: Rob Marshall, most recently with Into the Woods in the cinema.
XI urges the economy wider for the world to open up.
The economy needs to open wider to the outside in order to promote growth, says President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group charged with the reform of the reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving the strategies for business start-ups," he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Opening-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality, and create new ground for economic growth, said Xi.
The ruling group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of rules on market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), including private capital, and an overhaul of the population reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is drawn up which identifies sectors and companies that do not qualify for investment.
The system will be tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important, as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, guaranteeing a rule of law business environment and opening the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also exercise control over the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new cross-border economic cooperation models and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In a bid to open up government-controlled sectors, further sectors are being opened up for private investment.
'the government will not change its policy vis-à-vis foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financed companies and provide better services to them, "said the statement.
Furthermore, it makes it easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or Green Card by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to practise their activities and use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a session.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double the mercury limit in predators.
The European Commission would like to double the limit values for mercury in large pirates and to give consumers a much higher dose of nerve reward.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has an appropriate working paper from the EU, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and side-effects of malevolent industrial and environmental policies are extended with full force of pregnant women and small children," Matthias Wolfschmidt explained by Foodwatch.
According to Mr Schmidt, the limits of nerve poisoning for large-scale fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, for "economic reasons," are increased from one to two milligrams of fish per kilogram of fish.
Large predators are, however, heavily burdened with mercury today that around 50% of the catch-up limit cannot be sold on the basis of the current limit values.
After doubling the limit values, then only 14.5% would be unsold.
In exchange for this easing, the EU, according to Foodwatch, wants to tighten up the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch called it "trick," because smaller gravefish, such as carp, are often so low that they are already complying with the planned maximum values.
The reduction in the small-scale reduction is therefore "a perfile of distraction, which helps the economy alone," explains Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for the people, which, above all, is heavily enriched by the food chain, particularly in predators.
The federal government therefore warns that 'already small quantities can cause especially harm to the unborn skin of the nervous system'.
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection explains, on its homepage with regard to the maximum levels, that a "health hazard for the general population" should not be expected.
Mercury comes first and foremost in the environment through coal combustion.
The German coal-fired power stations emit more than six tonnes of mercury per year, according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, with two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe, Rhine and Danube is "permanently and permanently exceeded," the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
Foodwatch calls on consumers to protest against the EU's plans at: Www.mercury.
