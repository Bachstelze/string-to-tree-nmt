Reverting to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The Congressman Keith Ellison and John Lewis put forward a legislative proposal in order to establish the organization of trade unions as citizen's right.
"Just as unions are dying, the middle-class jobs are also dying," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and vice-chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud, together with the Civil Rights Court, John Lewis, the law enforcement law.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal means of discrimination on the basis of the organisation of unions and other forms of discrimination - and stops so anti-union forces.
The supplement of the National Labour Law Act, in order to establish an opportunity for discrimination against displaced workers for the organisation of a trade union representation, in order to take legal action against a civil court for justice - and for compensation or punishment - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it certainly is not a radical initiative - certainly not American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of her legislative proposal suggests, is the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks suffered by trade unions in the last few years, in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states throughout the country, Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and maintain labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and the right of freedom of association.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarised autocracy, Hedki Tojos, was replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions have a role in building a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers in association and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism replaced Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers should have to organise themselves and make their voices heard in the new nation, the Germans added a clause explicitly stating: 'The right to establish associations to ensure and improve the working and economic conditions of each individual and every profession or business.
Agreements that limit or aim to reduce this right are null and void; they are illegal and are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Council, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948, as a global agreement, Roosevelt and other authors set a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions in order to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When that country rallied to other countries, how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and for that union to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government bodies - was to be protected.
After these rights in America came under attack, it is true that the American ideal should be remembered that the working population must have the right to join and be heard in a free and open society.
Like Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now we all know that the workers' movement has not reduced the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has admirably created a market for industry and the entire nation increased on unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History is a reminder, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made great in the past, and the promise of democracy.
Judges Stop temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana may force them to be closed.
A US federal judge on Sunday, on Sunday, stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, a lawyer saying that it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion hospitals of the state.
This measure, which was put into practice by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June in order to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out abortions to acquire a patient receipt law with a hospital within 30 miles of 30-mile limit.
The decision of the judge, however, means that the doctors will continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being, while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs are able to continue working under the rule of law as they seek to obtain these rights," Federal magistrates wrote John degravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, there will be a hearing for the judges to make the law more permanent.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a number of judgments against similar measures, and said that doctors took so more time to gain hospital approval rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana avoid a bad law that wants to take care of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproduction Right, which, in the name of three of the five hospitals of the state, took the law to halt the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also stretched out to the doctors of the two clinics, who did not follow the complaint and have also applied for permission.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and has recently declared such action in Alabama and Mississippi for non-constitutional.
Key offices of a Texas law, which would have forced most of the hospitals in the state to be closed down, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, are united in saying that doctors' rights will demand unnecessary restrictions.
Anti-abortion opponents believe that the measures are intended to protect the health of women, even though some of them also welcome the effects of closing hospitals.
Only a physician who performs abortions carried out in Louisiana has a patient, who has the centre for reproductive rights.
If all the other doctors in the country are forced to do no more abortions, this doctor would no longer carry out the operation because of fear for its safety.
In their arguments against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the conduct of abortion, while their requests for patients were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher mortality rates for egg cell cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James made a video clip online for her mother who died in 2007.
Women in rural areas of Australia have a higher risk of dying of egg cell cancer than for women in towns.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, where drug cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25% five years after diagnosis were still alive.
The research leader Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20% higher than those in urban areas.
Small STUDY: New drugs may slow down lung and egg cell cancer.
Researchers studied medical care for women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, the type of egg stock, existing precursors, and social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than those in urban areas.
Although the study did not study why women living outside of the city died more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan predicts late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as a possible factor.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services, in order to meet the distances, it proposed a strengthening of the service of one-headed doctors, in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women more with their homes and treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, resulted in a poor long-term survival rate for women in the egg cell cancer and highlighted the need for better treatment and precautionary policies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years, learned of the gold coast that it had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden Centres regret declining home-owned losses
The reduction in the number of house owners under the age of 35 could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year from garden centres, if today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products" after a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants, on average, spend 55% of the amount on their own homes.
The rise of people living in high-urban areas without gardens, the popular procedure, pre-gardens for parking, and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, estimated 5 billion £per year on sale.
In the metropolitan area of London, where the share of homeowners from 61 to 43% has fallen from 61 to 43%, the lowest expenditure for garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw their plants.
Guy Barter said: "Container-gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden trading by increasing home owners and economic prosperity from the late 1980 "s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather, due to unwarm weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Beast Tahirul Qadri, is continuing.
In the capital, Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators have ripped the state television channel PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from PTV buildings.
The channel gave its operation for about 40 minutes but now broadcasts again.
At the same time, around 3,000 demonstrators attempted to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away from them, they came with sticks and stones equipped with safety forces.
The police force the edges of the police force.
The demonstrators called for Sharifs to resign, but that is not the case.
The country's army, meanwhile, is calling for a political solution to the conflict 'without wasting time and using force.
After a meeting on Sunday evening, the military told: "The army has its role to ensure the security of the state."
The military has an important role in Pakistan, and has already become more frequent.
The opposition politician Imran Khan has accused Premier Sharif of having cheated on the parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests were escalating at the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to enter Sharifs Residenz.
Three people were killed.
Turkey ordered US diplomat for spy reports
The Turkish Foreign Office has ordered the UK's oldest US diplomats to visit a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Minister Bülent said that the US embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel, and the online magazine The Intercept, reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, shows that Turkey was a major activity area for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan played out the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report, which also targeted Ankara's most important secret service, made a much more angry reaction from the Turkish Government.
Warning strikes: Driver leaders face the consequences for commuters.
The federal government warning strike on Monday evening could also damage the passenger traffic in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The aircraft was scheduled for 18 to 21 o'clock in Germany, including district, regional and rail transport.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

Said the district chairman of the German Aerospace Center (GDL), Sven Schal, in Düsseldorf.
We expect a great deal to be done.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
The German Railway in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so that it was difficult to predict the consequences.
Police chief of Magaluf of Corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors issued evidence of extortion by police officers and staff of the city of Calvià on Friday.
Calvià's police officer at Calvià on the island of Mallorca was arrested for corruption charges of businessmen and barowners in the infamous Binge-Drinking-Hotspot Magaluf.
The main commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, has been arrested in custody following corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most bars and nightclubs are of Magaluf.
According to the Mallorca online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutor's office of the prosecutor for Indonesia's fight against corruption was presented on Friday evidence of extortion by police and staff of the city of Calvià.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption charges and were consulted with Navarro from a judge.
The national Spanish newspaper ABC reported that the angry night clubs of the night have said that cronyism of the authorities has a serious effect on their business.
"It is no longer a question of making money, it is about survival," said one of the businessmen.
Let our livelihoods come from the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing a 18-year-old British tourist who performed 24 men during a tour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to halt the irregular behaviour of alcohol-dependent holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-ridden Kneipp baths.
The Playhouse Club, where the hospital was held, was forced to close it for one year, while Playhouse and the pub pentour Organator Carlage jointly had to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is popular especially for young British tourists, is also known for a number of accidents involving alcohol consumption, including the "Balconing," where people jump from a balcony to another or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions impaired flights from Adelaide Airport.
The FRÜHLING has a winter surprise, with heavy lights and strong winds from Adelaide Airport.
On the evening until 9 p.m., more than 5% of the city fell to the city, after 6,6mm, which had already been cancelled at night.
The last precipitation was the result of a number of short, stormy Schauer, including a kiss which began shortly before 20 o'clock and was almost 4mm in about 10 minutes.
After last week's early dose spring, temperatures in the city rose to a maximum of 15.8 ° C.
The worst weather conditions may have led to the late arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to arrive shortly after 7.30 p.m. but was hit by a storm - a sudden change of wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to be launched.
At that time, wind power reached about 50 km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to run even during a second landing flight and eventually set off at around 20.40.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including a Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, on Tuesday, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted with possible spectacles.
Matthies is: "The highest time for a large relay.
In view of the specific technical advances that make our comfortable home into high-tech switchgear, our columnist Bernd Matthies stands out with a highly trusted electronic accessory.
While I write here, my view of the spiral cable connects the listener with the phone and I think that Boah, how retro is this?
But there is a thought: If the cables were not it would be possible to fly all the headphones in the house in a very short time, and that would be significantly more retro.
In any case, this applies to the ekeltronic (ekeltronic)?
No, typing errors: Electronic) sector the rule that the world's novelty today is the electric scrap of tomorrow is bought - outdated.
And, for example, if there is still a tube television in the living room, it simply says that television is fundamentally opposed.
Why these considerations?
Because the driving force of the Ifa on the radio tower this week again reminds us of absolute incompetence on electronics issues.
The Laie, who had previously been blinded by washing machine and CD players, does not even today understand the purpose of the devices, which will be dispersed with unvisible expert spree before it: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yes, do you go?
What is to be discussed with people who seem to be voluntarily expanding such Quark?
After all, for some 20 years, we have, for the most part, been concerned about the fact that we are supposed to link up the House.
In order for this to be re-ordered so that the fire alarm on the Maldives will tell you that it burns in the working room.
And would it not be wonderful if we left the office out of the air conditioning on our arrival...?
Yes, but this does require air conditioning.
But a dream soon will come true: We lift up our watch watch, say "Saugen!" - and at home goes on the vacuum cleaner.
Misleading.
Everything works on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods become blurred," raunt has an industry moderator, one can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam garer sends the weather report and the data glasses will show how long the pizza is still needed in the baking oven, and that's how long the pizza is still needed in the baking oven, because there is nothing else in the Stau.
Also, from day to day, we know that when a new modified device is really urgently needed, the battery will be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable will survive the next radio exhibitions on the phone.
After the Gaza war in Gaza, children's children are returning to their schools.
Thousands of Israeli children from the territories near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after having spent the summer in air-conditioning, while missile and mortar fire were on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools in Gaza were closed, while the area recovered from the battles.
The beginning of the school was a feeling of joy and expectation for communities in the south of Israel, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, a member of the "Pashosh" children's garden, which was hit by a rocket, before boarding the student grenade splitter came out of the walls and shovels.
"We have a bit of fear but are excited," said Ronit Bart, a friend in Kibbutz Saad and his English teacher.
Many of our region's children desperately need a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said she feels "a bit funny," suddenly going back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we have not gone out of the House at all," they said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire collapsed last week, thousands of local residents of the border communities, like Saad, left their homes or left their houses in order to move to safer areas further away from Gaza, and to escape the fire-fighting fires.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said that a dozen or so families had not returned.
Their children have been housed in other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city on Gaza, which is heavily drawn by the Palestinian attack.
He appealed to the children, to learn a lot and said "we will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on a permanent ceasefire last Tuesday.
The cease-fire ensured an immediate end to the fighting, but major problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and seaports in Gaza.
Israel demands disarming Hamas and handing over the corpses of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these figures and has estimated that at least half of the whales were fighters, but did not provide specific evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortars during the fighting in Israeli towns, most of them in the south.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 aircraft and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza region and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelter.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protection spaces and the fighting continues, education authorities are postponing the beginning of the school year.
"I hope the school will soon be open again so that we can continue to learn how the children in the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After choice in Saxony: CDU-Vice Strobl puts NPD-prohibited proceedings into question.
In view of the votes of the NPD in Saxony, Christian Federal German Federal Chancellor, Thomas Strobl, has spoken out in favour of an end to the current NPD prohibition proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to Christian Federal German Federal Government Thomas Strobl, the current prohibition proceedings against the NPD should be stopped before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD performs worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU-Landeschef in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung."
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is politically combated and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed to meet the 5% threshold during the vote on Sunday.
A first attempt to ban the extreme right party failed in 2003, because constitutional protection at the time, at the NPD, had informants.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join in.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the end of the day, refugees are now placed in tents.
The head office for refugees in Harburg burst out of all seams.
Now the office of the Interior Agency has made three of the Red Cross tents next door.
The provincial politicians were informed only briefly - they are hardly enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions further increase the public's reluctance and do not give regional leaders a chance to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says about Britta Herrmann, group chairman of the Greens in the Harburg County Assembly.
Your party claims that the district administration of Harburg currently has unused homes for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overcrowding in the first instance are the rush of help-seekers - and the fact that the authorities are unable to provide sufficient places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees are therefore longer than the regular three months.
The property prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in Australia's capital rose by 1.1% in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
Due to this increase the overall increase in June, July and August was 4.2 percent, the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price rise was 10.9%, more than twice the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but increases were not distributed evenly across the country.
The Research Leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, shared that Sydney and Melbourne drive a divided market.
The numbers of RP data show that the house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% over the past year, but at 11.7% in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by 5% and 6% on average.
Canberra, at the other end of the scale, was hit hard by cuts in government spending, and where prices rose only by 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lawless said that, for the next few months, with the arrival of the spring, there will be an increase in the sale of property that would be subject to a real test.
"When one considers the ongoing high rates of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion on the New Press, it contradicts statements by the CEO of Peer Medau and attests to the "like a Feldherr."
The style of the university, that is not to say, is in the communication.
In the middle of June, the Medau family had already been informed orally about the Andre of the University.
The statement that the plans were published first in July is definitely wrong, "says Pötzl.
At the same time, it refers to the fact that the plans are not 'preliminary or even decisions', but there are 'preferences'.
Even the construction of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for access to the castle, is less dramatic than the Meda fears.
It was a nine-metre-wide road and has not been mentioned.
The current situation is 5.50 metres, one metre wider than previously, "explains Pötzl.
The Medau operator's point of view is that your free and cost-efficient parking spaces in future will only be used by students of the university, and will not be allowed to apply.
It won't be parked at all, because it can now be resolved intelligently as in other public parking spaces.
Living with the residents of the region
The children's pants, which are situated on the ground and which would lead to the parking deck on their doorstep, should not be affected by the university president.
Instead, he has to consider that it is not only a case of children's crèches, but also about the inhabitants of the city in connection with the birth of the Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the nearby real school.
So Pötzl is about much more than one of the vested interests of Mr Medau.
Whether the critique of the parental leave of the children's skin, with the development of the street, would be "entitled" the few natural spots of Coban, "the reader can decide on itself."
At the beginning of October Pötzl together with the State Building Office Bamberg will want to inform the city authorities about the development of the university by 2020 "and, in this context, the importance of the new development."
Peer Medau informed the parents of the children's page about the plans of the university last week.
Therefore, the access to the new parking deck will not be on the campus and the Friedrich Streib road, but above the Medau-Berg.
This means that the narrow road should be double-track for about a mile length.
According to projections from the Medaus, the transport in the park of Hohenfels castle would be ten times higher.
About 2000 vehicles are mentioned on a daily basis.
From sites of the city you have not wanted to comment on the project.
Glandorf comes from Handball-national national team.
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31 year-old from the Federal Government of Flensburg-Handewitt gave particular health problems.
The decision is not easy, it has grown over several months.
It's me time to listen to the signals from my body and stop my career in the national team ', the World Champion in 2007 on his Facebook page.
It follows a balance sheet of 167 Country Games and 576 goals for Germany in its international retirement.
Due to the large backspace players for the Champions League champion in Flensburg for a few years on Torejagd, he will no longer be available to the new German press Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf brought about a "long and good conversation with the Islands, who visited the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me as well as those of my long-time competitors and my successors.
But for my club I want to be healthy in the next few years, and longer regeneration breaks are necessary.
The left side had to be afraid of his career ending in 2012.
Due to Achilles heel problems, he had been treated by a doctor from the German Handballbunder (DHB) with a cornipze, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other procedures followed.
Then, Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the confrontation ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven-year professional careers do not go unnoticed on a single body.
I have some health sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three symptoms of infection, which took place at short intervals in 2012, I have never managed to get a grip on my blood pressure.
For this purpose, there are some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that although I control my head, my body could not be fooled, "Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine" Handball Time. "
For a comeback it would be only available in absolute emergency.
"If all the blades tear, I am always ready to talk," said the two-fold family father the specialist magazine.
However, I can count on one hand for the years I can play.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have become rather humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, I want to move at least to some extent.
In addition to the World Championship title 2007 and the winner of the Champions League in 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In addition, Flensburg won the trophy of the European Cup in Flensburg with Flensburg.
Germany's economy shrank by 0.2% in the spring.
The crises around the world have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product fell from April to the end of June 2014, compared to the previous quarter by 0.2%.
The German Federal Statistical Office announced that it had provisional calculations.
Consumption animates the economy in the spring, while the investment went back.
Foreign trade also slow down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual programme, the first half-year of the year is a GDP-plus of 0.8% compared with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste," which was first introduced by Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzfer" on Sunday.
The biggest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste."
This is the biggest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
For more than 1000 participants, with their registration at Jos, they are responsible for organising this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered in several specialist magazines.
We come from Den Helder and have moved overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland again in this way, "the cyclists were happy about the route through part of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registering in the association of contactors Sta.
Catherine walked on a little "peace journey" through the city via the Wall, where the start was also made.
Further down the route, which was advertised for three different categories, in the direction of Herrenholz via the Schöppinger mountain towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 km with 1775 metres of altitude, cyclists show their good condition.
They were transported on the road to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer, Jos, and mayor of Heinz Lölfing, was very pleased with the success of this sport event.
We are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for all concerned.
The organisation went smoothly and there were no negative incidents, "Heinz Lölfing initiated a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not many participants, as the organizer had hoped, probably due to bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We are looking forward to seeing it again in 2015 on the 30th of August or during another weekend, but have promised to return the cyclists back to the Münsterland and the organisers are planning a new edition.
Man's wake-up call to ruthless memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony as a biography, what Constantine Wecker, Songmaker, pacifist, Political Effective, Political, Democrat, Political, Political, Political, Democrat, and Warriors, on 287 pages on 287 pages.
On June 1, 1947, his memoirs were written down on the basis of an appropriate song text.
And he is merciless: From Onanie as a high-school-high-school-up to charging bank and drug use, he has no human weakness.
Also, to show how he has learned tolerance in his dealings with his fellow human beings.
Broad spaces also take abstract, but even more important terms a: Love, soul, ego, the being in now, spirituality - all he tries to go on the ground, on a very philosophical but also very personal way.
He also explains his pacifist, his social criticism, his political commitment, and his political commitment, and also how he has not only played the music (the opera lovers will become the soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker also closer to the asketic monk, "by subtraction," as he says, "by making all the impossible."
But there are also short anecdotes between all the spiritual views on the earth, such as the thugs in one of GIs frequented in a pub or a crazy car trip, where he set a head on a tree.
Also there it is merciless honestly.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into the arm.
Has never said 'I love you'.
Henry was one of seven children of a family of jamaiian immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was, was working in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tested for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was born from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a blend of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood memories.
He attended "many" therapies following the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was difficult to know him.
One could not see his face, only heard his voice: "Listen to the collar.
Let your sister be quiet.
Go to it!
I want to see cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown when I was a child - went to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the beer glases or the beauty of a crib.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life was this serious type in the corner, which read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry had opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how his life for him could have been.
It is slightly brighter, but they are dark, rough, deep-style labyrinths with flame riots and smoke.
My father simply entered into the tub and then he was able to listen to him slowly, as he started to sing, because he could wash the foundries.
When I was there, it became clear to me that he had done so for years to get food on the table, and my respect for him was increased.
Nevertheless, Henry was born as a child without the love of his parents.
My father hugged me never, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was ill at the end of her life, "I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love that he had missed as a child.
Would you like to stop "I love you?
Stop me to hug me!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still French friends with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys's own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
When I was very, very overweight, and symptoms of diabetes showed, said my doctor "you must be radical.
So I took this fitness and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henrys's career change is perhaps reflected in its elegant, short cut-cut bart.
Ever since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he was captured by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of the Fences, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and comedies, which completed their working life.
He started with only 16 years when he was working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage, when he imitated and wrote to New Faces.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies.
He learned in his profession.
I had to learn not only from the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I was able to become an efficient wize narrative, while I was a star by television, and that was really difficult.
Back in 1975 on New Faces
For his manager the stage rules of the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment programme, in which the people had "black anmums," Henry recorded his comedy there over five years.
The staff was very friendly and helpful.
I wish somehow that it had never happened, but I do not regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on gigantic projects and learned how to handle a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
In the 1980 "s, Henry joined an alternate comedycircle in the 1980" s.
The first series of the lenny Henry Show appeared in 1984 on the show, and in the 1990s he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie boss!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film rolls were the next decade, but according to his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What are you going next, Len, because it all feels like you just have the time or a little bit on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was really allergic.
I had never learned something about him in school and thought it mostly for a domain of middle-class, whitewash and a mower in front of him.
So I had a great fear of it.
All that we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "you should try it.
Do not make it bad if you do not know what you are doing.
Take a few words and then you will understand why we love Shakespeare.
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt that I was able to do so.
It was almost as if someone were finally getting the head on.
"This is what it is, it's a serious matter, they take it seriously, bring your text, journalists a bit.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read them for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that simply did not happen.
Soon he appeared in the comedy's comedy.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, 'Oh, you changed you'.
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to entertain the public.
"A small voice said to me" you have to catch 10 minutes while you repair the computer. "
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, 'Oh, thank God'.
I am not responsible for it.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, that is, in your role."
Henry in Fences on Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was a demanding one.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the eyes.
Even that was a good thing, so it is like a large shield from the gods that say to me, "This is your rule."
He says this, of course, with a forgiving voice.
So I stand by.
I really love it.
I love to be in a test room.
However, Henry still has the head of a comedian - a conversation with humorous eruptions, while he constantly imitates people.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy, because I think that this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
When you look around it, you take a wall.
I am sometimes playing in the Apollo if I feel like it, but in general I don't have that much as before.
I wonder if he ever will make a stand-up comic tour.
The fun that I have in an area with a director who helps to make a start, a middle part and the end of a trip - I do not think I want to give up.
So is this a new incarnation?
I think it is.
I love to play an actor.
It is fun and fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels are blocking roads in Yemen's capital city.
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni Government, the Huthis has been calling for civil disobedience in the capital, Sanaa.
Huthi followers, on Monday, held central roads in Sanaa, said a spokesman for the Huthi party "Ansar Allah."
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni's media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online version of the newspaper "Yemen Post," Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on the action on Sunday evening.
Huthi was threatened with further escalation of the conflict, but its demands should not be fulfilled.
The Shiite Huthis fights for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen, and demand the government's resignation.
For almost two weeks, the Yemeni capital, the Yemeni capital, has been besieging the Yemeni capital.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the great access routes of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya's registered officials to contain "ghost worker."
Kenya has begun to register all government officials to delete "ghost workers" from the government's pay lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay, was a government communication.
The government has suspected that thousands of people will still receive salary payments after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service in 2013.
At the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700,000 £) per month was lost in payments for "ghost workers" and by other abusive financial practices.
The government expects that salaries will continue to be paid out on accounts after one person died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must appear in the next two weeks of identification centres to ensure that their data will be recorded on biometric registrations has been communicated in a government message.
Anyone who did not delete this without a credible apology would be deleted from the salary list.
"This procedure has made a significant contribution to rationalising public service by establishing the actual number of officials and eliminating the pay list at both levels of government - the" ghost workers "are being eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of decentralisation and planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultants Helge Achenbach will be taking place on 11 November for the first time.
Five heirs to Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi-Gründers.
That was a case of a court speaker on Monday.
In the basket clause, Achenbach was charged with the purchase of works of art and oldtimers and Berthold Albrecht higher than actual paid purchase prices.
This would also mean the agreed commission was higher.
Achenbach purchased valuable assets for Albrecht for 121 million Euros.
Children need the roots and wings
44 years he was at school, of whom 23 was head of school.
From that time, Manfred Richter has many distinguished Petershoutmen and Kollbacher from their time as pupils.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always guided by his desire to see people in the student.
The snow level is the most famous mountain of the Krkonoše mountains.
Manfred Richter likes the painting with the motif from his native country.
Judge was born at Trautenau / North Bohemia in 1930, today Trutnov.
After four years of secondary school he was interested in the teacher's profession.
One year after that, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their homes.
After several months in one camp in 1946, it went to Bavaria - in the freight trolley.
So it turned judges into the upper-end village of Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
In order to do so, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometres to the next station six times a week, with the train to Bamberg, three kilometres across the entire city and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter won a sleeping place in a Red Cross Home in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 co-ers in a sleeping room.
In 1951 he founded the first State Academy after three years of teaching staff.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free apprenticeship for him, he went to Oberbayern and came to school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Harvest Room" was its first "apartment" in the school building.
In 1958 he referred to a three-room apartment next to the school.
This House bought Manfred Richter 1980 after the school was dissolved in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in Petershausen school, and in Petershausen five.
From the school year of 1968 / 69, they were consolidated in Petershausen in today's city hall.
When the School Association Indersdorf was founded, there was only the primary school in town.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the lower school, the then Rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlovy Vary and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain today's construction from September 1982.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at the municipal cost, has also built a workshop room and the extension of 1997 cellar rooms, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very supportive," he remembered.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a leader who replied to a Board of Ministers on justice and justice: "One must never forget to forget the love." Manfred Richter had to do what he had heard as a young teacher.
"One must give children two things: The roots and the wings," says today's 84-year-old.
And he had to know: "He didn't always succeed." He was not quite clear about his pupils or his own six children.
In any case, Judge was sometimes unconventionally.
If there were any students, they did not receive some kind of criminal work and nor were they left to sit back.
At the expense of the congregation judges had to create two pair of boxing gloves and let the two opposing parties compete against each other, even if there was to be a gap.
For the benefit of school, judges held a good relationship with the then mayor, Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the non-partisan judges to run in 1996 at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipal council.
But judges were elected to six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
Hr4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists drive on the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scots stopovers.
When cyclist on her tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast, there is nothing special about it.
On Friday, however, it was the number of resting times: The 700 participants in the hr4 cycle tour, accompanied by accompanying ones, enjoyed a pause in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the gravel park.
The participants took part on Thursday in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and celebrated a concert of Van Baker and Band there.
On Friday, it was taken seriously: The cyclist took the first stage, the 60 kilometres above Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and continued to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Novella, who was co-initiated in Bad Vilbel by bike, were welcomed by the director of the self-operation Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the sake of refreshment of body and spirit, many good things have been prepared: The rural women from Ranststadt and Nieder-Mockstadt have had 85 sheets of apple, pitching, mud, and cheese cakes that perfectly let you know.
"Such cakes can only bake women's wives," they praised Aulendiebach, and during which he saved another piece of work.
Cold refreshments could be obtained from the drinks allowance of Geiß-Nida.
The "duo Bravo" kept the visitors with famous tunes from operetta and musicals, and enthusiastic applause.
The hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful.
A Lord also enjoyed a head massage of his partner: "He deserved, after all, he put his hands on the wheel."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: They were interviewed on the fountain in front of the tip-house of reporters Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Even promotional director Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 cycle tour in 2004 as a tour leader, could barely snow, had to do a lot with technology on the ground.
His pick-up truck, where he communicated with three phones and a radio unit with his staff and the 15-person motorcycle squadron of the police in Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants from the Rhine-Main region," they said, "said," also made from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from many cities in Westphalia, cyclists have travelled.
The number of participants depends on the accommodation capacity.
In category I the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective documents.
The resort had a good impression when it came back to one and a half hours after: "Chüss!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" They turned them out to leave.
After arriving in Scots, the group was allowed to pause for a short break.
But in the evening the cyclist was called for in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had a beautiful festive atmosphere and, of course, had been prepared with goodies, such as flame-cream cakes with well-cooled spring white.
Mayor of Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC-chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as director of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcome visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen gave the dance stage free.
In spite of the sporting activity on the bicycle, the opportunity for the smooth running of the open air has been eagerly exploited.
Among the guests there was an increasing number of citizens, who were equally impressed by the good mood and the great numbers of cyclists.
On the second day for the cyclists, the stations Birstein, Guardiansbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the separators - were on the agenda.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycle, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested on "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on grounds of suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," reporting local media agencies.
The police authorities did not give any direct comment.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level police officers, who report obstacles rily Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly founded an organised criminal association and had tapped telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was the Prime Minister at that time) described her approach as part of the activities being led by the Islamist clergy of his stealth against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all the children in Ukraine are returning to school.
Schools almost all over Ukraine opened on Monday (1st September) on Monday (1st September).
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he informed journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian grassroots front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukwie, director of school school in Slawjansk, who visited Jazenjuks's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace and that the children will receive a form of education that will be useful in future life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, ballons in their hands and flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC might have found the great director it needs.
It meets with a proud history of the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
It has its own front-hand experience.
Their careers began with Bain and Co. in the global management consultancy company Bain and Co., on which they changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of Pearsons.
She was CEO of the Financial Times seven years ago and resigned as the top post of the parent company Pearsons to a younger male colleague.
It was estimated that it was almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: She became the cabinet minister.
Her husband is an old Tory Council member.
Back in May, I described the task of the Chairman with a poisoned kelch.
It is not only the BBC that is a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but also an internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence in two directions: The first guard of its own Manageian hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and anxiety, when things go wrong.
This provides for an almost unsustainable duopoly required for full-scale reform.
But what incoming chairman would risk being able to go on everything, and multiply an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps bringing himself to his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many would like to see the BBC reduced - power, money, and status.
While the competition is approaching and new technologies are threatening to threaten convenience, the upcoming negotiation of royalties to the BBC poses specific dangers.
For the modest sum of EUR 145.50 £per year, the British public is certainly acquiring the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: It says that it accounts for 96% of households, and only 40 pence per day.
And, apparently, the BBC is rising again up to 53%, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I am now receiving news on my mobile phone and I understand later on working programs on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very dear and significant institution.
She needs a distinguished chairman - I hope she has found it.
Ford from Texas says that drunken tweet was not authorised
A tweet of the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday included a belated remark about the democratic district prosecutor, who was at the centre of a criminal offence against him because of abuse of authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of the Perrys user account that expired the previous account.
Just a tweet has been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I cheap the Tweet and have deleted it," said it in the later message.
Staff from Perry did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although the tweets were issued by Perrys's official user account, it was not clear who actually used the feed.
In the former tweet, a negative image of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned in April 2013 because of drunkenness.
Reagan put a veto against financial support for its offices when she refused to resign, which led to a charge against Perry - who might be the presidential candidate in 2016 - before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The Tweets's text reads: "I am not always drunk with the three-fold permitted levels of alcohol... but when I do it, I reject Governor Perry if he likes it '.
I am the most powerful democrat in Texas.
The office was not responsible for the examination of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Reagan was not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-class team of legal counsel requested that the law be dismissed and argued that the law, which deals with the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas, is inconspicuous.
Musharraf stopped 7.5 million dollars of government money into the state's Public Integrity Unit - located in Travis County, and in cases of government corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perrys's official account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
When he completed five-fifths during his presidential election sessions in Iowa in 2012, the Perry went on speculation that he would stop using a tweet of a photo of the joys near a lake near a lake, with the words' South Carolina, we come! '
Berkeley explains housing market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market was returned to normal levels in the south-east of England.
Homes in the capital were hotly sought and the subject of huge price increases, owing to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, owing to the widespread fear of lending to mortgage lending in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013, and added that this provides a" stable environment. "
The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Land Registry, prices in urban areas rose by 18.5% over the last year alone, far more than the average growth in England and Wales overall.
The average sales prices of polio's private, low-cost and student offers increased by about one-fifth last year and at the end of April to the 423,000 £.
But a larger pound has, in recent months, made property ownership in London less attractive for foreign buyers - some of them have been deterred by the introduction of new housing taxes and political rhetoric around a possible "villa tax" before the general elections next May.
Last week, London's real-estate agents, Foxton, warned that, in the second half of the year, market growth would lead to lower market growth both for property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday showed a decline in mortgage lending in July, which also suggests that the housing market is cooling.
Hamptions International, a other real estate agency, corrected its predictions for the rise in real-estate prices in London for 2015 downwards to 3%, based on an already depressed body of food.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen by a quarter of a quarter, according to the broker WA Ellis.
However, the desire to have a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts are due to more than €2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations has remained stable and has remained stable as a result."
In June, the company reported that there were 3,742 new homes in the year before the end of April - almost one-third more than the peak of 2007 prior to the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40% annually by €280 million, sales by 18 percent to €1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday prior to the annual general meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley in the current year are expected to meet the current market expectations.
The analysts consistently valued the annual pre-tax earnings of €450 million.
Berkeley shares held in London trade in the afternoon at 23.96 £.
Naked pics of Jennifer Lawrence by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance on the 85th Oscarhire.
Naked pics of the Oscarprize winner Jennifer Lawrence were released online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of more than 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos from Lawrence are real and complained to the hackers for "flagrant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who re-post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were allegedly sold by a hole in the online storage system icloud from Apple, the alleged "master list" of the hacker victims included the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported Buzzfeed.
It is not sure how many of the images are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who have seen photos taken by my husband and I recently in the private environment of this House - I hope you are as good as you are with you," Written wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the nativity series "iCarly" and "but" but "did" out that the photos were pictures of her and tweetete "These so-called nude pictures of me are falsified, people.
Let's take a closer look at the beginning.
Buzzfeed reported at the late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop star Ariana Grande stunned the authenticity of the supposed photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J."
They were milled, so they could be best described, they slowly came up to like a cartonboard that they had in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman said that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distancing himself and perhaps a bit of scratch.
And then he shook his hand.
They did not know how to use it.
It was disgusting, as in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this muddle was a just beginning, which was more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life, and perhaps even had a certain degree of satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a hypnotic beauty with uncoated hair and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, even more remote and rough, as port Reuben.
It was accompanied by an older accompaniment to the south, the Kevern believed for her aunt, and which had inherited a property in a damp but paradise valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leck, in the baths were still spiders, neck shears had their traces left on all windows and believed that they belong to them all, and the garden was watched with weeds that saw huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a children's tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker price in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had a hand with an Ailinn and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon on the broken deck chairs, both of which had an unusually warm spring afternoon, which caused the land with soothing music and appetizing news, when the sight of its crossed brown legs reminded him of an old track of a long-forgotten black entertainer, which his father had a long forgotten record on closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too large.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer on the console.
It was simply not forbidden - nothing was prohibited from being banned.
It has been successfully rendered obsolete, as the word obsolete.
The general taste was, what leaving and rules had never done, and how the people of books choose the From thecthought-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love romane, so they chose the ballads on the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern started playing an imaginary piano and had great feet in a coarse-comical Serenade.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"This was a famous song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done so to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers above your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was not a very funny game at that time, and it was not very funny.
He knew that he knew that that was everything.
It had to explain what was jazz.
Ailinn had never heard of it.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly banned.
It wasn't even more modern to improvise.
It was just place for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be safe at the beginning of a melody, where they would end.
So is the mind.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically beaten mind.
Though he was ten years old, without having heard Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the half-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he had to not explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
In her age she could probably not remember a time in which pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints were needed.
A compliant company meant that each element of this company would be grateful for the principle of group skill.
People with Afro-Caribbean origins were suitable for entertainment and sport due to temperament and gardening and burned them.
People who were originally from the Indian sub-continent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and cared for, to ensure that no family had no functioning staff.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the seduction; what the Greeks had to say was crushed.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, as a WHEN WAR, IF WAR, IF WHEN WAR - a fear of being accused of fire brigades - fearing even that the flames would eat next - had to be seen and were depressed by inaction.
Each one of his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the abusive words that Kishn had just sung could ever make easier.
Music was an expression of love.
"They are not really offensive," said Kevern.
And perhaps for people whose feet are too large.
My father has never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the large amounts of coal.
Ailinn still does not understand it.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on it in her present day.
She thought that he was a little strange.
"It seemed fun to him," he said.
They shook their heads and blocked Keaves's view.
There was nothing more to see in the whole world than her unscathed rabid hair.
There was nothing else that he would have wanted to see.
"If you say it," I mean it without conviction.
But that does not explain why you are thinking of it.
It seemed to be honest about it.
Are my feet too big?
Once again, he looked at it.
Your feet so directly not.
Perhaps your ankle, a small bit...
And you say, you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate?
Of course I hate you not.
That is just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you treat me," he tried instead.
I am a bit perturbed.
That did not sound right.
It had to be comical.
When he tried to be comical, he was often in trouble, because he did not have the reassuring Charm that he had, as his father had, to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he, Kevern, that he would be.
Despite its friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from her deckchair, threw the console around and sent out the wine she had drunk.
Wine-growing wine, so drunkenness was not an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your colder head is exactly the reason why I feel you go to you," she said...
Except that I am not alone.
They were sorry, both because of the unnecessary uneasiness of his words and the fear that turned out to be in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did she think that he would beat them?
She had not told him about her life on the cold northern archipelago, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and icy ocean struck as it was on the banks of the river.
The same confusing men, with even thicker skin and slender after the WHOLE WAR had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, pulled out of pub bar, always ready to raise a woman's hand against a woman who refused or lost her.
The head of the head?
They would have shown a thick fist if it didn't fit.
It was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the crescent balloons from the console - the most common word for an erotic attraction between men and women, and then beat them.
According to Kebern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the Knutschen himself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through her body.
He arose out of the deckchair like an old man.
She also took a lead, but the strength of his sorrow surprised him.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew.
They saw him as distant - like a room on the upper floor of her companion - a man who complained about something he begged himself.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, despite some of her hands against them.
One man turned away from her from her back, ashamed, defeated, without a martial spirit - why was this a sight that she seemed to know well, if she didn't remember a single time he had ever seen before today's day?
When she was back alone, Ailinn found solomons on her feet.
Several years before the events that were just mentioned, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public sentiment, was working on a short presentation on the continued violence at low and medium levels in exactly the parts of the country where the reduction, if not abolition, was most likely to be expected to be expected, given the money and energy that had been invested in eradicating this violence.
"Much has been done and much remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the congenital aggressiveness of a people who fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the isolated corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness has historically always been felt, despite the high-quality cherries between the hedges.
But some characteristics prove to be indestructible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less passion he still has.
When listening to sentimental balloons, the population thrives on stories of profound difficulties and claims to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but still does not only maintain the old raw materials of the rural communities, as well as our urban fabric, but also provides evidence of the emergence of a new and miserly object in the home, at work, on the streets and even on the game fields.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," she thought when he read the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
ESME Nussbaum melts her head.
I also have to ask: Are you atheist?
"I do not think I have to say that," ESME Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Again, ESME has its right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I do not ask this," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, reading or feminism.
This is a non-profit-free workplace here.
We serve as a non-profit-free company.
However, certain types of hypersensitivity, which are totally acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort the results you have presented.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you refer to as' feigning 'and' roh ', could be interpreted equally well by others as well as expression of a sense of strength and vitality.
If you continue to walk on it, WHEN IS WHY IS, IF IS IS WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT THE WHAT IS WHAT THE WHAT WHAT THE WHAT WHAT THE WHAT WHAT THE WHAT WHAT THE WHAT WHAT THE WHAT WHAT THE WHOLE IS, as if it had happened yesterday, it means that if it had happened yesterday, it would mean that it was essential for the country to come to terms with its essential life force.
ESME Nussbaum was looking at when Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head repeated an LED statue in Flamingorosa the advice that Ofnow had granted to the country in the last quarter of a century or longer.
Smile your neighbor, value your partner, hear ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, say you, listen, listen to, please excuse yourself.
Speaking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely absolutely what you want," says ESME Nussbaum with a quiet voice when she was sure that she had spoken before, "and I say nothing more than that we have not yet been treated as effectively as we ourselves are deluding ourselves.
My concern is that without warning us, we may find ourselves at the same time as the mistakes that were made at the time TO THE WHOLE IS WHAT THE WHOLE IS, IF IS IS IT.
This time, however, it is not the other people who let us lose our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands of Rabinowitz.
In order to indicate an eye patient d.
"You go too far," he said, "If you refer to acts as" mistakes, "which our grandparents might or did not commit.
They also go too far when you say that these "rage" and "distrust" have left "others."
It should not, in fact, be necessary to remind anyone in your position that when it comes to understanding past and protecting the present, we do not talk about 'us' and 'others'.
There was no "we" and there was no "other."
It was a time of disorder; that is all we know.
"From if we are honest about ourselves," said ESME "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I do not blame anyone.
Whether or not it was bad or well done, it has been done.
That was then.
There has to be no more say - we agree on that.
And, just like no fault has to be assigned, it should not be blamed if such a charge would be appropriate and if there were any ways of tilting it.
But for what purpose is the past, if we do not learn from it -
The past is for us to forget.
If I may say something about this, I would like to say something about this.
Napoleon Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed them.
The next day when she went to work as usual, she was overridden by a motorcyclist who, like passers-by, walked on the foot in a kind of "brutal rage."
There are cases.
Lesotho-military member says that no coup is planned; prime minister remains in South Africa.
Official officials of the military in Lesotho were determined to have planned a coup d'état and said that they were against policemen who were accused of arming the political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and informed that the army of the country occupied his office and occupied government buildings in the capital.
The Prime Minister brought his family to South Africa after he had reported attacks on attacks.
Military spokesmen Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup d'état, but that the military responded to the threat of "political fanatic" whose armament was elevated by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces were running out of Lesotho after having received several secret services, that he had several intelligence reports that there were some elements within the police that some of those who wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were on the verge of devastating damage," he said, said to Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman, Clayson Monyela, said that military action had the impression of a revolution.
"Even if no one has claimed that the government has been torn down by force, all the reports have agreed that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho are currently showing signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Supporters of the military in Lesotho said, on Sunday, that soldiers were returning to their barracks and the situation in the capital city was quiet.
In the meantime, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mothetjoya Metsing, takes over governance during Thabanes's absence.
Thabane said that he believed he was a target for his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been large-scale tensions since June, after Thabane parliamentary meetings set out in its unity government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, despite the opposing accusations.
Production in the euro area on a 13-month level
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point of the last 13 months in August, according to a study carried out.
The final Markit purchasing management index of the production company (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after 51.8 in July.
One indication of 50 gives an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced breakdowns at a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with the eurozone's sluggish recovery, and for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the ECB's head, Mario Draghi, could give further indications later this week whether it will consider quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those in the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers have become more obvious," says Rob Dobson, leading economist in Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second-largest economic country of block, France, the PMI was 46.6.
France remains a sorgenchild, as is the decline of Italy from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence suggests that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism of Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, are no longer effective, "said Mr. Dobson.
The fall in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect more monetary or fiscal stimulus.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3 million, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Captain Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing that can be said about the purchasing manager's index of the manufacturing trade in the eurozone from August is that the sector will continue to grow."
He added that "in the eurozone," producers in the eurozone appear to be very difficult at present, given that the current rise in geopolitical tensions, particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine, increase uncertainty in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased uncertainty has made it quite clear to the economy - particularly, and consumer confidence - and is likely to cause some missions to be delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said that "ever more likely" will be that the ECB will eventually have to launch a kind of QE, "although we suspect that it will be limited."
The life expectancy of Beslan survives: Ten years have passed since the great siege of the school, as the children suffering from it are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people from Chechen militias were taken hostage in a school in Beslan in Southern France.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had forgotten death in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, where 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, they appeared to be the most maligned of evil.
The tragedy shaped the West and East in disgust, and then turned out surprisingly in action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had forgotten death in the classroom.
We have seen surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will keep them forever.
Its biggest hope?
The war that Ukraine is now looking for - and in the children as it die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed in trying to climb into the sled school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Feakov, when she only tried to climb into the sled school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida sought Aida after her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were deemed dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me that I am going to run my life but I could not do," Aida said then.
My legs were exhaled.
I stood up and climbed back in order to search for my mother.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a number of operations she felt completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I am afraid that I need to be dealt with again.
Some grenades are still in my knees.
Their aim is to be a dentist, to help the people who have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not break me," she says.
"It happened to me, and that cannot be changed.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I will try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together, when we were small, and dreamed of going to school.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later on.
It says that the siege will always remain a part of it, even though the memory of each year is somewhat weak.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and are so grateful for the help we have received from the United Kingdom and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, how I return to school, I think that many people will see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to the fact that something like this does not happen again.
The boy, who fled through the battlefield, believed that his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (Russians went to school for 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year old, he said: 'Mum has told me that I am supposed to be responsible if there is an explosion and that they hold their hands.'
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said unto him: "Run."
Full of fear, it could be dead, he fled and saw the way a crying infant, he stood at hand and fled through a ball-collar.
His father, Vladimir, who closed his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I could not save them."
In reality, Tamara was unearthed out outside and there were injuries in the hospital, partly in the assumption that her son had fallen.
After her reunification, she said: 'I am crying for joy.
I was unable to believe.
He ran out and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now unsolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and his wife Chery.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will be pale in my memory.
I still know that immediately I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play games with shooting scenes and that is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, whom I played in the court and who did not leave it outside.
We never say that they were killed or dead.
We say that they have remained in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London, especially on the toys shop, where I was able to choose everything I wanted and driving in an up-and-out car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends have suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me of it.
"I am so sorry for all those who are suffering the horrors," said Damir, who was working as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I am happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope that it will take me next year at the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, you can imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could be called up and running, and that silence lasted many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London were crying when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her Foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cheria and say that ten years have passed, but I am still listening to her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and myself have helped me.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschisch and called it all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant.
And that was just one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were willing to share our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die and I believe that many children have been killed and killed.
These are exactly the same children as ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news that they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I simply know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I cannot stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, the people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir was large and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the last Greuches.
I know that he does not like to be reminded of this, but he has six close friends out of the class and they occasionally go into the sports hall and igniting candles.
When he was small, he was suffering - I remember, as he sometimes turned on the sofa, the face of us turned on for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember how he continued his weapons and other military toys.
I cannot believe that I have been so sure for a couple of hours that he is dead and I never see him again.
When I recovered and put on my feet after the explosion, I saw myself and saw the hell around me around the body parts around me.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy was unable to survive in this hell.
"I remember that I went to him," Damir, run, run away, "but I was also so sure he didn't hear me.
But he has heard and he has gone away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy, his terrible image after the siege became the symbol of Beslan's abominations.
Comfort: The Beslan survivors Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His bloodstream face was drawn by fear when he burned his life, while Chechen terrorists shot their classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had removed him for his first school day before leaving her older son, Vladimir.
"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my small boy remained there for three terrible days," he remembers.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgiy managed to survive.
The closer this date draws, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not one day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
I do not think it is a long time, I think it would happen yesterday, some scenes from those days seem to me forever.
No one will forget that, I promise you.
Urgent: The picture of Georgij (on the left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school and said that he wanted to go to his teacher.
I knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture and it is hidden from our house in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also believe that the people of all over the world are feeling our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij today says, "It is important that such a thing never happens again.
"I doubt that we have ever experienced the truth.
People are investigating such tragedies and they never know the truth.
And now they are investigating the collapse of these Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world will be a little horrifying.
"I cannot understand how this can be done, for if you ask people, no one wants a war, so what happens?
Ten years has nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget a little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it is.
For three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
Later in 2004 I went back to school and were afraid.
I thought to my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when 1 September approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It is difficult for me to go into the sports hall, but I do have to do it.
I do not feel as a victim, this story is a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not paint me.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and attend a medical university in Vladikawkaz.
I will be a heart surgeon.
My first election was an education in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not permit that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgiy Faniev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
A miracle: Georgij Faniev was trapped during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was caught in the sports hall and sat beside the bomb, which was fixed at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It really is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel it was like whether it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to be a secret agent to become the FSB, but has not been able to do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, it is not something I have left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily evade experience - I have to say that this is wrong.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt better, but I cannot forget it.
And I would like to forget that.
2005 - in the year after that - was the first and only time that I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back and do not hesitate to ask you to show you where I was eating in this famous picture.
Survivors: Georgij Faniev today, with a photograph in hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is immense and I am wearing it every day.
My friends know that I am not happy about it or talk about it and they never asked me about the school.
I think it is a bad thing.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can do well now.
However, because of my health, I could not study the FSB's secret service academy in St Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have sent my documents, including the medical procedure, and replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I knew that I would never share my experience with my children.
Children should not know about this and they should not suffer.
His mother Marina, 42 said, "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse, when the anniversary draws nearer.
I shall be commemorating the celebrations.
I know that Georgij will not be going.
It has to be much more violent for him because he was there and I did not.
I waited at home on him and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back, here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but that horror is still in it.
It is difficult to accept that, when there is something so imfair.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he cannot attend because of his knee.
It has been operating on a number of occasions, but it can run, but there is no sport.
I would like to say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but one cannot completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, and this reinforces only my pain.
I lost many people who I knew well and were expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could do to me, but my heart is crying over the whales.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who have never married.
It is difficult to accept that life will continue, even if you do not want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in hospital.
And now I see what happens in the world - wars in other regions.
What are they fighting for?
Why kill them?
The war is now very close to our country and I cannot believe it.
We were a friendly country earlier, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many have been killed.
If only all of these rebels are able to catch up and throw out, we can go as far as possible.
Aljona Titzwa, 10
The baby, who was driven into safety by a special command station, was put into practice.
Save: Aljona Tammwa is brought into security by a Russian Special Command Command (on the left).
It is now ten (on the right) and does not recall the atrocities at all.
The world held its breath in 2004, when the baby Aljona was borne in the arms of a Russian police from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists allowed them to go, but in their cruelty they kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and his brother Makhar in the school sport stadium.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has been married since then and, with his new wife Swetlana, has published a small girl that he called Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come with the 10th anniversary.
You will understand why.
Defaulting girls on footballing in Fife has been accused of accusing girls of doing so.
A 78-year-old man stands on a footpath over a three-year-old girl on a footpath in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charge has been made, Mr Steward has steered his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injury to the girl.

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos with water, you can choose from a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a water-density point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam, such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which have to be around $300.
I have recorded these photos in a family lock with several cameras, all of them at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are closed.
Make your camera also on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders are equipped with the setting and recording mode optimized to optimize exposure times for low-lying underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the ground, test the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras are allowed only for up to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.

Make multiple recordings - because many do not fold.
Point-and-Shoot cameras are equipped with an LCD to compose images that action-cams typically don't.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water and the correct view of the picture is a good thing.
So make many recordings.
If your camera has a serial mode with which a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings are done, use it.
Remain close to the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
So, if possible, you will be close to the surface if you make recordings in a swimming pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
It is also a good Council, but it is even more important because of its poor lighting conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed-length nose, which means that you need to be more tightly connected to your objects if they are to fill the entire picture wire.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things even in such a gigantic organization like the NHS.
As a consultant for anaesthesia he devoted his own role in saving the sick from the agony of the disease as well as the treatment of the treatment.
Among his patients, it remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and illnesses, while the treatment was mostly done with something completely different: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the person who started his act.
"I did not feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulties trying to catch me.
While he had struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noted that he was impatient for his wife Juliet.
"I want to go to it as soon as possible," he did.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson was so unaccustomed and worried about it.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he had been to skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray investigation were presented.
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that incites the breast skin, in other words the lungs.
As with most cancer, the exact trigger is often difficult to determine.
For example, some smokers have contracted lung cancer, not all lung cancers have been smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos of asbestos - contact with the fibre material, which was once known as a "wonder commodity."
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that cannot be ignored.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos was no longer used in Britain since the 1960 "s, when industry voluntarily pledged not to use it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the substance - plumbers, construction workers, carpentry and shipyard workers.
As an industrial hazardous material from another era, it seems to be hardly even worrying today.
However, this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is today the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die in this disease than in the case of road accidents.
Annual figures in the case of mesotheliomtosis since 1980, and estimated future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are now experiencing the deadly effects, even though asbestos has been illegal for years, is that a mesotheliom is only developed after decades.
And the Scourter of Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers in the construction sector.
Asbestos was, and still is, in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protected area.
The Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy, they have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor was he a plumber.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have been in contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks as though in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I graduated for six years, a lot of asbestos was present," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and locals - will use the tunnel.
One wonders how many of my young people will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he could at least partially answer that question.
"The four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been suffering from Mesotheliom in the last five years," wrote in 2010 in a letter, "" I am the last person who lives. "
How many of us will become ill?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February, he was 53.
That was an unusually long time of survival.
Fifty per cent of all mesothelioma sufferers die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore repeat only Lawsons's question: 'How many of us will still develop?'
The UK's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that, between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is likely to come to nothing, there will be a total of 90.000 deaths.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die.

A quick look at the files of the courts in which those concerned frequently turn to claims for damage shows how far the Scourter's scourge is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks and Spencer, for example, gave them negligent exposure to asbestos in a negligent manner.
She spent nine years in the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothes department at two locations - one of the flagship stores in Oxford Street.
Ms. Allen was only 18 years ago when she started her activity at M & S.
Now it has two children in the twenties.
"Before this matter," she says, "she says," I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I did not even know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that I would be concerned about that.
There are few people who know a great deal about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "Asascform," a description of the fibre structure, which makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction sector.
Chrysotil, known as a white asbestos, is today by far the most common found asbestos in buildings.
It has been used for roofing panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, drilling insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is nonetheless seen by the EU and the WHO as a "major health risk" of possible death.
Dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there were clear but indirect indications that this was one of the main reasons for its unique high-quality ratio."

Janice Allen has perhaps not seen the typical measuring victims, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her history is certainly not unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected by the fact that "an important part of the mesothelioma without known suspension through work or in this House was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like nobody can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people were also at the heart of the government, unwittingly exposed to the substance.
2009 Goddard reported that the service stations and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos from the premises of Parliament with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be covered by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but this seems to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service has insisted that the West Minth Palace received a "clean health certificate," it is now undisputed that 1 billion £working will have to be raised over several years to renovate Parliament, to modernise the electrical installations and to remove the asbestos, and that, following the general election of 2015, Members will probably be meeting at the nearby QE2 conference centre than in the green banks of Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that 'the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions'.
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost.
All that can be done is to wait.
A person who was never able to determine contact with asbestos was Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have been working in a hospital where asbestos cases have been approved positively," he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all places where you worked and the data.
What he remembers exactly is the day at the beginning of December 2009, where he received such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and conducted an operation just late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills of water.
It suddenly happened.
I felt terrible.
I thought it was no longer possible to go home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the breast skin, the skin around his lungs, melted.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He was not working for one month.
In order to test liquid out of the lungs and test it in the laboratory, the doctors gave X-ray shots of his breast.
His complaints, however, remained without diagnosis.
His health was slowly improving, and he returned to his job.
However, from time to time, the symptoms came back, often after physical activity and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient had been diagnosed with similar symptoms in practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even now, Abbott does not do this with his / her own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had been working directly on asbestos.
The link in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's state deteriorated and his caregiver brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings into a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the ribs and the breast skin.
I am an optimist.
I usually do more than that, "he says.
To be honest, I had not had so many concerns about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was concerned.
The result of biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "You told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, who advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings in which pipes were often isolated from asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now falling ill.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical occupations.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos soliings in hospitals were below ground, so patients were probably not subjected to the substance.
But many staff who, in pedestrian jams from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or underground canteen (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving, but life-threatening doctors.
It will still be removed today.
Students presented their Bunsenburner on asbestos mats.
And it is not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, stores, libraries, and city halls due to its fabulous insulation and flame retardant properties.
Schools are also there.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemicals, students have parked their bunsel burner on asbestos mats.
On websites, the issue of asbestos is often addressed in schools.
At the same time, there are so innocent objects contained in our houses, such as floor plates or slipways, that contain asbestos by default.
"It is an industrial company that contains large parts of our property," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who, Andrew Lawson, has represented in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that affected an affected woman was the demolition of a horticulture in the 1970 "s.
So go on, how to cut off your garden scaling.
The effects of diagnosis, and knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noticed that I could not concentrate on what I did.
I was in practice two weeks ago.
Then I knew that I had to take care of myself.
Well, I am not going to see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective changed from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him he remembers how overwhelmed he was from all the information he had to cope with.
"It was very difficult to record everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor" how long did I still? "
And there were about 12 months later.
I remember that I thought "Well, I will not see another Christmas.
That's'. '
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious, because it is our life-recognition mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes cancer to cause cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of thin fibres.
When the asbestos is exposed and the fibres are inhaled, they can set themselves in the breast skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled nadelshaped asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax physician, who changed to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital, suspected by Andrew Lawson that it exposed it to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasury knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed to the edge by the breathing process, where the skin is.
From the very beginning it was invasiv.
The usual options for other cancers do not work properly with Mesotheliom.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, hotter disputed.
Some think it worth trying.
Treasure denies that.
"You cannot cut the breast skin," he says.
They do not come with the knife.
At the same time, cancer "does not speak very well" on chemotherapy, "which" has an effect, "but doesn't heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
At the end of the day, however, they are dying.
Fortunately, some patients have lived for a long time, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After he contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man-support and advisory office for co-workers.
"Hello, Cancer central," he was cheerful in calling.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis for four years and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last longer than one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to make things happen in a rather more positive light. "
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, Heart-Thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage that I did not need to be moved, I just got an appointment," says Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a bank transfer and have to wait for permission.
Money is crucial for Mesotheliom sufferers to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But when these treatments fail inevitably, many people are affected by another financial worry - about the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960 "s was that one realized that even a very low level of exposure was a health risk.
And here, the negligence of companies has begun to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually made a case, but it was not what Morgan calls "full compensation," as Lawson was not able to prove with absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom was the result of an Assurcontact with Guy's.
After the investigation to his death, a spokesman for Guy, however, confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is for Mesotheliom sufferers who seek compensation, an enormous problem, the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documentation may be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there has been clear new legislation this year, making it easier for Mesothelix patients to receive compensation even if their former employers cannot be found any more.
The law has established a $350 million fund funded by the insurance industry, which was diagnosed after July 2012, to be able to demonstrate, but no one has been able to sue.
In these cases, the plaintiff received 80% of what a court could have referred to in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 pounds.
Approximately 300 successful applications are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many mesothelic sufferers, that 350 million £is a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal for insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have had to pay if the time did not go over, and Mesotheliom sufferers could find them and set them up for normal.
Also Mike Penning, ladies and gentlemen, has admitted that the law "is not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that a rapid response was needed in the face of seven deaths every day.
"People suffer so much and need assistance today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act last December.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski since 19 months.
After her first deliberation, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he had a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and a chemotherapy - a three-degree therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40% over five years.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This is, of course, the most important thing," says Abbott.
That can be seen again and again with patients.
There is something on which you can move on.
If you enter, you will be worse off.
Graham Abbott withdrew the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Tattoos did not show any signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I was just 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That is life-making.
Again, Abbott removed six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no trace of tumors visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very demanding.
You have to think of practical things - about money, if I am no longer, for example, or my wife shows how the Boilertiming is working.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
They must look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents, it is difficult," he says.
It is difficult to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I would have a disease that I would not be aged with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and carefree.
She told her friends and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was more restrained.
She did not say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients need to do.
But for mesothelioma, such talks are not overcome by hope, not one of hope for survival.
The disease (as it is also for Stephen Jay Gould) is a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increase in calls for democratic reform, for the nomination of candidates in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate.
It was presumably the long-planned protests in Hong Kong's business district that followed, while activists tended to plan and mobilize them within a matter of hours.
The elections of the People's Republic of China, in principle, allow Communist leaders to reject all non-contributory candidates.
"This doesn't come unexpectedly, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of China's decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that admission of public nominations to Hong Kong's government would be "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain had withdrawn from Hong Kong's control over Hong Kong, Beijing promised to let the residents elect the government seat as from 2017.
China's leaders represented the Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives Hong Kong's citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that China's leaders remain firm in their hands through a closely-controlled Nomination Committee.
After a new clause, only candidates will be allowed "with love for the country and love to Hong Kong."
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong's biggest protests have been taking place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, the organizers of which have threatened to seal off the financial district if Beijing does not allow for universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within a few hours, hundreds of Occupy Central helicopters had gathered in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and in the coming weeks they planned to plan protest waves.
However, they did not provide any information on this, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers agreed that the "occupation of the central county" was considered only as the last resort, an action that only takes place if all dialogue options have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted today and the occupation of the central county will definitely take place.
In Hong Kong, the authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days and increased security measures, including police forces and barricades on Sunday, in front of the government building.
The unrest is exacerbated by the sense of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Moreover, the fear that the values of Hong Kong's like democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under pressure from Beijing's growing pressure.
Some were criticized in the Occupy-Central movement, as it threatened the business operations - the Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests they talk could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long it will last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has been critical of the movement for a long time.
We do not want to raise concerns about the fact that Hong Kong is out of control.
That impression is bad for investment.
The state controlled media of China also recently reported democracy activists in Hong Kong as Western powers controlled subversive agents.
During this summer, organised activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights of 780.000 people - more than one-fifth of the electorate in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of them participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The traditions of school-leaving stables in the United States are now transferred to universities where Freshmen are offered with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the UK's first luxury travel service to students from today.
In order to be able to reach a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport services such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also made the point that the service was a security force.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise have to pay their belongings in a dangerous car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with minimum effort and a maximum of luxury.
A business speaker said that no new bookings have been made since the service was first introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the coming weeks."
The company also announced that, despite the tuition fees of 9,000 £/ year, there will be a market for this offer.
Students today are different in their expectations and requirements very different from the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
The National Student Union was, however, critical of the service.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who begin this month with studies are facing a crisis of living costs, since the available financial support in the form of loans and scholarships does not take into account the soaring bills for the most basic reasons of life, before they can even think about producing thousands of pounds like arrival in the student residence.
Feminists criticise racial question and police behaviour after Ferguson
At the beginning of this month, the unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo..
The participants brought their hands into the air and sang, "hands high, do not shoot," while they were waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of an unarmed Teenager Michael Brown, Miriam Zoila Perez noted a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators have the gender off the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, while tensions in the Middle East rose and received attention across the country, Perez saw that the answers from white women turned to 100% against the race.
In comparison with the replies of black women shortly after the conclusions of 9 August, the personal essays on titles such as "thoughts on Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the repression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I do not think that, in feminism, there are many people who are above white and who speak for themselves in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to comment on the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnically that it must be expressed.
In English professor KFD a Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson problems brought to light that black American women are exposed every day, but they are not considered to be "women's women" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 turns from everywhere," said Mitchell.
When I hear something about how they are under siege in their own country, silence is stunned.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but do not talk about security in public space?" She asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who studied race, gender, and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the issues; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now associate the subjects of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were yellow and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history in order to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the divide between white and black women came from the point on which white fighters for women's electoral law, like Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century, establishing that the fight for electoral vote could only be successful for each group: Women or black people.
"You came up with the choice of campaigning for the right of women's electoral law, and voting rights for black should come later," said Hattery.
If you remember these things, you will be aware of why white women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to be organised against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police action, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time in which white feminists were playing "fattening" with the problems that black women faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to education of a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraceptive control?" Asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation, who started their careers on the fight for reproduction rights and access to contractionary funds, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steiner went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she asked for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race, which are markedly different in public surveys -" wrote Steiner.
Although it is a case of a rather intersectional feminism that deals with racial and gender issues, some of its comments on racial hatred in America are perplexed.
Christina Sommer, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?," said to She The People, that young men in the United States, particularly young coloured men, were "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticisms.
There are now hundreds of specific programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But, as the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that stands at the forefront of mainstreaming.
After the US border police took up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also returning to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilized women for the immigration reform, said that, for a reconsideration of the issue as an essential woman, she only has to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of the working visas to male immigrants are concerned, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a post hall in women's organisations," she said.
"Pig-house" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale has been removed by property brokers, proving that it was a large pig that had been made comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 pounds.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - one of which was a pig's head on a sofa.
Real estate agents Connells said that the pig on the photo is the owner of the owner.
"The photo was originally published and has now been removed," said a speaker from the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the earlier collection of collectors as a "one-size-detached house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the picture from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
Domestic sales generated an interest in the social media, when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to Lottowin a new millionaire
A Lottoplayer from Harvey this month came to the end of this month.
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner who will receive nearly $1.1 million on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey for the second time in five years won the jackpot in the first division, after 1 million dollars in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner has to be reported.
The shop owner Steve Forward said the profit caring for conversation material in the small city in the southwest of Perth.
The city does not speak of anything else, and everyone is quite excited about it.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners last month celebrated profits in the first division, a duly closing ceremony for a couple of happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August, after a married couple of Belmont had reached €7.5 million only a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing and said for 20 years, winning the opportunity of a world tour and buying a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the gladiatorial arena
Not only the gladiators had a very high level playing field during the first Rhine-based Roman Day in the amusement park.
However, the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1000 visitors yesterday to resist the rain and the autumn cold.
There was a colourful range of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the Roman period and its significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Corinthian fighter force from the "Amor Mortis" school, which used every freeze to demonstrate their robust combat show in the Arena with soft sand.
Gladiators "leonidas" turned out to be a humorous and knowledgeable presentator, and in turn sent their men into the Ring for the heroic war in various gladiators.
At first, the "provocators" were on the row with a rectangular sign and a short coat and the right arm on the left leg and the armchair on the left leg.
The "Essedarii" was followed by a chest, a short coat, a neck and an iron gladiator, bass and armguard.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "RETIARIUS," which joined with the "SECUTOR" and "SECUTOR," and after a short battle, the burners struggle.
In this way, the heavy metal parts, the shields and the seedlings have been flocking through the arena, for example, that a fear and bite could be the health of gladiators.
However, the imposing "Summa Rudis," of the musculous referees, had an always attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman life and make the culture of the Roman Age a reality," said Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friends of the Roman Channel," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park for one day became an "Oppidum Romanum," a Roman city, like Vice-Chairman Claus Ruage in his greeting word.
After all, the Romans did not only represent war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
There was also the Roman day, for instance "aqueduct marble" of the 11-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Roman canal bridge, which stood at the end of the day at Saturelberg.
The Frontinus society was once and now representing water and energy supply, and business leader Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge from then."
This is confirmed by the diploma surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "Engineering Team 2" from Rheinbach, the surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations carried out in 1894, as well as bricks from the original hypodermis, the hot-air heat, which used to heat up the Roman villa.
Impressive even the footprints made by wolf and fox in front of two millennia of clay before they burned.
In 2011, the office for ground preservation at the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa at the Nord Industrial Park Nord in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building have been rebuilt with a darre for drying grain and colder.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural good, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass basket, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and a tiny necklace.
The villa was originally from the first to the fourth century after Christ until the founding of the Germanic people in the then Roman Rhineland, suspected Morscheiser.
In her work, the children also took part in the Roman wind test game, similar to the present-day mill game, or they wrote their names with metal grip points on wax boards like the Roman students.
At the state of the Roman thermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay the mosaics themselves, at the booth of the glass museum Rheinbach Glasmosaiken and at the level of the Eifel Nettersheim, a heavy wheat mill from stone to put flour for a bread or a cereal.
Due to the two cold-blooded original Roman tourist cars the visitors took their way through the park and were also present at the impressive booth of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks."
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the Municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the city of Wachtberg in 2014, which was intended to remind Emperor Augustus of the death of Emperor Augustus in 2000 years.
Together with their home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the association of association and the leisure club Oberbachem, there are other thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes and the Roman history of Wachsing.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will tell about his work at the zuste Wachtberg, which presents plants as living places of thought from the Roman era, and a fun teaching hour in terms of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and attributed to the Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is devoted to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week the numerous, often but no longer at first sight, visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg can be explored again.
A small presentation of the settlement of the Berkumer was remembered in 1879 in the Wachtberg City Hall.
Ebola: The epidemic is affecting West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned and international companies are at distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic hit the economy of West Africa a heavy blow.
The harvest is rotated in fields, mines are leaving and the markets are orphaned - the virus has made it difficult for the region.
Some international companies are already on distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," he shares the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit.
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second-largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus alone, but there are more than 600 people falling victim to the fever.
Recently, health authorities declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, thousands more were killed.
Foreign companies pulling staff from
Companies use their operations in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies, such as the Arcelor-Mittal steel sector, are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines no longer fly.
And local traders and farmers are also reacting: Only a few merchants are leaving their homes to obtain supplies.
In some of the areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the export of important cocoa and coffee beans to the fields.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for harvesting.
Foodstuffs are scarce.
"People become less and less travel," says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Paris expert on the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who usually goes on the market and sells his vegetables better off at home.
The population, therefore, receives the consequences of the epidemic direct and pressing: Food is scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foods like rice is waning.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international firms threatens an image - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies usually reject the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon from the French Think Tank Iris.
The most important thing is how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, "warns Hugon.
The disease also suffers from the strained state budgets of the states
The disease also suffers from the already strained national budgets of the states concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets are heavily strained by high spending on the health system, and in addition to the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the affected countries with 60 million dollars (EUR 45 million).
The effects are also evident in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern capital Delta has not been affected.
For many people, however, many people remain at home in fear of contagion.
Even reservations made in hotels will be significantly reduced.
Protecting the 50th Anniversary of the Year
The association "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12-14 September.
The preparations for the 50-year old founding firm of 12-14 September are going on high-tours.
It is planned on Friday, 12 September, a great entertainment evening with the "Dorfrocker" group.

A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 permanent dames with their Dirndln.
Festival chapel is the brass band Berngau.
The patronage was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" was born in 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime, in 1937, had led to the dissolution of the association.
In 1964, another 19 young men were found on April 30th, in the inn Luke the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau.
Karl March and Adolf Ried introduced the association as protectors through a difficult starting period in which it was primarily concerned to find a local club and install the shooting operation.
Already in the fall of 1965, the competition club in the "Leininger" was launched with two teams in the race competitions.
In the ensuing years, the sports, which have now been organized in seven teams, were established in all classes up to the 1st GauLeague.
The club records yearly and the magic limit of 380 rings was achieved for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the power of the active shooter has increased, the membership numbers have also become positive.
After the association "Leininger" was no longer able to meet the demands of a modern defence association, then the then Executive Board, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future residence in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis" ("Landgasthof Härteis").
After a working performance of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988, the priest Strasser for the new protégés was granted the ecclesiastical blessing.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaushoot, connected with the festive pasture of the new protectors in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a villain group was established.
Josef Schmalzl was sent to Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllter" and for the association as a whole was the direction of the Bavarian Böllertreffen 2005.
In many hours the club members modernized the rooms and the firing range at the Berngauer Hof last year and brought them up to date.
Eleven teams in round competitions
The sporting achievements of the competition club can also be taken into consideration.
In total, eleven teams currently compete in the race competitions: Six air gun teams, an air gun team, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi degree, and Kerstin Keller, in the round of 2013 / 14 from the highest league in Schützengau ANB, rose up in the regional league 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml have increased from Gauleague North to the Gaul.
In addition to the shooting range, there are events such as crabs, carnival and royal football, club flights and Christmas festivities.
You can also take a look at the festivals in the parish church.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident on return to the race track.
Tony Stewer's return to the circuit ended roughly halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove for the second time against the wall after his right front end in lap 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car to the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader, Chad Johnston, said that his 14-mate team was disappointed, but now focus on the next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.

"I have received good hopes on a good result today," said Johnston, and added: "It simply didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, stewer car was loaded into the smugglers and the team had been ready and ready for departure.
Stewart took over three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit another driver on an Aschenbahn race in the north of the State of New York and killed.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in pursuit.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., which was put on the track during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities have informed on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will last for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken on whether or not Stewart will charge a charge.

Ukraine's Army abandoned Luhansk Airport
Pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise in eastern Ukraine.
After heavy battles, which purport to be Russian armoured soldiers, the Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk, the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk today, Monday.
The army also said that seven soldiers were killed in the past 24 hours.

NATO wants to break agreements with Russia
NATO, due to the planned deployment in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis, will not break its agreement with Russia.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday that NATO was in line with the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council in 1997.
But NATO's chief accused Russia of "a stark break" of the agreement.
"Today, we must face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," so Rasmussen.
From documents and opinions from the Russian side, it shows that they regard us as adversaries.
Stronger NATO presence
It has also announced that the NATO presence in Eastern Europe should be strengthened.
The "Readiness Action Plan," at the NATO summit in Wales, will ensure that we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is needed, "said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agreed on new gas talks
According to official figures, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new approaches to the settlement of their gas strikes.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still waiting for a European Union decision, whether it also gives a representative to the talks.

Last but not least, the EU-Energy Commissioner, Günther Oettinger, was mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also break gas supplies for Europe.
Europe covers around one third of its gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power: Tolls will be "very clear"
Now, once again, the Chancellor has made a clear commitment to this.
It is not a licence for all complicated details, however.
Strong concerns from the Christian Democrats against the toll on car tolls have increased considerably.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken, after sustained resistance from her CDU, for the introduction of a car toll.
"To be clear, it stands in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the leader of the CDU on Monday after the meetings of the CDU-top panel in Berlin.
But for a detailed model, Merkel has not been determined for the time being.
In the black-red government program, there are "certain parameters."
German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal and is now working on. "
However, the NRW-CDU Democrats insist on a 'no' toll on all roads.
Merkel emphasized that finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) has also made a constructive contribution to the debate on a bill.
Over and above the subject, he also talked about further ways of enabling more private capital to invest in infrastructure, including broadband.
"There is nothing special about it,", on Sunday, "Schäuble had left a" mirror "report uncommented, his house tested his own concept to pay off motorway investors with toll revenue - after the election in 2017.
Christian leader, Horst Seehofer, warned that, in the Cabinet, toll could be directed against the lead minister.
The Federal Government's Federal Government, Armin Laschet, confirmed its objections.
"The coalition agreement was never intended to shoot all circular and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian Christian Democrats.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that it will discuss the subject again.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDU national associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is that toll tolls are hampering the small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had been required from the ranks of the CDU Coalition for the reason of his toll criticism.
The left view the plans in the face of the dispute in the Union as a failure.
"The Murks toll toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "New Occupational Rücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll of the minister," Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which will start in 2016.
However, according to the coalition agreement, car owners must not be subjected to additional charges.
Therefore, they should be given full compensation for the tolls on the vehicle tax.
The model should not, however, penalise foreign drivers, under EU law, because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A britin says that it was thought as a consequence of misdiagnosis for many years that it would die.
Karin Rodgers spent almost her entire youth in believing that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another illness.
She was actually suffering from Charcot-Marie Tooth (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
For us, CMT UK has announced that misdiagnosis is a frequent problem for people with CMT, because so little about this disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which may lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unstable and curvature.
The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms are getting worse.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she had a very poor chance of survival in Friedreich-Ataxie (IAs).
Rodgers thought she was sitting in wheelchairs before she was 18 and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who are 51 years old today said: "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same thing as the others.
I went out and everything took me longer.
I was never able to go with the other children, a skating shoe or skateboard, and was often used in school in order to walk and walk.
Rodgers said that in the age of 13 years, after several operations to grant discharge of its Achilles' s and her feet, she saw her illness when her doctor had left the room and read that she had an FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I did not tell anyone, but I went home, looked after the disease in the library and wrote to the FA-company," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and horrified to panic.
I thought that I would be 18 in the wheelchair and I was killed with 25 and in between, I slowly lose all my abilities.
I did it all by myself and planned my own funeral.
She noted that when she was 17, she knew that her skills had not been as strong as she had presented and asked her her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "my love, I do not think you've that, or you are now in wheelchairs now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
According to some genetic tests, their CMT was established.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Team CMT UK has launched a CMT-Awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Domain-field webel, A. D. Berni Diether has been working since the closure of the former army of troops as a fireman.
For almost ten years, no longer have been shot on the former troop level in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, every month now, deadly ammunition is appearing at the very heart of the region of Schwäbische Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be blown up on the ground.
A deafening bang in the explosions at the heart of the Biosphere Area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was shot on the pitch, which was closed after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005.
From this time the 6500 hectares large area is at the heart of a Biosphere Area Swabian Alb, which is open on 13 marked paths for hikers and cyclists.
Taxes on business in the Washington Square are rising with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax breaks for firms in the country grew slightly over the past year, while the economic recovery accelerated, so a recent study was published last week, and the Washington region was no exception.
Companies in the District District, Maryland and Virginia, collectively pay $27.6 billion in government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8% over 2012, amounting to $26.6 billion.
Last year, the state and local tax burden on companies increased by 4.3% to €671 billion, compared with 3.9% in the year, and it was the third growth year of the year 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3%, according to the study carried out by the Ernst & Young service agency, Ernst & Young, with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the country's tax revenue, 56%, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of Wen's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, yields the lowest tax revenues from companies.
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery of the company's real estate assets, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7% this year after the three consecutive years, with growth rates of less than 1%.
While much of these gains from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the government appears to be taking place in Washington.
Corporations in the District, Maryland, and Virginia pay more than $10 billion in government and local real estate taxes over the past year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2% over a year.
But the apparent recovery of property values in Maryland is not so effective in raising government and local tax revenues, as property taxes amount to just over more than one-fifth of the tax firms.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, the following: A large part of the real estate, particularly in the control area of D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay for property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
It is therefore necessary to rely on income tax, for example, to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be expected simply to recover the housing market.
Business revenues also appear to be recovering, so the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on government organizations of $2.3 billion, compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
It took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, local tax burdens on companies do not increase evenly across all three locations.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3% of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported an underaverage tax rate of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6% in all three areas of office, has had a very low level of income tax (all three of them have fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8,25 percent and district with a relatively high level of 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, less government and local business taxes would be required and a better tax climate would be better than in Maryland.
The District has not been examined in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5% next year.
If the government continues to reach its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the country's income tax rate by 2017 to 3%.
In the meantime, small businesses seem to be better off Washington, and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure for which most small businesses are organised - in the District, Maryland, and Virginia increased by 20% to €2.4 billion last year, a significant faster rate of growth than corporate taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes all over the country will probably last this year, with an increase in the overall majority support tax revenue for the State and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 in comparison with the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the space of Washington may be lagging behind if the federal government's spending cuts affect the region's labor market.
Part of the City: German beer for Guangzhou
Hop and malt, even in China, is a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt Partner city in China now wants a brewery and hopes for a flight-direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of officials in China.
"We would be pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the Vice-Party Secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a Social Democratic delegation in his city.
Time and time again, the ruling Communist Party's ruling Communist Party has returned to this concern of the Twelve-million metropolis during the interview.
Guangzhou, known in Germany as canton, is one of the richest cities of China, warb Li.
That is why people also have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian Social Democratic Party leader Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, said to the host that he would listen to a potential partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer, it does not require much: Good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the leader of Guangzhou.
This joy of life radiates him from Mr. Li, he flattered to the host.
There was the function of Guangzhou with Schäfer-Gümbel, but with red wine served to eat.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back on German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business transactions
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a flight-direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Chairman Li.
The Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but was cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," the local government was convinced.
"Business between our two cities continues to grow."
At present, travellers would have to take a detour via Changsha in the province of Hunan, charged Li.
Even the administration of Guangdong Province, the capital of Guangzhou, hopes for the flight.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," answered Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese vice-minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nickable in agreement.
Quality partnership
The liberal Vice-party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year.
Li Yiwei was already in the Main, but still not in this feature.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor had been promoted for corruption charges.
The local leader, Wan Qinglian, also had to go.
The action taken against officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and government, enforced by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company in front of his party career, something that is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top-of-the-art company in Fujian, where he built a large plant.
Frankfurt is officially more than a dozen city twinning.
The connection to the airport of Guangzhou is one of the ways in which it is maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the German-China link celebrated the 25-year-old existence of the German-China link.
With its economic strength, the South Chinese metropolis is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse.
Next year she wants to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "expresses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since it was delivered to a hospital in New York City three days ago; her daughter, however, was optimistic today that the 81-year-old woman recovered from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said today in a communication.
We press all the thumbs up.
According to her mother, according to his mother, there was a hospital at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville endoscopy at Mount Sinai.
The doctors hold them deliberately and carefully, until they are satisfied with their state of satisfaction, which continues to be described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sites, including in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Sustainable vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners who are coming to trade from now on, stricter environmental standards will apply in future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from 1 September will receive a label on which the buyer can recognize central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, the "Euro 6" pollutant category contains more stringent nitrogen oxide values.
Moreover, there is more money for scaffolding: A uniform minimum wage of €10.25 per year.
Amazon Buy Twitch for USD 1.04 billion
Amazon confirmed just what information had been reported on Monday morning: Online retailers - and video manufacturers, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US $970 million).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but that it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to the video service provided by Google for a super-billion-dollar video service, and the cooperation appeared, of course.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago when Justin.tv was founded, was started as a general tracking service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it soon became a platform for players who wanted their bravaways in games to be released in games, a "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in the better known (mostly older) games, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube Twitch has wanted to buy is a little bored, a textbook example of an established technical company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not occur because, according to the undertakings, it was prepared to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything that we know about at the moment, is this statement by Emmet Siss, President of Twitch: "We decided to Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, to be honest, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who say that they prefer to play sport than seeing them, it is difficult to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others playing at games rather than performing the control panel.
It is one thing to look at a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning, while living through Resident Evil, and something completely different to see how he rotates 20 times a day in Call of Duty.
You can now watch all of these games now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are today's ego games, so there is a good recipe for headaches without control over the eye-eye view.
I admit that the fast treads, in which the Roger Banners of our electronic age complete games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as there isn't a game or a humorvirtuoso, its twitch channel is probably not so very interesting.
But what do skeptics know like I do?
Twitch is called from 55 million visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated in Amazon Instant Video, just like YouTube Twitch could have swallow.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to have: Thousands of young men who are called advertisers.
Like the chairman of Twitch, Sunch, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium does not show any signs of contraction, not even - sip - as a spectator sport.
At the rear of the castle there was a lot of fun on Saturday evening.
The concept of the organisers agreed.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times the admission had to be stopped.
"It was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt-precious l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
For the open air in the salt-precious castle garden is expected to shine on the day and in the evening by various shows.
Well, and the fun is anyway on its own.
This was already at the beginning of the evening when the first visitors came to the Open Air.
A feast for all generations, the organizers had promised.
And they managed to do so.
Around the supply levels in the castle garden, salt-precious, and even guests from closer and more distant surroundings had been cosily made.
They took the first live performances, with the foot in the course, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: Pure relaxation and enjoyment were guaranteed.
And all right through the generations.
While one has a ceiling on the covered white sand beach at the beach bar, some of which were at a quarter of the wine in the Vinothek, the young ones went up on the hips, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
However, even in the case of child children's children's children, the volunteers were literally doing their best to master the crowd of Lord and conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces.
The makers used the Kickertische or participated in a skateboard workshop, which designed the Goodfoot crew out of salt.
Until the Great rain came.
Just before 5.30 p.m. prasselte felt to the visitors, especially families sought the vastness and drying.
But the attraction of the festival did not disrupt it.
"There were more people than expected," Ron Sem said, saying "success on the whole line."
So a repeat of the big party next year will not be possible.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked out, Sem made a first record on Sunday against the Volksionme.
It was annoying that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped.
Apparently the security company was booked with too little effort.
As a result, some people who had already paid out came out of the terrain.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the salt-precious co-organizer of about 1200 visitors took part in the castle garden.
There were problems with clay.
The salt-noble hip hop band blocks'n'Rox crashed their appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably sound sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt-top due to a tyre block.
"In the next year they will be," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was more than achieved by visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made a number of errors, which will have to be withdrawn for the first time, but will have to be eliminated in the second edition.
The organisers will also have to criticise the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but for more than 12 Euros you can easily find anything," says Melanie Meier on the Events page.
"You have unfortunately taken a bit of it a bit," Ele Zimmermann believes in the same job.
Others are not so close to the initial problems.
I think it is very good that some people are not only stupid, but also really trying to put something on their feet.
Hats off! "Writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
The organisers will now have a time to put a stop to these points of criticism.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachberg's landmarks are shrinking.
That is not the case, as far as we are concerned.
Instead, the built-in part is waiting to be used in a significant building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Nearly 50 years after the establishment of the TIRA space observation radar, the so-called Radom is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 metres.
However, the size still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the Kappentausch.
The upper quarters of the old shell are separated and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new shell is set.
If the weather is good, the action will take place at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge surpasses jaws.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom did so much when her icy water was poured over the head, that she left the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket Challenge was painful.
A woman was sent to hospital after she had so much trouble with the Ice-Bucket Challenge that she had left the jaws.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain did so much when her icy water was poured over the head, that she deposed her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did the deed, my jaws were simply stand," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is distributed over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts several seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that did not go to the jaws, and then I understood that something was not right.
My mother and sister saw this and made themselves almost in the pants, but I had to go into the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was sent to hospital to re-release the jaws after taking part in the virals trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the Burgundy clubs soon be joining forces?
Last but not least, there were again between the two Wolfratshauser Burgundy.
Now the hubs are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgundy, performed the project in the French Guédelon.
Only a year ago there was no good climate between the castle club and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.
The points of view so far differently seem to have been dealt with in the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction.
Now, the two camps are moving towards each other: There will soon be talks on joint action.
This is confirmed by the associations of Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (castle-lovers) on demand of our newspaper.
"I have called Mr Piffl and proposed that we could sit down together," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both clubs could once again pull together in the future.
There has been much more visible success.
During the castle fans around the sudden Richard Dimbath, to the last a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, the Burgverein around Sjöberg stands at the forefront of the "development and experience of the terrain."
Herbert Piffl, Chairman of the Borough of Burgundy, has been very pleased about the call.
He has been in favour of the castle's friends since Liu's death.
A new president will be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
Currently, the club has about 40 members, according to the 74-year-olds.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we left the association's activities out of respect first." Thought was necessary to consider how to proceed. "
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then meet with the castle club.
Until then, the castle lovers might be able to present a current mood in their group.
There is not yet another candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to continue working on the project. "
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffl in the near future.
It honours Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Similarly, much more advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea was not an air strike.
Due to a high participation of the population as well as volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "Even I was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time I have gained more and more convinced that it makes sense to move the project forward. "
There is nothing else here.
Moreover, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor-tickets and potential sponsors.
"The idea of reconstruction is something that I personally do not want to throw away on board." He hopes that the Burgverein may perhaps move somewhat on that point.
Their aim, first of all, to document history, "is important and good."
You can see that on that basis.
Clever ways to save university textbooks
As the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the fast and bilingual student student Matt Schroeder presented a clever saving idea.
He found a loan system for books of higher semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale.
"My mathematical book usually costs 180 $, but I received it for 10 $for a semester and a chick-fil-A-Kek," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
There was 120 $.
The Board of Directors informed students, on average, more than 1,200 dollars annually for textbooks and study material, but that there were various cost-benefit options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches like the Schroeder are increasingly the choice for students.
The rents of textbooks become more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that the rents of text books have doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores were rented in the last spring year, Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks will be purchased on campus bookstores according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-to-one for the best deals.
Purchasing Online Buy
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookshop.
The ninth issue of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased at the specialist textbook retailer Chegg.com for 239.99 $.
Buying Can Buy
If one of the notes of other or normal usage tracks do not make anything, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" needs to be available on Chegg.com for 93.49 $.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduation student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand issue of "Strategic Media Decision: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was re-released for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether they were allowed to spend.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older issues can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting of apartments
The renting of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to return them and you do not want to retain the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80% of the costs of a new book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for about $20 for the duration of a semester.
Find out more about the terms of the business you rent, including the penalties applicable for writing notes, undercoats and usage tracks.
Hirer reserves the right: If you do not return the book, the charges of a new book may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
Even e-books, rather than traditional textbooks, are an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic licence for a certain period of wholesale retailers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for about $61 for 6 months.
Bracey says that students in literature often find the best deals, as many classic classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while academic and academic literature can be very expensive.
In any case.
Joe Gault, 29, who will shortly be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN-number for the pricing in books, as you can be sure of finding the right textbook.
And before placing an online order, you should check whether the book is in stock.
This lesson learned the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookshop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" has not been a Cash off
"The Expendables 3" from Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of America's $90 million budget in the US while "Sin City: A lady to Kill For" recorded only $12 million of its budget of $70 million.
The "Sex Tape" movie, tailored to Cameron Diaz, played only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, whereas children's films such as "Dragon thighs easily make 2" as well as revenue.
An article from the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that children's films themselves could be the reason for the children's films.
"The worst year" in 2014 as "the worst year" previously described for children's films and described "Dragon thighs easily made 2" as a mere "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, for films for a slightly older target group, it seems as though the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average Cinemascoring and Metacritic evaluation for every summer film start that was demonstrated between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 canvases.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and suggests that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators say that the development of changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix is the result.
Director Jon Favreau, who currently works on Rage's soon-appearing jungle book movie, said to Hollywood reporter's website: "I think the times change."
We have to accept this and do not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current low-ranking results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently reached $1.2 billion in streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, in which revenues amounted to 837 million dollars.
In the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on films of comics and prophesied a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy could well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash presence expected in the summer of 2015, such as the Age of Ultron, Minions, and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclically" and said to Hollywood reporters: "The next summer will be the biggest summer on the cinema, and no one will worry about the business."
A few years ago, the 2nd table of tables on the table was cancelled out in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Association has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga.
The result: Who has not risen up has increased.
In the last season, however, gods of the highest-ranking team Torpedo in the Oberleague-Relegation have avoided the descent, but only five-fifths of the next season.
Fourth-class status remains for Torpedos women, despite their grandiose cross-border in the regional league.
The boys and girls from torpedo start in the nested league, as well as the boys of the SC Weuss.
The SG Lengders and the Torpedo reserve are part of the new Association League, in the National League no longer a divinity club is represented.
Women plays the TTV Geismar in the League's League, the Torpedo-second in the National League.
What kind of composition looks like a better class class, now is the new district league of South.
Here TSV Seulingen, Vice-President VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district league as regional representative Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the area of the TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III, the official ranking of the women begins at least in determination strength.
Cronies, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllnsausen are starting to launch in the regional league.
With 9 teams each
The SC Weeper sends his girls to the small regional league.
Also, the regional league season of the SCW boys - there is also Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded Region of the Region of the Region, the two derelict teams were held by nine teams each.
In the West Series are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfeld SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengders II.
In the eastern part of the city there are other cities like Sattenhausen / Wöllistan ausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Ladies County League consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllistan ausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode district, where there are no female teams at the circular level.
What is striking about the fact that none of the six 2.2 circle groups have reached a higher level, where the innovative and round-racing director will have to think about it.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend, there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds were gathered in the centre of Newport to an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, around 150 people were joined in Cardiff in front of the town hall there, in order to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has watched the developments on the weekend and talked with demonstrators who have travelled to Belgium.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains were flown out
Two young landlords were brought to safety after they were trapped in NSW on the night via the Blue Mountains.
The 16-year-old girl and 19-year-old man collapsed shortly after noon in Govett Leap in Blackheath on her tour.
Worried relatives called the police at about 20 p.m., when the two did not return home.
A search bar from local police and rescue services broke out and the pair was found around about 23 p.m. near the Galleria Veil waterfalls.
The girl had turned on its knees and the man was overthrown and beaten his head.
Rescue forces remained overnight at the pair, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were supplied in a stable state with a ambulance in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Anti-Palestinian protests in Pakistan escalates
The approximately 1000 demonstrators were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said information minister Pervaiz Rashid.
After much half an hour, the station took off again.
PTV-Director Athar Farooq has said that devices equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editors.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the Heads of Government, who accuse them of electoral fraud.
The police told us that about a kilometre away from the residence of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there were more than 3,000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
After hospitalization, a policeman was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured, as demonstrators attempted to invade Sharifs Residenz.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The mighty military had called on a political solution to the conflict, on Sunday evening, after a meeting in the army's headquarters, "without wasting time and using force."
The communication states that 'the army will remain committed to ensuring the security of the state'.
The escalating violence has aroused concern from military intervention, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Preacher Tahirul Qadri protests last since the Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday.
"We will not fall, without being forced to resign without Sharif," Khan said.
Qadri was similar.
Khan throws Sharif to have won the parliamentary election last May by means of fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the Central and provincial governments.
In that way, a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the government quarter.
The demonstrators had, first, peacefully before the parliament, until Khan and Qadri defeated them on the weekend to invade Sharifs Residenz.
Hrüdorfer after two years of victory on place three of the table.
With the 2-0 above, for Rapid a bitter end for Rapid a bitter end.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate level on Thursday at the European League.
"The success of the event was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who came to three with green-white.
Jumping on winning Road Rapid, with the second round of the season, has shown the right response to the disappointment at Helsinki, with a successful experience in the country game break.
"What we wanted to do was a positive response," said outside defending Thomas Schrig, who, with his splendid driving experience on the sixth-minute stage, set the course for victory.
"I thought I was wearing the whole shake of the day and took him under the carpet," said the 26-year-old smiling.
This was the last time he had hit Ried on November 13, 2010.
Therefore, the first championship leader in the Rapid-Dress will remain in a special memory.
"For me, this is something special, I am, of course, from the rapid young man," he said.
Mario Pavelic's short-term crankel founds the left on the right defensive side and made his case very good there too.
He has enough experience that he will also be able to exercise that position.
The gate has earned him a degree of assimilation, "he praised Barisic.
Team shows character foes also supplied the flank to 2: 0 by Hofmann after an hour that finally took the decision.
Before that, the guests might well have to be able to write about it.
"Thank God we have had a good luck today," he also noted the fact that the difference between performance and results in recent weeks has shown that "the results have not been voted, but the playwright has always been well compared to last year."
Barisic was even better known in many games than today, "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season."
The first three-point point since 26 July, therefore, demonstrated that the team structure has remained intact despite the setbacks, "today, my team has shown that it has character."
For him, he was no less pleased: 'That we at last played back to zero'.
A lot of work during the period of national action also has the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting loads, make the victory even more valuable.
"One must not forget that," Barisic warned, who over the past three days had become very stable in the hands of the Berber and Pavelic players. "
The country changeover period should therefore be used to liven up the wounds and the physical field, "said Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in its ranks.
One who seems to be particularly well-off is captain Hofmann.
It dries up for the team, it goes over pain.
At this heavy stage he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his confusion in the 68th minute, not only the structure, but also the second gate.
For the 33-year-old, who earned his 350 Bundesliga match, it was the first hit from November 2, 2013 (4: 2 about the admira).
Hofmann: "Can not believe that everything is fine now" "We certainly have been a little luck, but at some point the luck will have to come back to us.
Now it was high time, "Hofmann said.
He did, however, pay attention to concentrated work: "You can't always see it black and white.
We have not played so badly in recent weeks, as has been pointed out.
We cannot, however, believe that everything is fine now.
He couldn't deny the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can help at the moment.
They refer to me in certain phases, "said Hofmann.
Michael Baur's coach, Michael Baur, had little to blame himself and his team.
He regretted the high-speed opponent "from the caster", as well as the regular Tor of Nutz in the 40th minute, wrongly recognized by referee collegger.
The only criticism that I can make to the team is that we do not have enough concrete steps towards Tor in some stages.
We have had too few qualifications.
Interior defenders of Maximilian Karner saw it in a similar way: "It has started badly, but then we have found out and even made a Tor.
By and large, it would have been more relevant.
There is a rush on the ground in the near future.
A mighty tribe we showed in our ridding of the summer series "My song from Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still part of the county, the extracted copy is the "scourges" above the Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree.
It goes past Koppeln, basalt and basalt rocks.
A bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
It is a natural monument, it rises above the other trees of the region and reminds us about eight metres away from an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a smokescreen indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intense research, however, there were only references to the names of the names.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and interviewed the older people from Unterweißenbrunn to learn about the preservation of the plague.
The results of his research were the rather sober explanation for his name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds had driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn out of the labyrinths and stones liberated by stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animals who were exhausted by the climb should have been robbed.
In the meantime, the area has lost its significance, as in the meadows, there are more than goat herds.
The area has also been identified as the core area of the Biosphere Reserve.
You should be careful when entering the stone collections, because the basalt, which is warmed by the sun, is also a popular resting place for cruises.
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but hidden hidden.
Other ways are signposted, take the direction of Hochrhön and invite you to a long walk.
Where is the water castle?
However, a Wasserburg, who is looking for the next job, is relatively rare.
The mirroring in the ditch gives a good impression of the building, but in the district there are some historical buildings to which the building can be adapted.
Where is our "piece of the world's happiness"?
My Heart of Rhöner Glück
As with previous series of the main post last years, there will be prizes again this year if they find the right solution.
Anyone who likes to photograph can also participate.
From the e-mail address red.neustadt @ mainpost.de you can send us the solution and your personal "piece of the song" happiness "under this keyword.
The most beautiful photos will be published.
After weeks of succession, Italy's prime minister and president-in-office, Matteo Renzi, opposed strong conservative resistance at the EU summit meeting last week to appoint Secretary of State Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, you will be the successor of the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, like the government-friendly newspaper La Repubblica, sees the appointment of his Mogherini government as Favorably as the strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost to his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes that it will also keep the line-up on the left side of the party, because Mogherini will be assigned to it - albeit in a moderate manner.
In the face of conservative representatives with the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, the dominant opinion in Rome, made a political balance.
The EU's chief diplomacy, at the same time, is the deputy of the President of the Commission, Juncker.
The pending consent of the European Parliament is considered to be safe.
In other words, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly be able to nominate the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important acknowledgement" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the mogherini's "enormous challenges" have been demonstrated for almost two decades in leading party offices, and for their ambition.
Born Roman in is married and has two daughters.
In 1996, her party career started his doctorate in political science in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left-of-Democrats), who joined in 2008 with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita to today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini was Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Jungsocialist Societies) for three years.
In 2001, the election of the People's Party of Left Democrats rose into high party politics, and in the Department of Foreign Affairs, of which she was a director.
They occupy traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, were known by studies on NATO action in Afghanistan, where Italy was involved with a troop contingent, the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
She has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2008 and is an expert on defence and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, Mogherini became his foreign minister.
If the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country that contributed more than 40% of the party's vote in May's EU elections, Federica Mogherini, as noted in PD circles, has a share in it.
The thinking in Brussels, the new EU external representative, has had too little diplomatic experience, so there is a lack of substance in the PD.
In Brussels, particularly by Poland and the Baltic Member States, there has been a mistrust of fashion for the crisis in Ukraine and diffused as a "sojourn-friendly course."
It endorses the South Stream pipeline by Russia's Gazprom-led pipeline, via which Russian gas can be transported directly to southern Europe, and that also serves energy security for Italy.
After taking office as President of the EU in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow.
Photos taken by Putin at the Shake hands were greeted with indignation in Brussels, just as they invited the Kremlin's head for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at EMZ-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.

The Socialists in France should "keep their mouth and put France in order," said the main ally of François Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deep split left to show "her love" for the disputed socialist president, whose cabinet-building was defeated by the great majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, it deserves our loyalty, it deserves our support.
"It's our duty to remain on his side," he said in great applause.
As a appeasingly gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government did not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite fierce calls for a relaxation of the regulation by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his co-Socialist colleagues to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister for Justice, entered the conciliation process, where she had a meeting of renegade socialist members, and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in its future."
Naval Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, has broken down the permanent graves of the socialists and said that she cannot imagine that the new Valls government will hold for more than a couple of months.
François Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, it is forced to form a new government if the old hasn't survived one summer.
"And the new one will also not survive the autumn or winter," said milling a Le Pen against supporters.
She repeated the call of her party for a dissolution of Parliament and said that she had confidence to emerge in pre-election as winner and be ready for government.
The ruling party in France suffered a defeat at the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey conducted in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76% of French people feel that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions at the end of the term of Hollande's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would lose patience if the new Socialist government did not make improvements to the economy and record-breaking jobs.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may deteriorate further.
Miami Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of €3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the third largest cruise carrier in the world, carries out advanced negotiations on the acquisition of Prestige Cruises International Inc.
A deal would give a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy clientele while competing with major rivals like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, said the sources on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end up without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also has a 20% share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources request that they remain anonymous because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not answer requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo refused to comment.
In Miami, the Norwegian Cruise Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13% in comparison with 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also in Miami, operates under the brand name Oceania and Regent, which together comprises eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, a 6% rise in comparison with the previous year.
The cruise industry is about $29 billion in total, and in the coming years, it will be expected to expand in emerging economies like China and India over the next few years.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice.
Prestige Cruises applied the stock market to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was born in its present form in 2000 by a merger with a cross-service provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino sector under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested €1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20% of the shares and the private equity firm TPG Capital LP at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise, together according to the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises, have more than 82% of the passenger capacity in American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A measurable group moved near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law permitting only two or three candidates in Hong Kong's leadership in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the majority support of a Nomination Committee, which is expected to be associated with eligible members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote and forced pro-democracy activists to placate their threats and to paralyse Hong Kong's financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong; and China's leaders fear that the calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which the predominance of Hong Kong was set out in June, democracy activists had an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in.
Lis's survey is organised by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice-director of the Office of Foreign Affairs of Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned during the course of the day.
Student activists have announced that they will meet in the afternoon before the senior leadership in Hong Kong.
Britain saw no democratic elements until the final decision of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands Kiev to include "state-proof talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports, stated that, on Sunday, the Ukrainian Government would stop the fighting against separatism in the east of the country and immediately engage in negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later realised that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine, under the control of the separatified territory of eastern Ukraine, was a part of Russia, but that its status with Ukraine needed to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on equal terms with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy that he has apparently seen since the beginning of the five months of the riots, with the help of separatists taking part and pressure on the Ukrainian Government, in order to facilitate the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with state television channel channel 1, Putin convicted Putin's Ukrainian military campaign to re-capture the separatists held in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently described the occupied territory as "Novorossija" or "Neurestlands," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary gleam of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of Ukraine's pro-election campaigns for the elections on the 26th Oct., and while governmental groups attacked civilian communities in the territories occupied by separatists, are hoping for early peace talks, reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to start detailed discussions without delay, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of the society and the state status of the south-eastern Ukraine in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov has said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context with the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that its cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine.
The Kremlin leader's clarification on correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underlined Russia's leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, unlike the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in Ostukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period have revealed a large majority in Ukraine.
The autonomy raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thereby giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area linking Russia's territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, dating from five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy and an important commercial port and a historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries, which have important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his speech on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislation, after new elections, should consider amending the Constitution with greater control over its finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels who are accused of arming and pillaging Moscow.
Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on equal terms was followed by a further escalation of the rebels in the last week, after Russian troops and tanks invaded the former peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officers, took the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, control by Novoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have begun to force Mariupol to build a steel industry with 500,000 inhabitants, which is between Novoasovsk and narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leadership in Brussels and urged urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are at a point where there is no turning back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of other tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided not to take concrete action, the leadership required the proposal for further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force when the Ukrainian escalation of the Ukrainian crisis occurred.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers took part in the Donetsk last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, including the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk, were replaced on Sunday to 10 Russian parishes who had been taken prisoner in Ukrainian territory a week ago by Lysenko on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal about Australian promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not make any secret of his troubles over hackers, who are likely to have stolen nude pictures of his fiancees Gabi Grecko and a Who's Who of the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement, after a series of clear photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the internet.
More than 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star from "the Tribute of Panem" and superstars, including the models of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers in Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Among the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were allegedly also publicised private photos on a icloud gap.
The list can be found on the list of 101 pros.
Noblemen, who had lost Grecko last month, said to Confidential: "It is disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, at the moment in New York, said reports that the Hack was' shameful 'and that those affected were "injured."
The hacker has probably 30 images from Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which they are without a pool.
The Palmer film works belong to "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on lost images yesterday.
A representative Lawrence 'said to TMZ: "It is an abomination violation of privacy."
Actors Seth Rogen condemned the hackers in his tweet: "Chopped images from a mobile phone is nothing different than the sale of Hehlerware."
From a legal point of view, the propagation of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, the Jogger and the trekkers were the ones who took part in the 8th wheel on the Great Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the club "Help for krebliable children."
The tour, which was a tortur, was an easy training for the other people.
Everyone agrees on one thing: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski should have slept well last night.
For the first time in his lifetime, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus took place yesterday with the wheel on the Feldberg.
For the good purpose.
The small muscle moist can be easily removed, given that he personally obtained a valuable insight in his / her own personal knowledge of the 8th wheel on the Great Feldberg, for the benefit of the association "Help for Crebents Children" (Frankfurt).
A great thing.
"I know now that I can - fine!"
Do you have any problems on your way out of the applet?
If I had stopped you, you would have thought it would be...
Like Thomas Studansky, who is sitting on behalf of the CDU in the Oberurseler district parliament, many of the 718 participants died in the spring at the end of the morning in the spring and came close, but happily on the plateau.
By contrast, it was easier to overcome the 11-kilometre long line between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
The new Green Party politician - red drink, red bike - started something on understatement ("Every amount of professionals, there was the goal!"), but it turned out to be a half-time professional and went to 45 minutes without breathing in the end.
He also runs the track in a slide, as well as Nina Kuhn, a press secretary in the city of Oberursel, which, together with Frank Grüneisen, had embarked on the way.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg radon" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, here it is about charity, here it is about charity, there we are keen on here - an exit we would have made today anyway," according to Kuhn.
On the way, they had Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) was pushed to Oberursel in the morning to get back to the height.
In the morning at 9 o'clock in the saddle, the shop was at home in the saddle, "making" the Feldberg two times to play with fun.
Fun was also "Fritten-Toni."
For the head of the Oberurseler cult kiosk, bicycle tours through the Feldberg simply belong to it.
He had been hit 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racer.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - and I am happy to do so, "Andreas Balzke said.
The advanced Mainzer says that it is an "ambitious racing company."
This has to be the case, because it has been on the road with the "fixie wheel"; these are racing bikes, but without a circuit...
Even without a wheel, there were not only the 20 trekkers who climbed above the white wall and the gorge to the top of the summit, but also a jogging run, which at a Kordel mount an autoclave behind them.
There are a lot of things to do and see for yourself.
The 718 participants - and therefore as many as ever before - were sent to the track in the morning.
The trekkers are first at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers were left alone.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radden on the Great Feldberg," gave the starting posts and would wish the participants a wonderful trip.
Next year, he hopes that it will be possible to close down the line to the Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
