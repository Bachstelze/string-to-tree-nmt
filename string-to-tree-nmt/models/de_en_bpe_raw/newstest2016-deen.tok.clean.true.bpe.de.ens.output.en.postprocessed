Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and on Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state dispute that we are discussing.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes the ongoing settlement of Israel and reproaches Netanyahu for a lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama-based deal on Iran's nuclear program has worsened the relationship of the two.
In March, Netanyahu held a controversial speech at the US Congress's invitation to the US Congress, which was interpreted as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to having shot his girlfriend shot.
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb, with a slightly angry voice of the police, told him that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his home.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" still live and is probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone.
Inside the house, the officials found the corpses of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note, which was written on a white block: "I am so sorry, I was so sorry, I could reverse it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman I ever loved," according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by lamb.
There was no reference to that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises, where, according to the police, he had shot and killed a popular historian, Ethan Schmidt, on the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard the shooting at 10: 18.
He said that Lamb eventually made the fatal emergency cry.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life, when the police took him.
A day after the shooting in the university, which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to give an image of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what was said by students and employees who knew him, helped to draw an image of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.
Students said that they were happy with his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he has no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both were taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there have been some misgivings about problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, praised the Lamb, said that he also seemed somewhat excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for medical reasons and said that he had some health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
State-of-the-art changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, for which lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to recruit as assistant professor.
University's president, William LaForge, said that he knew nothing about a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea."
These are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving the campus, the police later found Lambs again, when he was back in Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner methel Johnson.
His car was still in the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this House, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He holds a PhD in pedagogy in the spring.
One of his long-time friends, Mr Lambs, called it intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by shared friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar.
He was the women's warm at the time.
All girls slept when he was there, "said hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon living.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency call lamb "I have killed my wife," but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog called lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which borders a Badu in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was in order.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen on his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but his daughter Abigail heard him that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, when he and Abigail appeared both on a summer annual market three years ago.
Later they played together one or other Gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings their own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a Barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar in the vicinity of Gautier, said that he first saw Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night of 5 September last night, after Lamb had stopped his guitar and oral harmonikaspiel finished with a slim audience.
There was no sign that something was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very good and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
I think they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, started the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the student committee.
On Tuesday evening, the Delta State Campus in Cleveland attended about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community at a candlelight commemoration.
Schmidts's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the funeral service during the university "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We try to persuade our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The main purpose of this report was to press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he was shot by Schmidt, and that lamb called Prentiss as his wife, but there was no indication that the two had ever married.
Toys R Us plan to hire fewer workers for Christmas time.
Toys R Us say that there will not be so many Christmas-season staff as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current workforce and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to close 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers all over the country.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, Christmas business is moving closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees selling, selling, and delivering products.
Michael J. Fox shears about his "Date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it is gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated gambler and an argon length of which I am away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time," a documentary about Back to the Future, presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had its premiere 30 years ago.
"It is for me really," said Spielberg, "without controversy the greatest journey film ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
A boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is "there is no military solution" to the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chairman once again calls for all parties, including the split UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France - at the margins of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran in the face of the crisis in Syria.
8 poll numbers showing that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But, no matter how some Republicans are trying to draw Donald Trump from the top ranks in polls, it has not worked (yet).
Ten of the last eleven national polls have shown Donald Trump in double-digit domains, and some are beginning to wonder seriously what it means for the chances of the nomination of Real Estate.
Of course it is still too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that, at that time in 2011, Rick Perrys's leadership was delivered to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom even won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsiders such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's persistence and begin to push their dollar down to topple him.
Here are some current poll numbers indicating that the Real Estate Mogul is not only a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity ratings have rotated by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid June, a poll of Monmouth-University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the Real Estate Mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Around three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60% of Republicans have a good view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a poll by CNN / ORC last week, 67% of the Republicans said that they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say that they are "angry" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43% say that they would "enthuse" about 40 percent that say the same about Trump.
The next in matters of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they are "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not regard Trump temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52% of Irish voters turn the Irish electorate into believing that the real estate Mogul is the right temperament for a president, so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is in the first preelection state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52% of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44% think that he did not have the personality to be effective, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament will not fit into the White House, such as ABC / Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When they set up their wrangling, Republican voters hold Trump for real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a poll by CNN / ORC last week four of ten that Trump is the best bet.
This is a switch from the moment when four out of ten at the end of July put their money to Yeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters had not had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
Yet it is evident that a large number of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign to be plausible.
Even if Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump almost beats everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll by the Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump has gained majority support.
He was ahead of Carly Fiorina 13 points, ahead of Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Yeb Bush 19 points, and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-on-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-on-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have formed their minds.
A new poll by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the electorate supporting Trump say that they have won their votes.
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say that you can never change the opinion.
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Yet Trump's strongest competition is at the moment the other outsider, the Neurochirurg Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their minds, are twice as much for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his campaign frees two months ago from Mexico's "rapists," immigration was central in the public discourse of 2016.
Some are worried that the bombastic expression of Trump from Trump is going to be remote from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But, after the new ABC / Post poll of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on issues of immigration.
So, as long as immigration remains in the limelight, Donald Trump will seem to be doing so.
Frustration with the government is spreading to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support of Republican voters, especially by their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll by ABC / Post, they want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa Republicans over the Republicans in the Congress are frustrated, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent angry. "
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in Hobookenweg you will find the most expensive condominium, with a view of the North Sea watt.
In the street, one square meter of a real estate house costs 73,300 Euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is of course limited," says it in the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows, in which special locations a square meter is the most expensive.
Of course, 18.70 Euro per square meter for a student bude in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top residential hotels, the price is like peanuts.
The real estate agency Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German locations - with square meters at a staggering height.
There are several tens of thousands of euros per square meter, of course.
But good who can afford to be...
By the way: For once, Munich is not at the top of the list.
Champions League: Bavaria-Dream start thanks to Müller and Götze.
Two-legged goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bavaria-Star Thomas Müller simply ran a race.
A happy hit from Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to a 3: 0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran 's.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
The world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in Piraeus.
The team of coaches Pep Guardiola won their play game in the Champions League in the Greek record master Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double-pack (52nd / 90th / 90th + 2) and Götzes (89th) earned with 3: 0 (0: 0).
The twelfth start of the race in Serie A is the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola is finally going to get the Henkelpott in Munich at last.
With his 28 hits in the Champions League in the Champions League, he received enthusiastic support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who left the world championship as a flanking shot.
"We will not underestimate them," Bavaria-Captain Philipp Lahm promised before the match in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich held the word.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without blurring.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the premier class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1: 3) was founded.
But the Bavaria, in seven Europacup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They played courageously, but their offensive efforts are often too unimaginative.
The attacks have been too often caused by the change of movement on the left, Douglas Costa, who has seldom gone through against the former rehabilitation of Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck on the right, when his flank came out of the right half-field in the upper left corner of the gate.
In the 67th minute the world champion promised the possible 2-0.
The best opportunities in half were Robert Lewandowski.
First, as Olympiakos-Stürmer Ideye Brown, the head ball of the Poles beat the line (26).
Then in direct order, the goalkeeper Roberto with the knee (35).
Although the Bavaria raised its usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to make needle-stick.
At the end of World War II, however, he was arrested and sentenced to death.
For example, when he took a shot of Ideye over the Latte (56th).
Before New, Guardiola set a four-seater chain with David Alaba in the center alongside Jerome Boateng, who made it good.
Mario Götze, after musculent problems returned to the Kader, was initially sitting out.
The World Cup hero took the green light only after the final exam, said sports officer Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Who wants to make something different is already malicious."
Even at the first change, Guardiola chose against him when he brought Kingsley Coman to the battered Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it clear 13 minutes later, by Elfmeter left.
Before the match, there was a strike in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially surrounded Bayern fans appeared in their spectator-block, the followers of the host had been provoked by the host of Piraeus with words and gestures, attacked the security forces and went with pundits against the Munich supporters.
At least a Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth.
For those who smoke, it damages not only the lungs, but also the teeth - which is close to a Potsdamer-long study.
The good news: If you don't waste, the risk is fast.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute of Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In contrast to non-smokers, smokers have the risk of getting rid of their teeth prematurely, by 2.5- to 3.6 times.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes of dental failure are caries and inflammation of the gum, emphasizes the DIfE.
For these parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, emphasize the authors.
Therefore, the connection between smoking and tooth loss is caused by more frequent gum infections in smokers.
It is not clear whether smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking would be able to reduce their risk in a short period of time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research."
However, it could take more than ten years before the danger to the standard of non-smokers, explained Erstautor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
People need to be persuaded to become non-smokers, the chief executive of Heiner Boeing from the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Not smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, leads to good dental health to high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population of 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Earlier investigations have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists have gathered in Cologne's Rhine bank on remnants of Late Antiquity.
For the umpteenth time, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called town monuments.
In all building projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always taken care of as a specialist for archaeological site maintenance.
In the third building section of the Rhine Triangle, archaeologists have now found what they are looking for.
From text documents it was already known that in the 4th century there was a fortress and a church in the 8th century, explained Trier.
In addition to the ruins of the fortress and the church tower, there was also a cemetery with around 350 grasses, which probably belonged to the church.
Young women in freight trains
The Federal Police is asking for help from a young woman at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern.
At the end of the train station, in the early afternoon morning at the end of the train station, the woman crossed the track and was captured by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
Through the acquisition of the train, the Federal Police carried out the most serious injuries.
She was hospitalized on the ground and brought to a hospital by rescue services.
On the grounds of the young woman's nocturnal track, the officials are not aware of the findings.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
The hotel is located in the heart of the city, close to the railway station, the railway station, the railway station and the railway station.
Notes that provide information about the cause of the accident can be provided by the Federal Police at telephone 0800 / 6888000 or any other police station, 24 hours a day and a free hotline of the Federal Police.
EU Commission is proposing a new court in dispute over TTIP.
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement, TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between groups and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that is in line with more traditional courts in its operation.
"We want to establish a system that the citizens trust," explains the relevant EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swedish Presidency has proposed that the proposal should be presented as a European negotiating position in the free trade negotiations with the United States.
The German government announced support.
Through TTIP, the world's largest free trade area will be created with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration procedure show in concrete terms that the EU States and the United States together elect independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come from the EU, the United States and third countries.
This is for the first time also a second instance.
It would allow us to object to judgments.
So far, the procedural partners have agreed on referees, an appeal against their judgments did not exist.
In the discussion of recent months, it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice.
In the long term, they want to work according to their own data on an International Investment Court.
There, then, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could then be clarified.
The investor-state arbitration (ISDS), primarily demanded by large corporations, is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitral courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can advance compensation at the expense of the taxpayers, undermine national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first statements, anti-TTIP organizations like Campact do not consider the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
Criticism has been levelled at the fact that it is not intended to apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
The German Minister of Economic Affairs, Matthias Machnig (SPD), has, on the other hand, described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission took account of key points in the reform which the Federal Minister for Trade, Sigmar Gabriel, drafted with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is on the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European company of BusinessEurope warned that too many new rules were to be imposed on the economic possibilities of the economy.
Small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, could be disadvantaged by this.
When the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) are to be concluded, it remains unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been going on since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the agreement was supposed to be at the end of this year.
This deadline is no longer tenable.
Lively Folk Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg, Germany.
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens is sitting on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
In addition to him, a flipchart, to which the shy folk singer, has been recording the picturesque US State of Michigan with a pencil drawing.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens's lecture.
He tells stories about the different places he always draws on the map, which they report on his discreet and delicate arranged songs.
Where they were born and what it looks like in their homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderful creative Irrer.
With the 2003 release and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," composed songs, which are very close to American folk in the late sixties, may seem to be able to drift away at any time.
There is a rumour that "Michigan" would be the first part of a worn-out series: Each of the 50 US states should follow suit.
But already in 2004 and in the Rhine near is already "Seven Swans" and breaks positive expectations.
It is now possible to come up here.
Live meet him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), 2005 is a truly celebrated masterpiece.
At the end of the day, there is no shortage of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album grew into the American Billboard charts and is missing in any annual list of influential music media.
After a very productive experiment, Stevens also serves on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth studio album is still widely orchestrated, but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and reverberations.
Even though the smaller clubs have increased, the stage shows are presented here to the colorful spectacle of neon teammates and high fluorescent stage desia.
At the moment it is a part of a five-person band from Germany.
In the dark hamburger more!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" since March.
Although nearly 2000 guests are currently sitting in their chairs, the Stevens, who became much more enthusiastic, returned to intimacy and to the folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians is playing through the richly enriched album.
Listen to the audience: The talk is "opulent" and thus you can throw away the "hard disk."
At the end of the day, you will be able to listen to a few older songs.
Jeremy Corbyns debut at Question Time to the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyns's debut in the Prime Minister's Question Time is eagerly awaited.
The New Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is being asked to make his debut in Question Time to the Prime Minister and to start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to address the first of his six set questions soon after noon, and his performance is likely to be reviewed by the media and by the Labour MEPs.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary audit for Mr Corbyns's leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the Tuc annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour Chairman's decision to remain in silence on Tuesday during the passage of the national anthem at a commemorative ceremony for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory-Presidents and is at the center of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbynn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
A spokesman by Mr Corbyn said that he had "in respectful silence" and he acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air strikes of England."
But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme, he told the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem "independent" from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns's top team, and they refer to divisions in the economy, defense and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC, Robin Brant, says that political divisions are stalling within Labour, according to Mr Corbyns's comments on the European Union's position on the European Union, and on the reduction in profits.
MR Corbyn said the Tuc conference that Labour changes the idea to remove the whole idea of a limit as a whole.
A few days later, Mr Smith, the shadow-working and pension minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to cut from $26,000 to £23,000.
It will be the fifth Labour Chairman, David Cameron, since he is Tory leader, facing the Dispatch box in Parliament over the last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who promised a different policy approach, says that he had "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 ideas.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is to be confrontational, and that it should refrain from "dexterity" and the strings, instead of focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow Minister of Economic Affairs, is represented when he does not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also raised the idea that other colleagues take the floor occasionally, and that he addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a "father's theatre," which is often linked to the Prime Minister's question, but a few years later he admitted that he failed to do so.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of the verdict of a leader and his leader in the House of Commons, and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she has become a caricature and requires far-reaching reforms.
'shooting in Joburg ': Homeless young people are trained for photographers.
The city centre of Johannesburg is a harsh place, if you are left homeless.

Pound increases by accelerating wage growth in the UK
The pound was soaring in line with data showing an increase in wage growth in the UK, and in parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABY project.
Between May and July, the result was 2.9% compared with the same period last year in the UK.
This percentage was the fastest, since 2009, at the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up to 0.84% from the euro to 1.3730 €.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
Mr President, Mr Miller was one of the outstanding shares on the market and made a jump of 20%, after the takeover bid of the rival AB Independents.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry stocks were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competition from the competition group for luxury goods.
Richemonts's latest sales figures beat all expectations, and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting growth again.
Shares of Glencore increased by 5% after the Bergbauriese said that it took USD 2.5 billion from stock-sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group of Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a fall of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had set his estimation for the company rating to "sell."
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports wear company had reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the six-month period.
The leader of JD Sports says that higher wages endanger the expansion.
JD Sports Peter Cowgill's Managing Director says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that these purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs of his firm, he says.
The costs could be in the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: At the Bieber Expedition in Berlin.
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Smiling 21 years old, a hanging with a top end.
The type with the platinblon hair is 100 million euros hard.
More or less.
At the moment is Monsieur Bieber in Berlin.
And the generation U17 turns out.
How Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name of the Ritz Carlton.
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans attended yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, the polder is seated on the cold stone plates of the Berlin-based luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The bending over construction: Here you live your idol, whose posters hang on in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs the day exactly as much as their mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If anything.
The saying goes: "Actually, my Wiktoria had to sit in the tenth class in the high school."
"I realize it a dream."
Compulsory education?
Who is itching?
The fans do not.
Even thrusters themselves do not.
That was out of the question anyway.
For the advertising in the promotional break of the super-cup he received three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company flush many, many dollars in the bending over.
And at every doll, which looks like him and over the ladders, the bending also wins.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you are amazed by the window window.
He has been able to exploit more than 100 million in such a way.
Some say that the hype is going too far.
In the USA and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?" In the USA and the United Kingdom, "What do you mean?" In the first place.
Even if the fourth album in November is to be followed, the many zeros are not interested.
At least, he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanon to potato döner idea
Potatoes or Döner?
It is both - and this is what is happening in the potato döner, which the Oldenburger snack-maker Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the slogan "potato instead of döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay potatoes and meat put together on a table.
On the idea he brought him a poster with the inscription "potatoes instead of Döner," which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, in his shop, there has been a barbecue that is equipped with meat and potatoes.
"That is Multikulti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been recorded by the Lebanese Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a commodity model.
As much meat, however, and how much potatoes the tables contain, it does not want to betray it.
Just as much: "It tastes together even better," he finds.
At its customers, too, culinary international understanding is a good thing.
Metcash is launching a campaign to combat Aldi-
Metcash tries to protect the IGA stores in front of an Aldi rally in South Australia and Western Australia.
Commodity wholesalers Metcash launched a campaign campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million stake.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media, as well as events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like Eismanufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough who distributes in IGA stores samples and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholesale trader for food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investment strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, since South Australia and Western Australia represent almost 30 percent of metcashs IGA stores and generate higher profit margins as a Metcashs IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia, compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
But analysts, like Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will pick up around five per cent of the food market in these two countries 12 months after the opening of its first markets, and will take away all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose 360 $million per year, and Metcash to lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and achieve a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in every market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Metcashs's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash some $13 million profit before interest and taxes, said by Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcarte loses market share in the eastern states, mainly on Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashs's sales in food and food business will decline by 3.8% in 2016, by 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and will reduce the market share of 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, was told in a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade or more.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Douglass.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash was contacted by Mr Douglass last week.
Since 2010, GAS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14%, and revenues from Metcashs's food and food trade, which supplies around 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational deleveraging at the same time as printing on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is standing up and investing more than $150 million to improve sales prices in Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores in the improvement of their stores through fast-growing fresh food, and to provide a better range of private label food products.
Metcashs's chief executive, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and loading rehabilitation programs will rise and hopes that, for the first time in four years, the wholesaler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis Federation Steve Healy.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for its behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Morris and, according to the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve Healy, deserves praise as a criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is often referred to as "Special Ks," came to the fore with the infamous controversy of Kyrgyzstan with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent had to be separated by the referee twice by the referee, with Harrison saying: "Wawrinka would have had to strike together, and I should beat the child."
While he was finally seen how he smashed a tennis racquet, after a crack of a potential US open victory was defeated by Richard Gasquet, the Kokkinakis of Healy was steadfastly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing against Sam Groth in competition with Sam Groth in the solo after Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup semi-final against the United Kingdom.
"One thing about which I am pretty much more involved is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi has been dragged into the quarrel," said Healy.
He broke a racquet when he lost a gun in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player to have broken a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think that he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I believe he has been treated somewhat too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he has never had a problem with the other players, he has never been a problem with the other players, he has never been a problem with the other players, he has never been a problem with the other players, he has never been a problem with the other players, he has never been a problem with the other players, he has never been a problem with the other players, he has never been a problem with the other players, he has never been a problem with the other players, he has never been a problem with the other players, he has never been a problem with the other players, he has never been a problem with the other players, he has never had a problem with the other players, he has never had a problem with the other players, he has never had a problem with the other
Healy also supported the decision to not take into account Kyrgyzstan's important pre-decision, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for all, but it ensures the man of Canberra as a long-term permanent component in the team. "
"First we want the team to be focused entirely on competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgyzstan]," said Healy.
I think that Nick quickly made the climb, which people like Federer and Murray pointed out, and he's rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he is best for the team, and it is best for the team and it is the best for the team and it is the best for the team and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declared a state of emergency, closing the border, holding refugees back.
Hungary declared its emergency and concluded the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border, when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence were hiding for an unknown time in a strip of land between the two countries' control points and built tents and settled down there.
But frustrations rose.
As a police helicopter above them, the migrants entered the border "open the border!" And shouted insults against the Hungarian standby police.
Some argued in protest food and water back.
Serbia's foreign minister declared that it was' unacceptable 'to send migrants from Hungary, while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border was unable to agree a common immigration policy one day after the 28-nation bloc in a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people, who were taking refuge in Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would receive another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not have hope for an early action from Brussels or from its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions, which was called on Tuesday, gave greater powers to the authorities to cope with the crisis, so that they could close down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire along its border with Romania, to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after a fence ended on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison guards were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, and has become the gateway to the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the coming economic migrants who are in search of a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the shameful of the 4-metre (13 foot) high fence, which the government built along the southern border with Serbia, on a crime, and these laws impose higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian Government explains the state of emergency" said government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say very clearly that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament must, in procedural terms, still agree to the use of the military, which is expected next week, but reporters of Associated Press have already seen the border of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Adviser for Orban, has said that the authorities have experienced 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others have already had deeper into the country.
They come up by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes according to the new laws.
The authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also signed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train train with barbed wire to close the borders had arrived.
Chaos surrounds the most important border crossing point near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and put a mass of people pressed to get there.
Some 20 managed to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's margin over Bernie Sanders in the national survey has halved.
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her opposite ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47% of democratic voters in the pre-election (58% before), while Sanders is second, with 27% (increase by 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency, receives support from 15% of the presidential election's democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their position is defined which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news poll, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has won some prizes.
Clinton keeps a big lead in women and moderates, but the leaps have been reduced.
Their support for men has fallen sharply, and Sanders is only back on 5 points.
Clinton's advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and they and Sanders are now equal.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage over the elderly.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with two-digit ahead of the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage in this group.
About half of the national election's democratic voters say that they would support them with enthusiasm Clinton if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15% would only support it, because it is the candidate.
Six per cent would not support them.
Not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it.
The views are more mixed with those who do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusiastically.
While 48% of the Democratic voters of the previous elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this through their leading candidate, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's supporters are asked for an open question, why they want it to be the candidate, is the most common response that it has the right experience (16%), followed by the view that it is time for a woman president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned their ties to Bill Clinton (9%).
Support for dealing with the problems and eligibility are also cited.
As the Vice-President throws up the presidency's potential for the presidency, 57% of the presidential election's democratic voters want to see him in the race, although a third believe that he should not.
If democratic voters of the preliminary elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
From Clinton's supporters, more than half are saying that Biden's second choice is far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to stand for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton increases the lead from Sanders, 20 points with biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning, but that figure fell 78% last month.
Biden is by far the second in this measurement, but the percentage that regards him as the "most entitled" is up.
However, when it comes to the question of what is more important to a candidate, the electorate asks questions about eligibility.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these voters of the pre-election.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results on some important characteristics with voters in their party's preliminary elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, trustworthy, and endowed with strong leadership.
Biden scores best with the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not agree with him.
Democratic voters of the elections generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic electorate has no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during the term of office as Secretary of State remain, most Democratic voters are content with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions as a whole.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with their statement, while only about one third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on Clinton's general opinions, even though 36% said that their opinion had worsened.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton's views have become worse.
Although Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this remains a problem for them with registered voters: Only 32% are honest and trustworthy, eight per cent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of voters do not consider it to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of the electorate's electioneers consider Trump to be dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good marks at leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson, and Bush are best placed to be honest.
The majority views Sanders as honest, but like Carson, many do not have the opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson turns into a nationwide survey close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson is in the latest poll of CBS News / New York Times close to Donald Trump
The two candidates now account for half of the voters' support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers, with the support of 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month, at 27% in the Tuesday's poll.
But Carson shot in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also revealed that Carson is well received by demographic groups, earning Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has fallen down with Wisconges Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen at the deepest level, with 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Governor Yeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, is at 6% on the third place.
The margin of error on the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey, which was published last week, shows that Carson is increasing in the polls - with 19% support for Republicans, behind Trump, with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump well before Carson.
With regard to a Carson rising in the past week, Trump found some site engravings for the former neurothesia, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's belief.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is now up to 29 degrees warm.
Even though peak values can only be measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing tourists to find warm water.
A bath in the North or the Baltic Sea should be a short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees.
It is no longer possible to go into the sea: A maximum of 18 degrees, the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week, shares the German Weather Service (DWD).
Bath temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: In the east, there are even up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic, it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood were charged with the death of a baruch college newcomer.
Almost two years after a student, a student with a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, passed away, murder charges were filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Deng during an introduction in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, divided the police.
Officials said that he was burdened with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng then complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi brothers did not call the emergency number 911, after Deng impotent and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital, so the police.
However, they had the time to change Dengs clothing, to contact their symptoms of goocs and Andy Meng, to contact the national presidents of the Brotherhood to seek advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide Utensilien and presented the welfare of the brotherhood basically on that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
Prior to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly dealt with sharp injuries to head, trunk, and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by harassment of the Brotherhood, and at least one student dies every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents the Dengian family.
Parliaments and their members must be held to account, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment of Morder's third grade for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also indicted for oppressive attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We do not only want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organisation which, officially or unofficial, has sanctioned this, so we will also hold them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national Brotherhood has withdrawn membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
An interest-rate hike is coming, and domestic terrorism will falter, returns on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months after the initial increase in interest rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in responding to the economy and financial assets.
That is why US Central Bank officials have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus when they begin to raise interest rates, but rather to the period that is needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end of the day, however, market participants can say that all the excitement may have been exaggerated because of a rate hike.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still to low levels to lead to seismic shock, which many people seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here, a historical trend is based on how some sectors of the economy could respond:
As the market saw last month, the advance of interest-rate hikes may be volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens to the Fed's interest-rate increases.
More specifically, the market has, in the last 35 years, mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to raise interest rates, fairly flat in the 250 days (average profit of 2.6%), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the last six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis, published by Bob Doll, chief plant stratege at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's in Barron.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to appear later in the wake-up cycle and that the return on it begins to reduce.
Recessions are a reality of economic life, but they often promote interest-rate hikes.
In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that it did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
What is remarkable is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the Fed's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal GDP of 118 interest-rate hikes since 1950 only twice had the nominal GDP below 4.5%.
While the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect this to continue, and expect only 1.5% for the third quarter of the Atlanta Fed.
Interest-rate hikes in such a fragile economic landscape could be risky and raise the question of whether this time is different, "said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken the Fed to raise interest rates all year round, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading accounts for only 25%.
"In our study, all the life cycles of the 1950" s have taken place in a super cycle, with a growing momentum in GDP, and pre-recession very soon after the beginning of recovery, "says the report.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the phase observed.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this has been 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipated an interest-rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than in equities, if they change their strategic course.
On bonds, the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle takes place.
At the end of the rise cycle, bond yields are immediately falling, the Deutsche Bank said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will mean that returns between longer and shorter bonds are closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still wary of expecting higher returns," said Kathy Jones, Fixed Income analyst in Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, says Jones, that markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy" wrote it.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the earnings curve is flatter, lending has expanded, and volatility has increased - all the features of the market if the Fed tightens its strategy.
In general, businesses that manage the larger part of their operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debt.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to respond very positively, three months after an initial rise in interest rates," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have surpassed companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest-rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004 average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as low volatility in their shares, also exceed their counterparts with low quality on average per 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Businesses with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside pure equity games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher returns, even if experts are of different views about how quickly that will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MEP Andrew Bingham.
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the channel for his "ducking"
He argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitate The Brits.
Parliament's fellow Member, Mr Damien Collins, took over the broadcasting of The Voice and said that it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "converts to Classic FM," claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that it is doing something that the private sender does not do.
The Conservative Member, Andrew Bingham, also mentioned the BBC Bossen that the public radio station "stupid" and increasingly no longer can be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 - I don't like to use the word" stupid "- but it seems to turn to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be The Brits only under a different name.
So if you try to do something else - these are two cases spontaneously mentioned, in which you actually only imitate what is already on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director-General dismissed the charges and argued that BBC Radio 3 was flying well before his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learned from Radio 3 that I will never learn anything about classical music anywhere.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works, I think really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work needs to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British were less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production that, during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport, fell under fire, to put commercial rivals on their feet.
The Tory MP Damien Collins intervened - the musical talent show of the BBC, bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of $22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed, because it is not original and not particularly marked?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 Show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way.
He added that he would like the company to "take a hit from our in-house stable" when the next time he starts a series of entertainment.
However, he refused to rule out the ordering of other ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased in August the slowest and Black Friday can be responsible for this.
In the first three months of 2015, there have been seven per cent increase in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since the records began in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slowed down expenditure.
For over a decade, virtual shopping has bent, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnant after new numbers showed only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the records began in 2000, with only 5% increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales stagnate, after new figures showed only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, it has always been evolving over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago, when buyers began to make purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do it in different environments, for example home on the sofa.
But this is now commending, and we may find that growth is decreasing.
The Black-Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is quoted as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, five times the average number of buyers about their computers to make their bargains, and some retailer sites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers were fighting for bargains, might discourage purchasers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that there was a little more than £1.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims are buried in Mecca at the Kran accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca by the streets.
Saudi Arabia exposes the collapse in part of the huge Saudic Bin Laden group to the burden.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered together as 29 of the victims were borne by the streets in order to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed into Mekka's Grand Moschee.
Grieved, largely dressed in white, the track to pay their respects when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moignal cemetery.
The grape harvest was passed on to the Holy Site, where only days earlier, a building crater fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the begging.
The corpses were released for funeral, when the Saudi king was imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Moschee Mekka were borne by the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, the father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage trip when the crane was supporting the crane.
Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the year.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Taliban will continue for Mecca with thousands of people who will continue to come to town.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin Laden Group should not let the crane's arm stop when he was not used.
An Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman vowed to unveil what caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the Greater Moschee, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the Haddsch who took place later this month were gathering together.
The Bin Laden Group did not produce statements about the collapse of cranes, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also rebuked the group for not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mekkas Großmoschee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-loading group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son from the family in the 1990's.
The crash of the crane occurred amid strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is at least necessary in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials admitted that 1 million Rial (£174,000) were to be paid to the relatives of the displaced persons and the same amount was permanently injured.
Other people are receiving half of this amount.
B & Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over.
British people increasingly employ tradesmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has outpaced growth.
This means that 200 more screwfix stores that aim at craftsmen will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide.
From Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British are laying down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes.
If you are able to handle a hammer or a brush to remove walls, you seem to be a minority nowadays.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry home jobs in their homes, so the boss of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, a new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the building market chain, said that a huge increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, who offer services at low prices, is now obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more screwfix shops, which are to be turned to craftsmen and 60 retail outlets of B & Q.
Mrs Laury said that she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the shop were made by women.
At present, men are outweighed by men.
She said that it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that do more than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: 'There is still a majority of men in our stores.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the head of a UK in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team in order to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial director.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious choice - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year earnings and the move after the group taught the costs of closing the shops.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new stores.
Civil servants of Aich / Dob because of infidelity to court
On Wednesday, at the Regional Court of Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-president Aich / Dob will have to answer because of infidelity and fault-making.
The defendants were not guilty of this.
One of them was also accused of abuse of power.
He was legally acquitted in May on this accusation.
The current process has been postponed.
According to the Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, the pre-examination showed that the defendants were used for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011, and were used for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
He calculated the damage with about 400,000 euros.
The sport officials are also indicted for financial offences.
The chairman of the Schopenensenats, Judge Michaela Sanin, left this fact.
It is to be negotiated at a later stage.
To the death of the Unfaithful, the defense was that the association was not created at any point in time.
The sporting functionaries would only have offset the expenses of expenses and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011, and in which they had invested a lot of time and money in which they had spent a great deal of time and money, in which they had been running out of debt - the passva in the year 2001 was about 600,000 schillings (approximately 44.000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: Would we continue or stop the club," said one of the accused, in the bread occupation of the financial office.
With his colleague and co-accused he decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We poured money into our life assurance programs as security at the bank," he said.
The association was agreed: You can freely manage the money, no debt can be done.
In addition, in the event of an adequate financial success, the payment of expenses compensation has been decided retroactively until 1991.
That is why, only years later, in 2003, as a plus on the account, a portion of allowances was paid out.
As a result, however, the former Obmann seemed to be looking at package and non-detail, as was the case.
The accounts and savings books administered the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
If the payouts had not been disclosed to the club, the judge asked.
The association did not interest in the detail of financial management, so it was important to have only debt freedom, so the answer.
An amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the club's account in 2011, against which a functional investigation was started.
These were returned, the accused declared.
This securities account was on the name of the second accused and was not known, according to the club.
"Why?" Wanted to know the judge.
That was not the answer for a long time.
He finally thought he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If it had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor went to the room.
The co-accused was informed, justified by the law.
This transfer has been formulated as a "Damage Contribution."
As regards damage-ment, the judge and the public prosecutor wanted to know.
The first accused, the first person, said that he did not agree with this wording, because the club had never been damaged.
But what to do when the lawyer says: "With you are all out of the Schneider."
"Am I a legal representative?" He asked.
At the same time, he said that he had never paid a cent salary, he only used to charge kilometers and diets.
At diets he charged the club 1,000 euros a month, but the actual cost was much higher, he added.
Exact documents for the early years were not available to the accused.
These were no longer preserved after a test of operations, in which everything was deemed to have been properly assessed.
Km, the second accused was also referred to.
He said in his statement that all the rest of the world had to be done in cash, in which he had to go from his home to the bank to come to the bank of the Bank.
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard has enough more 30,000 jobs
In addition to the workforce reduction that has been taking place for three years now, the computer giant will lose more jobs in the division of the company.
The job offers in the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not stop.
The US technology group, within the framework of its restructuring, is planning to phase out between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in its business customers.
This will save costs amounting to EUR 2.7 billion (2.4 billion euros), divided the company on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special burden of around €2.7 billion, which will result from the fourth quarter.
The dismantling of 55,000 jobs over three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of fiscal 2013 / 14, HP employed around 302,000 employees.
On the other hand, the Hewlett-Packard stock had a 2.3% share.
At the moment, with printers, the Group from California Palo Alto is moving on: This is how the computer and printer business will be bundled in a new company again this year - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both business areas are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A further disappointing PC paragraph and a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services set the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last.
In the third quarter to the end of July, the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to almost $25.4 billion.
As a result, revenues fell in 15 quarters of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and a massive set of jobs in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has just been late in responding to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans, on the whole, look at the mining of around 55,000 posts.
Conflicts: Majority support the anti-IS education mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in the war in Iraq would, however, be overwhelmingly opposed: 54% opposed it, 35% were in favor.
The fact that other states fly air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61% positive.
24% are opposed to intervention in the conflict.
Cooperation with the Syrian leader, Baschar al-Assad, would reject 51% of respondents, 20% would be in favour.
29 per cent could not decide.
Car: The second day of the press on the 66th IAA.
At the centre of the fair there are networked, self-driving cars as well as electromobility until 27 September.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility" and officially open on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the Auto-Verband VDA calculate the same as two years ago with about 900 000 visitors.
Röszke: Violence of violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police used the Serbian border with Röszke Tränengas and water spotters against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind him there was a police line formed and behind the police there was a water cannon.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials.
First of all, the civil servants set up pepper spray.
Then the police used tear gas.
Much Tränengas was devoured in the direction of the refugees.
That meant that the group was dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little.
A pregnant woman and apparently injured woman was worn out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the Tränengah shouted.
Other refugees blew together and suffered from breathing.
Also the press officer of the Serbian police suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve meets two days on Wednesday and Thursday to take the important decision whether, for the first time in almost a decade, interest rates have been raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half that the Fed thought was that the Fed would do so now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and that interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25%.
It is a historical event because it has been seven years since the Fed pushed interest rates on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero-range and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Managing Director of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively high level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet, generating only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook in terms of global relations.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday.
Death Protect at Delta State University left debt forgiveness
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later climbed and killed his colleague later on day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was "sorry" for the first murder and wanted "he could do it unwell," the government announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number against 10: 00 on Monday morning.
And said that he had shot on someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I stumble my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" in the house is in the house, but that "no one will disturb" but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller on his behalf, but he did not give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police hit the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a hand-written note of Lamb, 45, who said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman I ever loved. "
Following the letter of the note, Lamb took 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as a policeman surrounded him.
University's president, William LaForge, said that he knew nothing about a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, said authorities on Tuesday, said "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they had been married about seven years ago as a "good man."
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O 'Steen said, he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and it was "destroyed on the ground."
He said that Prentiss was their daughter "Best Best Friends."
Prentiss worked online at home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had met with Lamb for about three years.
"You wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a particular point on Monday to tell them "he goes nowhere."
When police attacked him on the Highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled to foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral degree from Delta State University from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 on how his life's life in the university's web site.
Stars that have lost their fortune-makers
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor has reportedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug ownership.
All of this certainly takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is building the Group around the world.
The Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring.
A half billion euros a year does not want to save the Lufthansa Group with a better organization.
150 of the world's approximately 1000 managers will cost the company restructuring the job.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union trade union.
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evaluates the low-cost Eurowings.
The goal of rebalancing is to generate a result contribution of around €500 million a year from cost and trust synergies, divided the airline on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will not have a board for the passenger business in the future.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In future Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Executive Board Team with CEO Carsten Spohr.
With the new creation, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, which will continue to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
Until now, the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been complex.
The airlines were operating under the umbrella of the airline group, which represents the three-quarters of the annual turnover of €30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the event of a dispute with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations will be resumed after the court-led strike this Thursday.
That was what the trade union said.
The subject of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
In a year with a predicted record result, the "want to" want to "want to achieve positive results" in a year's time.
The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In comparison, apart from the transitional provision of the pilots, the savings concept is the austerity concept "Wings."
It provides that, in the fight against competitors, Lufthansa will be sold to the Group's own low-cost line Eurowings.
Under the title "Morgenzug in the South," paintings by Leena Krüger can be seen in the artist's house.
For a long time in the city of Göttingen, Finnish in the White House of the House has assembled a selection of titles that their viewers animate in order to go on a journey.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months on double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracturing of his right-balance in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this was brought to the front of the left wing and will exclude him for at least six months from the game, Louis van Gaal does not hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The violation was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw in the PSV area had collapsed.
He took nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
It will be moved tomorrow, or maybe a day later, and then operated in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it is very heavy and then plays great, and that is what happens.
In the changing room, he had an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double questionnaire, then it takes six months, and it will not play in the group phase.
I hope that he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of an Elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexicans.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an Elfmeter and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaws's account was: "I thank you all for your messages.
In response to this, Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV.
The British defender, with the European Cup in France, has an additional incentive to recover from the coming June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It is a very serious injury."
When a player leaves the place with this type of injury, all are very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to violate an opponent.
Berlusconi suffered a war when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"It is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it is a very serious injury, this is not good," said Cocu.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that went in a different direction, so it looked as if he had touched him [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how to feel it, I know how difficult it can be.
I am very sorry, I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a Foulgame of Chris Smalling.
Sure, David Cameron knows better?
It is a thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take a long time until you know it almost.
Unless you are, perhaps, David Cameron.
When he was asked by a child care provider to call his favorite child book, the Prime Minister decided for the Lorax, the environmental fabel of Dr Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the site of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I love to read out to my children, because it seems that there is always a picture or a message that we have already missed."
All beautiful and good, except that the subsequent paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the act of the book, instead represents a summary of the 2012 movie that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to gain the heart of Audrey, to win the girl of his dreams, by going to see her desire to see a real tree," a love interest was Dr Seuss, whose name Theodor Seuss was hostage and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if it were not yet suspicious enough: The Cameron-made text reads in part like the summing up of the Lorax film that is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams," the heart of Audrey, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the heart of Audrey, the heart of Audrey.
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron will be so little familiar with the plot of the book, in which an unnamed boy, like the local environment, will be devastated by the name-maker Lorax, a hockling, melodious creature that speaks on the name of the trees, a hock-ending, melodious creature that speaks in the name of the trees.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR job was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokesman said that the text probably came from Cameron's electoral district office.
SuperCamp confirmed that the text of Cameron's staff was delivered, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it is still hard to do so.
Standing in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the Kader, who has chosen England for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my card.
I would not rule out victory.
Alastair Cooks page is probably less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin-players in the Batting setting, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars from 2012, only a july-positive attitude.
With the ball develops Moeen Ali as a spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related news: Adam Lyth leaves from the England test team and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult to analyze for me as his head teacher in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are targeted at outcomes.
There were no question marks for Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - as I said earlier - players are their own best selection.
A long time ago, the run of Lyth had been extended, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he hope for more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even though he did not perform such a good performance, and this does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton was given nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and play.
The only charge that could be raised was that England first became Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in the peak - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a drummer whom I highly appreciate.
He is an X-factor crickplayer, what we saw at Yorkshire earlier this season, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge square, which was very much to us.
He must receive at least the same opportunities as the one before him, but that, of course, depends on the team composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen cook, making a Extra Spin Bowler and received four spicks, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a drummer cannot beat there, and these left-wing countries have already shown that he is a ghost of cricket players.
Moeen may have not finished his job for his county Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
My former team mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he first appeared in 2001.
He made three hundred runs straight away and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the Kader as a back-up spider, and in my limited handling of him he has greatly impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - on average 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and think, it's a punt, but there are no great number of backup spins that collect their hands and the coaches have decided for young people.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England made a few clever additions to the trainee.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master-coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood stands for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and power to the setup.
I always felt that he was created for international cricket competition, as a player or a coach, and like Mahela has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes, new voices can breathe fresh air in the changing room, even if the news is in line with what has been said previously.
Collys team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break for Australia and I for my part have no problem with it.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team members do not set the timetable.
And you must remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
The Brexit warehouse (Brexit = exit of Britain from the EU) could gain access if the economy in 2017 in 2017.
David Cameron's bottomless renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to the Labour or Tuc Labour Party, which has been brutally crushed on Tuesday for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat has recently said that some member states are so deeply entangled in various crises, as the EU is now, and not always out of their own fault, Britain's own agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which most of them do not want.
In Brighton, the Tuc decided, at its annual meeting, that it does not even endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a photo of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, come home and say that they win allies for reform.
It is always about me.
My European friend, who would like to see Britain in the interior of the EU-tent outside, says "Lass us not alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capital cities to the point that they do not care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautious leader Angela Merkel is a ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as it did for the overlong, like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14), and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or its replacement in 2017.
It is also a hollow force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain left a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will pull out of a leg to help the Selfie British, whose energy should be better used to escape from the UK's exit from the UK - something they do not want because most of the similar separatist tendencies are in place.
As a result, some of these ministers probably do not want to consider unhelpful comments, in the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process suspects my friend.
"The renegotiation was a default" and "the United Kingdom has gained nothing from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense, and which EU skeptics will be the oligarchy of the Pressebarone, as it did during Tony Benn's inspired referendum in 1975, which did not support our admission in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
They can be weak to Boris Johnson, the Erz-euro opportunists, who made a name rather than an "EU-Gerade-bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.
With all his deceit, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of fiscal villains, telephone hams and the pseudo-non-native who have the majority of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but found that, when you sit in a cage with a hot Gorilla, you are distributing better bananas in order to divert him away, rather than to become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself, when he resisted Cameron's referendum, because Blair had the principle of the unadopted constitution of the EU, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thereby opening it to a back door.
The press has never pulled him out of it.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who gave me a friendly soft drink on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he doesn't have time to waste more for me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnocks boycotts Murdoch's strategy of the 80-year-old, a mistake then and today.
It may take, but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC-sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns official position on Europe is - I speak it friendly - in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukips traditional Blaufarbstoff trend, and the wild nature of Torys's Klein-Englanism, everyone can say "yes" to everyone.
It is what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on radio and television this week, when the Scouts fought him, not to admit that Corbyns's nomination of the provocative John McDonnell was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70-he years, as his old father on television, to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilarys's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "in all circumstances" - Benns's phrase - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to his companions and members after all the reports at their final meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and, above all, in the Strudel of the Social Media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe, which allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins surely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns fundamental ambiguities of EU membership - in line with their Bennite knowledge economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a key principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguity about NATO - Tom Watson is keen that JC does not launch a campaign to exit JC - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try, in all, to find a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have a suspicious electorate - to make concessions to the British if this can be pointless?
The US is already rather disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, in Libya, and in Syria, even with a reduction in the Tory government's cost, and I was reminded of what was said by British influenza Security Forum at the start of Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England's report on e-cigarettes
Statements made by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was created out of a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "fundamental report" last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A temporary article in the medicinal journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy base" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims are "built on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
You said that the public expects the assertion of PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multiple decision-making analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to bring their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose directors were supposed to have received from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also wrote the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said to receive money from an e-cigarette producer, but not to add to the funding that he should have previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International in advance.
The reasons for selecting the members of the body will not be delivered, but it includes a number of well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which include a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
At the meeting, the tobacco management of PHE took part.
The group's research shows that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the allegations of PHE that "there has been no evidence to date that e-cigarettes are a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" was premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director for health and well-being at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ have already been answered before.
He said: 'E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking'.
Every second lifetime smoker dies in his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what constitutes evidence and what not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison with tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease of smoking, and smoking is costing the National Health System two billion euros a year.
By clearly setting out current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should give up Eastenders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like Eastenders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels.
He criticized the BBC for using public-sector programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, to place in tough time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had been trying to contact the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent, which would also be clearly shown by non-subsidised rivals," Johnson said the Oberhaus communication committee in the framework of its study of the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I think is not a good idea in the medium or long term, your production should at least be on programs that others do not or do not want to do.
They send The Voice in a prime time window, because they want to achieve as broad a support as possible for their future.
The idea that otherwise nobody would show it is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax is funded, which could also be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, Eastenders is another, admittedly both self-productions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm.
I am trying to see how this should be public service television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the hunt for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC give again what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how Eastenders should sell.
Johnson said that the rather public-legal niches should go to BBC4, where you can't measure the audience, but they perform their duties, and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion £radio fees, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody saw '.
They put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them.
On the radio charge, Johnson told the committee: 'I call on you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions, who can obtain the best value from it.
Of course, all of us think you all think that you will receive a lot of money for 150 pounds a year, but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 £, I wonder whether that is true, because they do not consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky- and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also said to the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian Mission, "inform, educate, and entertain."
He said little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should take a look at public service TV stations in Australia and Canada, for example, to inform, educate, and entertain ".
On the question of partnerships, Elstein, the BBC should do more in areas such as that of the Proms, of which he said that only a handful of television are shown, and with the commercial channels alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves.
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms from genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by leaks from sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction in the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses, which have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulse works by activating motor Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Further on this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, which can be used on ultrasound to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Squekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that one day the process could replace the brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Franate worms do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplified the ultrasound waves that then spread into the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves work on structures that are called TRP-4-ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the sperm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, such as the Nature Communications report.
In order to create ultrasound-guided nematodes, Chalasani modified genetically modified worms so that some of their Motoneurones wear TRP-4 ion channels.
If he uses ultrasound on the modified creatures, the sound waves will be amplified through the nipples and transmitted to the worms where they turn on the modified Motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a ground-breaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons with the impulse of light on and off.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light emitted by an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, low frequency ultrasonic waves can pass freely and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the prescribed human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The Paths of Britain's Arms Trade
Amnesty International Anti-Arms Exhibitions-Video watch.
Terrible murderers of the murderer!
We are looking forward to hearing from you!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock, which causes pain, but does not leave a trace!
The happy voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this display for the world's largest arms trade is a militant parody conducted by Amnesty International to put the British Government in the spotlight on the willingness of the British government to scrap weapons to repressive regimes over Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree in the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign leads also to many posters, which are to be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains, which require a second glance.
"Important announcement: Go from the 15th to the 18th of September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns to the image of a tank.
In September, a bale of arms dealers with the DLR will drive... customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of gruesome designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a 6 £-pack of InbusKeys, which claims that "access to around one-third of the bus advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London does not make fun of this placid "vandalism."
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and Lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists engage with activists within protest movements to work and say that they have to go out into the real world outside, so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms advertising posters greet the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty-Video has been seen more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, who works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that reigned around the advertising of the arms trade - through an exile of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign that they try to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising, but "in the eyes of bright colors and animation, it remains stronger."
"You have done a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment on the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is intervention by the British Government and a guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area inside ExCeL, where exhibitors are creating fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the US Army over "the AT4CS RS captured by the shoulder."
This includes a "unique shape of the warhead that delivers outstanding post-impact effects within the target."
Whatever that means, it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for life in student residences
Eleven years ago, I moved as a self-forgotten 19-year old in a student residence, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smile of those whom I annoyed - and to the many, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student residence ranges from easy temper to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to cheat: People tell about where you are coming, if and where you have taken the Sabbath season, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why, "honestly, Marmite neither love nor hate, because in the seriousness, guys, it's just a yeast extract hahaha, I'm in my room."
Breathe in.
And help others to do the same - find questions and show interest.
It distracts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk about, even if your teeth were in fire and these fire extinguishers would be.
Let people.
The rooms of people are often transformed into beverage receptions, film night sites and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people wear and wear their underwear.
Related to this: Do not think about starting with a relationship at the university.
Introspection received a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a hideaway, but many student residences are a space-to-space-strolling culture, which is friendly and socially minded and can lead to life-long friendship.
This can be the hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you must go away so that I get back the energy that I used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a commilitone is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of you, do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship ties in with baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the back-manie, the bat is on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate of brownies, less weird than the welcoming of the 1950-he years "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked you something, so, and now please smile if I put a few personal questions".
Making delicious treats is a good way to make friends.
Their fellow residents feel obliged to entertain themselves and may at the end associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly missed clumps of flour, sugar and fat result in people sleeping asleep when you knock.
Eating to steal is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, the claws of chicken are theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea?
Check that with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your belongings, this is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to treat them more evenly than my fellow-mates who added their milk to a dishwasher to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You should not make noise that prevents people from sleep or from work.
It is not just a matter of being a decent person, but that you literally belong to the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbours whether it was a little bit quieter, it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even more vocal music.
When, at the end of the day, they stopped at 5 o'clock, they were grateful to their neighbours to sleep for two hours before leaving their own music, their doors closed and passed to their three-hour review.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally join the same student residence?
On the other hand, it would not be abominable if you had a co-resident for your future spouses, to take care of them, to get rid of them and to see them every day, and perhaps see how they spread all the shared friends?
Of course, the heart goes his own way - but if a hot fellow-lover is definitely not your marriage partner in it, try, at least, to try for a bit of reason.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his key in his unbroken room, the boundary between an Ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good fortune is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes boomerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about security through hiding a valuable and amusing lesson - but don't hurt anyone's rooms with toothpaste and shampoo.
Shut your door, and put your key into a glass of water, which you then put into the freezer - but you do not attack your possessions on the ceiling any more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single-parent families, low-earners
The real estate manager Markus Gildner builds houses for people who do not have a lot of money in the Middle Franconian corner-valley.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also single mothers and low-earners."
"I show you how to build even more cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview.
Thousands of refugees are forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly favorable living space can be created: It is built in a project of terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees are forced into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass housing in containers or gyms does not have any sustainability.
For the people remain to a large part here.
In the face of the flood of refugees, we also need sufficient living space over the next few decades.
A completely banal, three-story terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs least of course.
It facilitates integration.
This is different from undercutting people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say that it is again peace, I go back.
Then the houses can be easily converted according to their needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square meters per house amounts to 184 000 euros, without land.
That is manageable.
Six months has taken the construction of the building.
That is appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I fixed my project correctly.
It is particularly complicated by the threatening sword of Damocles and the Stellland Regulation.
Grey.
It is still under consideration who creates three apartments in a terraced house requires at least three pitches.
It is only in the cities that there is a lack of space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents respond to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What is definitely not right.
But do you not aggravate competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True, in the last five years we have had a construction boom in Germany, but built luxury flats, which can hardly afford any more.
My project has the message, even ordinary people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also single mothers or low-earners.
I show how to build even more cheaply and well today.
That is what it is all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
Ios 9: How to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by typing in the configuration app, typing in "Generic" and then selecting "Software Update."
If it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation because they get an error message saying that the "Software update failed."
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait until the onslaught goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
This could possibly mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it less likely through the streamlining of the updates, and it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them when the process is completed.
It is worth to make sure that your mobile phone is recharged during the upgrade or is located close to a charger, so that the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may be switched on half way and this could lead to a halt to the update.
Read more: Ios 9 release still in the schedule despite the WatchOS delay in the review of iOS 9: The least exciting, but the best update from iOS 9: How to prepare for the new iPhone OS.
You should also make sure that you have seen the checklist of all things before you download, to prevent things going wrong and to protect themselves, if they do so, but if you want it, iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that will accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton just a slogan: "Full attack."
The World Cup second stressed before the launch in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing more to lose."
53 points separate the race champion before the night in Singapore on this sunday of title defenders and two-tier champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve seasonal races and is shooting the floodlit Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
2009 and last year the 30 year old Brite could win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state at the Great Price of Singapore will have influence is not yet clear.
Since days a Dunstglock hangs over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen," opened three months ago, added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the cure.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the Federal Book of First Class and honorary citizens of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation, which took the chair to Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" is seen as an expression of its affinity with the spa town.
Neighborhood office is looking for direct contact.
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined together under the cloak of the Social Foundation and a new one-stop shop in the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to discussions, they can also participate in courses.
The Social Foundation departs from the mountain into the city centre.
More specifically, the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new neighborhood office was opened there recently.
Here, right next to the shopping market, people from now on, receive information on issues such as care insurance, health care and nursing homes.
For years we have established our outpatient care service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are an endless number of questions.
"It is not uncommon to use many of the benefits of the funds, because the complexity of the insurance industry is scarcely understood," explained the new Haushofer in Jutta Weigand, who, as a business manager, was responsible for the Antonistift and the Civic Hospital, as well as for the ambulatory service "Amadeus."
In addition to the consultation, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
In this case, the Saludis was taken on board.
It is therefore possible to use additional offers such as explosion prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the senior centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Center for Care and Care," described Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre will include both executives in demographic change.
Because of this, a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual cities of Bamberg is essential in the future.
In addition, mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized the inauguration ceremony, the neighborhood office also dedicates itself to the association of the United States: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular sociable rest."
In this way, the Social Foundation can make a big contribution to the fact that senior citizens can live as independently as possible in their familiar environment.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16: 00 to 18: 00 and on Saturdays from 10: 00 to 12: 00.

On Friday evening, on Friday evening, at 11.45 p.m., three young men were on foot in the direction of Salmünster on Friday evening, at 11.45 p.m., on Friday evening.
One out of the group, a 17 year old Afghan, followed according to the police of his two friends in a distance of about five meters, and called them that we should wait for him.
At that time the group was at the height of the bft-gas station.
There were also three people in the area of the petrol station.
One of these men now cries out to young people and beat them into the face.
The victim suffered a fall in the nose and blood strongly.
When his two friends rushed and appeased on the racquet, he initially dropped out of his victim.
From his friends, the last young man was brought home.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car up to their homes and, on several occasions, took the lead.
When you no longer saw the vehicle, the injured were in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
He was once again attacked by the racquet and other male figure.

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice and invests 310.000 Euro.
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice by Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felenz.
It is also a pleasure to listen to the audience of Bernd Bormann, Wirtschaftsförderung Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places on the country there is a lack of doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: There, Dr. Frank Müller takes the practice on 1 October.
While Ursel Hospital is retiring to retirement, her husband Karl-Heinrich will continue his successor in the next few months.
After a period of reconstruction, Müller opened the practice on 12 October, until then, until then, it invests €310000 in the premises at St. Marcellusstraße 6.
At first glance, I was sympathetic to the idea of Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who at the moment took part in the apprenticeship in the hospital at the hospital and took part in the practice at the end of the year.
"We always had in mind that garbage would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felenz and laughs.
"When it was, I just called it."
Mrs. Müller liked the idea of using his own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"Proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to know and accompany the families for the years."
As an advantage he will soon be his own boss.
And thus it was agreed that the garbage collectors bought the house with practice.
At the same time, however, they will continue to be at fault-hausen-Vilsen.
The two-year Family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medizinstudium in Hannover followed stations in several doctors "offices and in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a doctor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed Chief of Staff in Diepholz County in 2009 and is a volunteer in the DRK-readiness of fault-hausen-Vilsen.
From the 19th of September, practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Feldingen is working as a family doctor, his wife Ursel has specialized in gastroenterology.
The garbage collection, both internists, want to establish themselves as a physician.
"Endoscopy therefore comes out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic examinations as well as long-term and load-rating EKGS.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
A grant of a total of €50000 will receive the waste manager as part of a support programme for the district (€25000) and the community (12500 euros) and the municipality (EUR 12500).
"This shows how proud and glad we are that practice is continuing," says Samtiard debürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
Approximately 2000 patients, according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, receive each quarter in the practice field, in the north German average practice it is about 500.
In Asendorf there is a further house doctor's practice.
A positive side effect of the practice assumed by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to the Ursel Trail.
If no successor had been found, it would have gone.
For example, if you visit us, you will still be looking for a familiar face: The seven medical specialists and the cleaning force will take care of the field.
Their departure ends in an era in Asendorf, after all, the medical profession practised there for 30 years.
"At the beginning, we had only two rooms," Ursel See is a sledgehammer.
A little nostalgia for her after a long time.
"But we are still living in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients," says the boarding house.
Your husband adds smiles: "We have a 6000 m2 plot."
"So far I have always pressed front of the garden, now this could be changed."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and will be happy to travel.
Croatia: "Let us leave the refugees through"
"Now border controls are on our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls on the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also be able to do so 'of course'.
The supply and safety of the people are at the forefront.
But it is also clear that there is a need for clear signals, "the Minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migration flows, including the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering the "corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian Government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue sending refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany, and might also set up corridors for the refugees.
However, the Minister of Justice, Vesna Györkös Znidar, did not.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," but Slovenia will intensify the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary.
However, the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenia does not want to freeze its borders for refugees, however.
"Every member must fill in its obligations, otherwise the system will not work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian Government announced, the first refugees had already tried in the evening hours of Tuesday to pass Tovarnik / Sid pass in eastern Croatia to avoid the registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to the local media, since then Croatian Tovarnik has been a permanent police force with new refugees.
They are predominantly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in use.
In the next few days, his country with around 4 000 refugees, Minister of Interior Ranko Ostojic, is counting on his country.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, towards Croatia, agreed to the Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was, the people wanted to take certain routes: "Neither we nor do we want to do so," it said.
According to media reports, at least in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, in the course of the day would expect more buses.
From Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants were travelling the whole night from the Macedonian border, which was about 500 kilometres away from Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has admitted, so the police have told us that we are going to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
As a result, the previous Balkan Route of Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, as it has already been predicted, could now come to a slightly farther west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive cross-border control"
Croatia's Minister of Internal Affairs, Ostojic, had previously stressed that his country had prepared similar plans for exceptional situations in the case of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention it, but he pointed out that, as a non-Schengen member, Croatia has' comprehensive cross-border control '.
They carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area.
Slovenia has been a part of this since 2007, and the EU partners have been providing good evidence of the standard of border controls since 2007.
On the Serbian side, there are still some 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they had spent the last night at Mount Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now wish to travel to the Croatian border remains unclear.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Mr Nebojsa Stefanovic, tried to reassure Wednesday morning at a local headline in Horgos: It is premature to discuss alternative routes for refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
We are not talking about very high numbers of refugees at the moment.
It is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Aid from migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: In some parts of the border, there are still 20 years after the end of the Bosnian war still uncleared mines.
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mines were sent to the border region.
Cross-border hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million.
Supranonok is to have belonged to a ring of cybercrime, which has been accused of having always been able to gain insight into unreleased financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The exploited information should have made insider dealings in the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of over $100 million was put in place.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are finally caught ', that is to say in the SEC communication.
The processes against 32 other defendants in the case lasted.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted both in the US and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospizool Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years.
There is a lot of activity in the area around Mannheim.
People are doing their worries, sometimes a quick walk, partly relaxing.
You control the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalons at the main square.
Keep in line with the railways.
Vibrating, beating life at the wonderful autumn sun ticket and in the middle of four large panels each with the title "Before I die...."
The Ecumenical Hospice Service drew attention to its 20-year anniversary with this campaign, and it has met with mixed reactions.
"It is about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Service is also available to the passers-by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteer staff.
While some people spontaneously come to Kreide and say "my life in favor," "read" my life in favor, "" read "with the camper by the United States," "stop the war," or "not long suffer" is added, others remain short, read, say phrases like "so far I'm not yet" and then go on.
Time and again, there is little discussion about the action in itself, about the life, the way of dying.
Peter Hübinger is also present on site.
"Only if I make it clear that eventually will come to the end of this world, I can live responsibly," says the director of the diakonic plant of Mannheim, which, together with the CaritasFederation, is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Relief Association.
Therefore, this high-profile action for the 20 year olds is good.
The fact that not everyone is willing to communicate publicly to the panels is understandable, after all, it is a very personal issue.
The issue of death and death remains subject to taboos, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has done a great deal to make people open.
A survey that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The founder of the death is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Through personal experience with the topic, they read a lot of literature and decided to become involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospemation was requested by appeal for honorary volunteers, they immediately reported and were involved in the establishment in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected persons and relatives in households, hospitals, nursing homes and in Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can work well with her task and the experiences and experiences in it.
"I see the life of a different waiting, it seems to be precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenic hospice service is free and confessional independent.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from family members and associations enables the training and training of the victims of death and trauma.
Every two years training courses for new employees are offered.
The boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be listed on postcards.
FedEx earnings mixed, financial prospects for 2016 lowered
FedEx reports disappointing results for the final quarter, and the delivery of a Gigant has reduced his win-win position to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his missile service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for their holidays.
At this time last year FedEx announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share fell to over 2.5 percent in pre-market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10,40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that will end next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected expectations according to a survey of FactSet 10.84 $.
In spite of the price increases, which are an average of 4.9%, and on 4 January, the less prospect is going to be effective and, in spite of higher charges for drilling heavy loads of heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November onwards.
The company said that it is still expected that earnings will increase compared to the previous year, owing to cost-cutting, higher revenues, and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides solid returns in considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade. "
Plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS, which plans to employ 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to 2,42 $per share, just behind the $2,44 $per share, which the 12 of Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decrease in international priority delivery in recent years, which resulted in sales in its unit express shipment to Stagnung.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales rose 29 percent in ground transport, but the operating result was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded a higher income due to higher prices, while the result of higher labour costs fell in freight business.
In the pre-market trading, about one hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by 3,85 $, or 2.5%, at 150,15 $.
On Tuesday, they had 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent at a record high on 11 June.
On her most anticipated part-session in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spent two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it was time to raise the interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Looming over them at the end of the decorated, two-story session is a wall of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should place the nation's economic interests before all other things.
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximizing US employment and price stability.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed has recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be frozen from the unprecedented incentive of the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data on the economy show that it is growing solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may make the already cautious Fed representative anxious to reinforce this volatility by raising interest rates for federal bonds - and even a quarter of the percentage point.
"Obviously the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they see," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economat at the Maklercompany Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were in search of a pretext to not increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which creates uncertainty for the financial market itself.
Roughly half of the economists who have recently been questioned by Bloomberg have predicted a rate hike this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to be waiting, with a key indicator, with only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless it can mitigate the blow by promising that a further increase is a long way off.
On Tuesday in the Dow Jones Industrial average at 228,89 points or about 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The campaign was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintained the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise for the Fed to lift the sentences at this point, "he said.
If it does, "it should go a long way in its statement to reassure financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that an interest-rate hike would reassure the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to increase the rate of 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that, this year, despite the appeals from liberals that more economic progress would be required, it would expect an increase in the sentence.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years, and near the level that the Fed regards as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And, though inflation has been consistently below the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed's representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdite, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world added at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average was more than 16% below its peak in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would reduce global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now being nearly 10% lower than the high of May.
For the Fed's representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculations, when interest rates should be increased.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of China's economy in the last few weeks would not have occurred, they would take the reins in this sitting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former US Federal Reserve staff member.
Now he says that they will wait at least one month to better control the effect.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will affect the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so it should not be involved in technical decision-making.
But, in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint of the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the world.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly interdependent, the Fed leaders can expect not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Its decision-making is "more art as science," said Zachary Karabell, Head of the global strategy for asset management of the company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, observed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to economic fundamentals."
A member of the Federal Open Market Committee, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he argues in favour of raising interest rates in 1998-1999.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions, "despite a limited impact on growth in the US," he said.
A year later, the Fed's representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability into the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 collapse of the market, said Adam S. Poznań, a former member of the Board of the Bank of England.
The recent turmoil does not come close to that level, he said.
"You certainly do not want to get into the situation in which she fears of an interest-rate hike, because the markets are getting exciting," said Poznań, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should be ahead of time.

Hoyerswerda: Small living aid for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany.
A warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support altruistic asylum seekers in the city.
Among them Petra and Klaus Heine are among them.
Petra Heine is a teacher and a teacher.
Even with her 74 lungs, she is still happy to teach them.
Every Thursday it will do it in the asylum seeker at the Dillinger Straße.
It helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is a very different lesson from a real school.
Brazil's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS is trying to make a shocking contribution to educating women on the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding, and it does so with the presentation of baby-eating pictures that are painted in breasts that are painted by unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are forced to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The Municipal Council of Bernried approved the construction application for the Euro 2.3 million sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flatter for solar panels.
The plans for the long-awaited Turnuck construction at the Bernrieder Sportfield are a step forward step by step: In the most recent municipal meeting, the prepared construction application was unanimously approved without major discussions.
Previously, the body had, among other things, adopted a proposal for a statutory "exemption" of "liberation" from the current building plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form regarding roof construction.
As a result, a "saddle roof with non-joined first and roof" is to be built.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels: "This gives us a wonderful large southern roof together," declared mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In the case of "liberation," it was about the roof that, for energy reasons - unlike in the building plan - is supposed to be less than ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was necessary because the layout of the building plan does not allow for "exceptions" - whereas the Bernrieder municipal council, as a rule, tends to take a more restrictive approach in the case of liberating applications.
But the project is not a recurring project: "We are not creating a precedent," so Steigenberger.
Post office building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and of SV Bernried.
The cost is approximately EUR 2.3 million.
Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter high hall will now be submitted to the landing board for examination.
Clinic Peißenberg rides to Schongau.
The hospital Peißenberg is said to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) is the new medical director at the hospital Schongau.
The station as well as the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is demonstrated by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the Landkreis, the holder of the estate Andrea Jochner-White.
However, a decision on this is subject to the Supervisory Board, and the meeting will take place next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, then all of the under 50 staff would be further employed in the hospital in Peißenberg.
The vast majority should move with fishermen and the existing interior station to Schongau.
The rooms are present.
In Weilheim, employees who are not able to go to Schongau are offered a job in Weilheim, so Jochner-Weiß is.
The employees are informed of the plans.
The change is due to the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year, and now switches to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who is to take the succession, according to Jochner-white, the name "Fischer" came into play, which agreed to take over the lead from 1 October and to switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a "appreciation" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "inner medicine," so Jochner-white.
Fischer specializes in pacemaker and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specialises in gastroenterological disorders.
Over the next two years, fishermen with his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the miners, who still have more than 35 beds, will finally be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
Until now, the district had planned for 2018 if the current rehabilitation at the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Landrätin Jochner-White, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed rumours that the house, which is in possession of the federal state, is to be used in future as shelter for asylum seekers.
"This is what I say," but Jochner-Weiß has not been able to say that Jochner-White could say that there are several considerations.
At the moment there is a short-term care of Caritas and a daily clinic.
"What was better could not happen to us, such an opportunity did not happen again," so Fischer took over the quasi-move to the Lech, which was received by the employees "positive and very sympathetic."
There has been no real prospect for the House in which fishermen have been working as the chief doctor for more than 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer's colleagues to take over the position of the medical director.
In recent decades, the hospital Peißenberg (once 100 beds) has been threatened repeatedly by closure, departments have been closed, for example, surgery and obstinacy.
The handball of the Rhein-Neckar Lion is called for tonight (20.15 p.m.) at the Bergisch HC.

In interrogation, the 20-year-old man killed the young people and threw their corpses into a channel in Rockenhausen.
Since Saturday 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate has been the victim of a violent crime.
The wife of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening at Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, such as the Public Prosecutor's Office and the police on Wednesday.
As a suspected, a 20-year-old is also a 20-year-old, who, according to the fact, said that he and the investigators led to the site of the corpse.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not arrived at home on the eve of an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators met personal items of the victim.

Refugees need shelter: A study warns of the housing gap.
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long since started.
With the incoming refugees and labour seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 each year.
To this end, a study is carried out on behalf of the mailing list "Social Housing."
By comparison, there are 260,000 units in Germany this year.
As a result, there are a total of 140,000 homes.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first accommodation accommodation.
Many people then come to the housing market and join the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, in the last year, less than half of all asylum seekers are paid for rent.
The negative development of the housing market, however, is not only the increase in the number of refugees.
The study also makes significant omissions in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is shooting a housing deficit that is growing year-on-year.
Currently there are already 750,000 accommodation units in the conurbations, "Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many people, therefore, lived in dormitories in large cities.
Young adults stayed longer in "Hotel Mama" because of the slack on the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen for the first time in the last few years.
To solve the problem, the Social Housing Alliance proposes a fresh start.
New incentives are to re-energise social housing.
In this way, the basic income tax should be abandoned, and the basic tax on subsidised housing should be suspended.
In addition, there is a need for attractive tax evasion.
The support programme for refugee accommodation in the Federal Bank KfW is already well received by cities and communities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the EUR 300 million available was available on Monday evening, with EUR 184 million.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free reign: Croatia and Slovenia go to a corridor which is one of them.
After Hungary, there is virtually no passage, since more and more refugees are choosing the route through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it is possible to pass through Slovenia to the north without any obstacles.
However, dangerous is the route.
Croatia wants to agree on the establishment of a corridor for refugees with neighbouring Slovenia.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian Minister for Home Affairs and, if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said the Croatian Minister for Home Affairs, Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have fled to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there.
500 people came across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV news RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the previous day.
New laws that came into force on the same day, moreover, make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: 'You can travel and we are preparing for this possibility'.
These people are there, it is women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it is people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police took up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU's neighbour Croatia.
Most of them have been media reports from Syria, Iran, and Afghanistan.
You came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia on foot.
In the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not cross border fences.
There are other dangers to border with that: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990 "s.
Mine clearance is now supposed to quickly create a safe passage.
According to Hungary, however, after the closure of the border, there are hardly any more refugees.
On Tuesday, the police were infected with 366 people.
Shortly before closing on Monday, it was still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a criminal offence.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
Those who have been sentenced threaten prison sentences of up to five years and expulsion from the country.
According to the Immigration Office, on Tuesday we received a total of 94 asylum requests on Tuesday, almost all - 93 - of the most important transition.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, there would have been still 40 refugees.
But virtually no one has any prospect of granting asylum in Hungary.
In Hungarian terms, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, there were only a few hundred refugees.
In Röszke it starts to clean up workers.
They collected the waste that tens of thousands of people had left behind in the last few weeks.
Barriers were removed, and one of the host farms in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to speak about this restructuring.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, over 20,000 migrants, according to government information, were still in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
In Freight, smaller groups of refugees regularly meet on foot.
Mayor Leed "Confronted" across the border
"We were occupied after the bridge on Sunday with the cleaning up, when suddenly ten people were at the entrance of the tent at the entrance of the tent," says Berber Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because of the fact that Germany had surprisingly abandoned rail transport with Austria on Sunday, but because of the flood of refugees, it was for them in Wernstein's End, "says Stadler, who immediately offered his help, and who, together with two other helpers and their cars, climbed the border into the district of Passau.
First of all, we used the unexpected guests first time, with a drink and a drink.
We have just said that we bring them to Passau from the car.
"That was, of course, for us," says Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man could not take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased with this," says Stadler.
On Sunday night in Wels, the stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau, in order to find, after the short-term cancellation, that railway traffic to Germany had been discontinued, but still to try and try again over the border.
The regional train was parked at the Inn in Wernstein on the border of Wernstein.
In Wernstein, cross-border crossing is generally high.
The bridge-gap association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday sociable, tags before a two-bridge run - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán now sends another tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the camp of Röszke, immediately when it comes to establishing structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has made it highly officially and publicly shown the Hungarian Government's attitude to the Dark League of National Socialism.
The suffering of this policy is not only those Austrians who are now facing chaos in border areas.
Even the flocks will have to discover that the "promised land," which she invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the ongoing flow of refugees and the approaching winter, to create humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be even greater - peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad on the Search for 355,000 Winterfixed Quarters
Konrad has all the hands to do with the refugee subsidy.
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to travel to the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first reception centre of Traiskirchen already got under control.
"We have no homeless more in Traiskirchen," he reported of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday, without any fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterpiece."
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation."
In total, Konrad anticipates a need for 85,000 Quarters in this year's year.
To meet the number, 35 000 accommodations must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But there is no bottomless pit," Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the locals.
They would have assured him that they would still be living in refugee camps for the next refugees.
"In Upper Austria it is good," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, explaining how the Church will help.
Big expectations also of the Asylum Coordinator are also in the ORF campaign "Helfen wie we."
On the platform, private individuals can provide accommodation with uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticised yesterday's standards for accommodation as "very high."
In times of emergency, it should not be possible for quarters to have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holder or the size of the upper parts.
For a temporary period, 'emergency standards' should apply.
The fact that, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in the accommodation, Konrad is based on his experience.
Mr President, I am an old gentleman, who is not without the face of falsehood on the face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not create costs for the Republic, as they themselves declared.
They want to increase their numbers to three to four.
So far, it has not been successful in its own refugee camps.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are obviously problems with authorisation.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being there is no opening-up of urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and the Design Center for the accommodation of refugees planning the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, because at the moment, without these measures, the person concerned says Klaus Luger (SP).
For an emergency, other sites are to be tested for their suitability.
Criticism is exercised by the city's chief of the distribution of the refugees within the federal state.
Other areas, too, must make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not lifted"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister, Horst Seehofer (CSU), head of state, Josef Pühringer (VP), on Monday, is actively involved in the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed.
The transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, it is precisely the border controls that are at issue here.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
In the case of the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity on the issue of refugees.
The fact that Austria is now introducing controls on its borders is a logical consequence for Pühringer from the actions of the Germans.
The next runtastic is a question of time
The general overhaul of the "New Shipyard" in the Linzer Industrial Line has been officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S & T, the rest (2700 square meters), is intended to be rented to young, innovative companies from the field of technology.
"In IT, the intelligent heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us," says S & T boss Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine investing in startup companies in the New Shipyard, and later also to acquire a new lease of life.
Right from the start, S & T intends to cooperate with the new neighbours - something that Lower Schaffhausen promises: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
1.7 million euros were invested by S & T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the TechCenter, which is one third of the city of Linz, the Land of Upper Austria and the Confederation (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years at S & T as well as TechCenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of residual area in the building are already rented, for a further 40 percent there are questions.
LIA-Peroni-holder opened second shop in the arcade.
Furla handbags are at the heart of the new shop.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to hire a dog.
This project had to break down the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt arcade: After all, it has now grown in the form of another business community.
In the Furla Shop vis-à-vis the business in which it sells bags, suitcases, shoes and garments from different manufacturers, it is now all about women's handbags of the Furla brand, which are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday the new shop is in operation.
Previously, several weeks were remodelled.
"I have long thought about whether I should open a shop," says Breit.
The decisive factor in the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were taken from the idea of a separate site where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the greater area of Linz that sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots.
Their fashion interests have been brought to the cradle by their mother.
I don't know if something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
While some women are looking for a nice hand bag, some women don't have the last security to answer them.
Maybe it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit is added.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump's ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called givers.
Some of them also combine with the billionaire, who wants to become the President of the US.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for emotions.
Whether it is xenophobic, journalists complain, or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency raises the campaign vigorously.
And cuts well in it.
This is also noted in the plush town of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the conciliator is a concept in the Winzerdorf (Winzerdorf) in the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200-inhabitants site is related to over -zig.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, in the campaign mode.
The brave town of Simone Wendel turned a movie about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about the goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I believe that they find this somewhat exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their KallstadtArt," says Simone Wendel.
The born Kallstadt filmed an amusing documentary about the town and its famous jumps, including Trump also the Ketchup family Heinz counts.
Trump, not known for modesty, comes to the "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014), saying that he would certainly succeed if he lived in Kallstadt.
To the King of the hearts he did not bring it there.
Although there is respect for the family's performance, but it also tends to believe that Trump is already a little more powerful, says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that "The Brulljesmacher" ("The Brulljesmacher") - too high German: The giver, says she says.
Trump, then, comes from the village of the givers.
Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and the US opened a restaurant for gold graves.
The foundation of the real estate group were first real estate acquisitions in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: Their desire to return to their homes in time, failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not include Trump, because he was once without authorisation, had the director of the Institute of Silesian History and People's Day, Roland Paul, explained at the start of the film.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant."
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants.
It has repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US, calling for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Like the polder, this is not so pleasant," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant cousin ("The Oma was a born Trump, the Opa was born-born Heinz").
The retired wine-maker sees the Americans rather distancing himself, "he is always so unwinding."
Does he think that Trump comes?
"I cannot imagine this," says the 72-year-old.
"He never worried about Kallstadt."
The guest house Veronika Schramm mentioned, as some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the family Heinz during a visit to the church organ donated what was generally well received.
"I cannot imagine this from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if he did not win the election, because "he has such radical views, I do not know if that is good."
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerborn Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
'my President is not, 'she says.
And, "the grapes are ripe without the president, Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12 000 journalists, including in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian town of Ramsau in Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain auction village."
From the hand of the Vice-President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800 inhabitants village in the National Park Berchtesgaden received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountaineering villages."
In the neighbouring country, the local Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain auction village" must have a minimum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
In spite of the attempts of Nine to take the loss of leadership in the Today Show, the ratings dominate the reviews.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson fly to Canberra to report on the loss of leader of the liberals, but there has been no major shifts in the ratings for Today.
The breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital, when Malcolm Turnbull made the fall of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderators of David Koch and Samantha Armydays, was held in London as part of a one-week series of international TV shows including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
For Australian TV viewers, this disadvantage did not seem to play a role, because Sunrise had an average of 397,000 spectators at the five capital cities, compared to that in the case of Beyond 339,000.
Today, a slight increase against the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure remained behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today, over the past few months, the gap has been closed to Sunrise.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise accounts for 314,000 viewers on an average of 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these mornings more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently lost father, who disagrees with his two children on the New Zealand coast, reached a very impressive figure of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics questioned whether Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered with a clear "yes."
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half an hour (17: 00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, showed an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17: 30 to 18: 00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Eddie McGuires's Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half an hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and in the second half an hour 720,000.
Hot-seat an average of 620,000.
The fall in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 17: 30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for $1 million, which did not make the McGuires show superfluous.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Mystery revealed?...
Lana All-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly appear to have who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, who finally ends Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was wrapped in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether they are the ones who have received the last rose.
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana JeangeFellows in the day before being three, you may have inadvertently given a hint of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips up to the final on Thursday firmly sealed
All three women left in a lyrical way, why wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should receive the last rose of Woods," could be their answers to the spoiler, who won the heart of Bachelors.
Jez.@-@ Fellows and Markoski both quickly called themselves - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one.
"From the moment when I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sams energies, I felt that they were fairly compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," said Jez.@-@ Fellows.
"Sarah comes with both feet on the earth, it makes so much fun to be with it," added Markoski.
I have seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
You feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood are suitable for couples.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the home visit last week made it clear that Wood could be "the One."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I am now fully satisfied with it," she said.
And when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose, if not her, she was puzzled.
"I do not know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor's degree will be published on Wednesday, 19: 30, at Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest following his move to the US - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tominson, and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches had banished Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a wrangling as it did the Aussie Rugby League Convertit on his first punt return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But tomed confided his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to play a punt return and also in the ongoing game after a breach of Reggie Bush.
Tominson continued to show his true face in the changing room after the match.
Instead of shouting his rookies before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tominson strengthened Hayne also publicly in his press conference after the match.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his broken catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patched on a pitch that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings.
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian entourage had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left after the Fumble to curse the pitch and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, we take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his origin debut in 2007, when a pass led to a Try for Queensland in his own target group.
All in all, it was a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne presented for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and post it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting to discuss the rights of gays.
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian roll-over field with gun force.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company seized Yukos and stopped his democratic efforts.
Free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria, because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the start of the FW Autumn FW in Great Wallstadt before a severe crisis in Bavaria's schools, when there are not new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
'otherwise we will get fault lines in the Bavarian education system '.
The Day Fee of the Free voter is held until Friday in the Lower Franconian municipality.
The main issues were, in fact, very different.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the free-voter meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will outsource the exam," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s.
"This is not the way we have to go, we have to deal with the causes," said the free voter.
Asylum-seekers want to postpone the free electorate as quickly as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum law: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW boss was critical of the fact that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states across the country."
"Bavaria pushes aside, others not."
'here we have to become more effective '.
But regional politics in Great WallCity is not to fall under the table.
A long-standing burner remains on the agenda: Education policy.
For the new school year, Culture Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot project at 47 Gymnasia, the pilot project "middle level plus," where an extension of the high school level was tested from three to four years - in the result it then takes nine years to the secondary school.
But that's what Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The issue of G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW boss.
We want freedom of choice for all Gymnasia who want it.
Free ride at G9 wherever you want it to be.

4 people killed after police rubber taps on demonstrators in Nepal shoot!
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal, after the police shot in a crowd of crowds, demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, a civil servant said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupanstreti, approximately 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Department of State officials, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside police stations, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
MR Dhakal said that the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before it hurts back to a rubberbelt.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the use of the rubberslave, which is known to be able to kill, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, seems to have produced such a high death rate.
The debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi argue that new provinces forming part of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent confrontations since the 10th.
August killed, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to distribute the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which for centuries had been governed centrally.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction site in the city planned
The land at the Emder Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt again.
The city is currently preparing for the marketing of the 4000 square meters area.
What is planned is a mixture of trade, commerce and housing - but there are not specific offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market approximately 4000 square meters of land in the immediate vicinity of the Old Post Youth Centre.
Preparations are under way at the moment.
It is planned to use the premises for a mixture of commerce, commerce and living.
There is a need to wait and see what the city has to offer.
Which investor is in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the land which is situated on the Ringstrasse / corner of Grand Road, bought a few months ago and left the building in front of it.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the housing settlement at the Small Sea at Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Some of them are still worried - they fear the selling of their leisure time.
For months behind closed doors were negotiated, drawn up, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday village on the small sea near Emden are on the table.
The prospective customer, the medium-sized enterprise "system construction," presented its plans for the first time, on Monday evening at the Centre's Committee on Development, for the first time.
Originally, this point had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the German Free Democratic Party (Christian Democrats), Ralf Behrends of the construction management company started the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said before the members of the council and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumours now.
The EUR 10-12 million has been going on for months in the debate.
Strong reactions among marine owners, who had come to the meeting, created the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, Meerbudenowner and member of the Executive Board of the representative of the Anlieger, Pro Hieve, claims: "This will be a giant clone that will surprise everyone else."
Moreover, like many other project critics, he fears that traffic will increase sharply as a result of the planned size of the plant: "There is a need for all bus loads coming up," says Schulz.
However, it is still open on the very good one hectare of the former restaurant.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still lacking, the building plans are still variable.
Zwilling's Elections in Gorillas im Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to announce a number of new talents in his gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian yesterday brought twins to the world.

NHC says 60% chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands.
The US National Hurricane Center predicted about 350 miles (560 km) south on Tuesday, south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, with a 60-percent chance to develop into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60-percent potential to create a tropical cyclist in the next two days, added the weather experts based in Miami.
Google starts a doubling donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (Google Inc.) announced a duplication campaign campaign to raise $11 million to humanitarian organizations that will help the thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations, as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach when posting the donation call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud wrote a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family, when she was seven years old, about her personal experiences.
"Our trip included many dark railway and bus routes, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But, as the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe has grown, many people, like my family, are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donation will be doubled to a value of 5.5 million on google.com / focused to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many are fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery continue to live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity-related operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have been proven to be effective, but most studies have been carried out on people who are ill-treated with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight relative to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected since 2007 in a study, comparing two types of obesity-surgery - heartshake and heartburn - to medical treatment for type 2 diabetes among people who were easily overweight.
The average BMI below those affected by this operation sank from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, BMI has remained in those who did not undergo surgical diabetes treatment approximately equal to 29.
Among those subjected to a surgical procedure, 36% of the disease suffered completely and at 28%.
In the medically-treated group, compared to that of diabetes, it was only one percent, and in some cases only about 2%.
In addition, the results in the controls on blood pressure, the triglyceride and the "bad" LDL cholesterol "generally were better in the 'surgical' group ', the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood mirror of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemogglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "Glycemic Control" - as you see in the improved hemoglobin in A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost weight in comparison with the Gastrektomy Group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved higher declines in the BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a complete elimination of the diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that leads operation to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was carried out in obese people subjected to an obesity-operation, some 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for the survival of the surgery patients, Blackstone pointed out that it was reassuring for people with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously when the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to make people take this seriously," she said.
I think that, as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes, which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard '.
Love story plays in the Hunsrück region.
It is an issue which is currently receiving more attention in the field of fiction: A young woman, during school hours, is unpopular and unsightly, and, after years of marriage, she meets with her youth, and this falls in love with her.

"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real resolution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to ethics studies.
He asked that, in the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Dealing with several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you must think about long-term solutions, such as real peace and development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of violence.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence, and also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attack of 11 September, suggesting that the violent reaction of the US was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush, and I told him that the way to resolve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he set up violence, and this caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four times the increase in the intake of suspended disinfectants by children in the last four years
Poison control centres in the United States report a nearly 400% increase in the number of children under the age of 12, who swallow very alcohol-based medicine, such as the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of revenue for children under the age of 12, the poison control centers, reported from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children come more and more frequently to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them go in the emergency recording," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants while some are doing to impress their friends or because of a mutation in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young disinfectants are only able to drink because of a cheap experience.
Young people have been eating disinfectants with soft alcohol in order to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child does not think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hands-disinfectants) are those that are paraffable.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapes and oranges, which are very appealing to children.
Deformations contain somewhere between 45 and 95% of alcohol.
Particularly in the case of young children, few injections of alcohol can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of Giftnotcall's hospital at the University of Kansas University, station Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you would not let a whisk around, but people leave that hand disinfectant in the reach of children, and when children come to it, then it is a quick chance to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl, who had recently taken four injections of gun-disinfectant in the school after strawberry, was taken into an emergency room for treatment.
Its alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is considered to be drunk by an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency medical doctor who treated them in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah heard their words and was not able to go when they arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors told them about night in a separate children's hospital at evidence of brain trauma, because the girl had fallen by alcohol and got his head, said Ritchey.
"This was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and to store suspended disinfectants outside the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died as a result of the swallowing of hang-out infections, which contained a toxic, non-declared ingredient.
Staff of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was quoted as an active substance.
In January, three students planned the fourth class in the state of New York to poison their "gema" teacher by putting anti-bacterial products around the classroom, "writes a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hanging disinfectants and banished from her room.
The police looked at the failed plan as "heath," and directed disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In the case of a bird accident on the crossbow between Nordring and Herder, a 33-year-old driver has been slightly injured in the accident.
A 60-year-old lorry driver drove on the cross-row in the direction of the roundabout industrial area and took it too late to see two pre-riding vehicles at the roundabout.
As a result, he took his truck to the rear of an audio track and wondered whether this vehicle was on a prior Ford Fiesta.
The police were responsible for the material damage of approximately EUR 10 000 in the accident-related vehicles.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer available and had to be towed.

The lack of title competition in the Scottish football dull Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they do not show any highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It is because the Rangers are not there.
People here are talking not only about the return of the Rangers.
You talk about the Old Firm.
You talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it is not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games.
I will turn things around, swears Deila.
Ronny Deila has accepted that Celtic will have to fight, but the Norwegian boss vibrates to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent leaving of the Champions League, the defeat against 10-men from Aberdeen, who now face five points clearly at the top of the table, followed.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come again."
Now we want to come out as soon as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel exactly that, but we must continue.
We really need really the support of Celtic, because that makes the player better.
It is so important to come together now.
Warburton cautious in January transfer
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, suggesting that he hurried some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is wary of the signing of new entrants and insists that he does not want to disturb the unity of the Ibrox brother.
The ex-boss of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic-target person Michu with referral notes

Unemployment in Scotland remains the same, while in the United Kingdom there is a total increase.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Japan's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was higher than the 5.5% annual, as shown by the figures from the National Statistics Office.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.

Why I am witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except in the case of late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I will sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the Giftspritze.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death.
The invitation was made in January for the first time in January, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day was closer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed, because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the USA and, since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media centers from 12 to five.
Who will be selected, it will watch it emotionally.
I cannot.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossips's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two-and-a-half hours of visits.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a pen and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma blamed me on Twitter to give up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner, how he wants it, and you get access.
I agree with her.
She admitted that she could "better put it," but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do.
Richard Glosip had trouble with some of the things that I have said and written.
He does not tell me what I have to write, and I would not do it even if he would do it.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public relations campaign against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I have made.
I will not go back over all the details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary.
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe that there is insufficient evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I will see him dying.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can address that.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death.
There is no doubt that, after a hard-pressed police chase chase, the Canning River is coming out of the Canning River.
The canning Vale policeman remained dry when he overthrew the man of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man of Perth to capture the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and marshy water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried "gently to persuade him to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale was summoned on Tuesday to a domestic peace break incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspects, they tried to escape towards Canning River.
But it did not go too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I do not come out, come and get me," said senior bot Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic to get his uniform wet, so he turned a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football players Ben Cousins is an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins moved his car to the ditch to escape alcohol control, and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts have been unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins bible.
Peter Moody claims that stewards have been trying to spy on him and are threatening to stop racing.
Peter Moody claims that stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Rudi said Fairfax Media, that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt-tail test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He held back 18 months because of charges of espionage and did not want to see it "look like too high-hanging grapes."
"I had nothing to say about it, and I have sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out," said Moody.
You know that it went further.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around the main, and I want my owners to think that I will try my best for them.
If they start thinking, I do not, then I should not be more trainers.
I have to consider what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department tried to spy on its stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I was asked - and offered him a job in my stables to supply information about what I do in my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
They seem to believe that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should surely take their noses, because they have failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulette, President of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Does this mean that I think it personally will be?
Did the RVL behave in a cowardly way and perhaps makes people out of trainers are responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people are thinking out there that I am there.
Perhaps they will have to accept my licence and I do not have any doubt that what I am talking about will now give them pause for thought.
But I have come to the point at which I do not care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to take a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The training level of the trainer was established with the long-lasting cobalt examination at Lidari, and the late Scratching led him to say that he was able to "throw his license on the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the undefeated Master of Black Caviar, called the racing day treatment rule "ridiculous," after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse tyres, which had broken the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this, "he said.
"One of my staff mistakenly put mud on the leg.
It could have been done last night.
It could have been the whole day yesterday, and that was the case.
But it was on the racing day as well.
A three-month disqualification for dealing with the pack on the race day could be confronted with an investigation into this matter.
It is a joke.
People who draw up these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We are all aware that we need rules, but we have gone too far," said Moody.
Men After Driven Returns
In the weekend, the police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist and followed driver curling in Cobram.
The cyclist was supplied with the helicopter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being taken by a car on Saturday morning at the Murray-Valley-highway.
The police said the car driver continued to continue without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia met the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be indicted for drivers and for failure to provide assistance and for other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year old man of Cobram, remains in hospital in a stable state.
Melbourne-Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes against rivals for claims to ring fights back.
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy has described critics of his players as an "agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney ROOSTERS Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referee has allowed storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening.
She was born in Los Angeles, California, and was born in Los Angeles, California, and was born in Los Angeles, California.
Bellamy defended the cap of his team and said that she was only concentrated on her "contact" in the Tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism by two leading trainers in his team give him confidence, as it means that they worry about being beaten by the Storm team.
"That happens again and again - I did not hear that Trent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they hit us 24: 2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real priority, and that has provided us with a change of direction for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he is probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is funny, as always appears at this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He played his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday night, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take a slap in the drain.
But now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a little bit worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they did not think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against ROOSTERS achieved a higher result than the game of Broncos against cowboys.
The shooting of the Broncos was probably a good game, I have not seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two other tests in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points?
For me, it is the game plans.
If they mention it, it means that we will be meeting at a time.
The Storm team was free at this weekend, as they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday evening in the AAMI Park, starting from next Tuesday morning.
He got a $200,000 bail-out ($200,000).
A man, who may have a life sentence for his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kg of cocaine smuggled to Queensland, was released against a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and introduced in the month of August in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed how he met his co-defendants in the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possibly life-long penalty for trying to possess a commercial lot of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to have the whole lot and that could have been in the Café for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the threat of flight to Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics mother and stepfather had offered a bail of $200,000 for security together to secure his release.
"After reading the outrageous statements of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he will give his Australian and his Serbian pass, contact the police every day and stick to a curfew from 18: 00-06: 00.
Accident at A5 at Karlsruhe: Driver's report splits apart.
In the case of a road accident with three lorries on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three lorries involved had slowed down in the direction of Basle.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape at the last moment on the left, as reported by the police.
The carrier of the accident caused by the accident was completely different.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely locked for more than six hours until 2 p.m.
There has been a damage of EUR 122,000.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to entice paedophiles to send images.
A paedophile used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl, when it was asleep, turned into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
They saw it, found the confusing messages and alarmed immediately their mother.
The police took care of this and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered "respective" web searches, which used terms to search for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the civil servant that he had done it, because it would lead to "paedophile on the Internet" and he then "preached to be a policeman to scare them."
The Attorney Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that it is addictive to scare people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer of him, but said that it was because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said that he did it to attract them.
He said he was sick in the head when he drinks, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
MS Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the hop and the wine.
She also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and met the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Playstation used to talk to girls who saw much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment, to have admitted indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, to be in breach of the requirements on 25 January this year, and not to be in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg does not appear in the register of sexual criminals, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" should be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence by October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody due to hearings for other outstanding cases.
It was added to the directory of sexual offenders before the date of the sentence.
Lock-holders on a small border crossing to Germany from the European Union (Germany).
More and more refugees are picked up aside from the major control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers made people more at smaller border crossings out of fear of discovery and arrest.
On the Austrian side, a speaker of the federal police said.
There are more than 1000 refugees in the districts Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They walked across bridges and dams on the German side.
They are received by German police officers and will be sent to the registration office.
At Munich's main railway station, according to federal police figures, a clear increase in the number of refugees in comparison with the week's start on Wednesday.
Just until 8 a.m., about 700 people arrived in the capital city, said a speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, the city reached the city on Tuesday, in 1759.
Stuttgart: Snowstorm of tropical jet "Henry" in the southwest awaits.
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area above Western Europe, rivers currently flow into the land, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart.
In the last few days, the swamp of the tropical storm "Henry," which was drawn over the Atlantic in the last few days, was the head of the tropical storm "Henry."
Violent storms and thunderstorms are expected in particular in Baden.
According to DWD, up to Thursday morning even in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance region, we can expect from 60 to 90 km per hour.
So, on Friday, you can see the sun again.
The earth does: Every two years the car manufacturers show their novelties at the IAA.
In 2015, the first step is to move to the compact cars, which are currently being sold particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular need: About 28.1 percent of new registrations in this segment were found in August only in August.
This is also reflected at the IAA (Auditing Days 17-27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new upper and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the stores in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra will not be much more expensive.
Opel is launching one of the biggest rivals, VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.
In addition, Hesse offers a further diesel and petrol engines of 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / / 200 hp, which for the first time also include three-cylinder gasoline.
Unlike the most important competitor VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra was initially only known as a fifth athlete.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the combi, which is already visible at the IAA.
And what is going on next to the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault launches the fourth generation of its Astra competitor, Mégane.
At the trade fair the Mégane is to be seen exclusively as a fifth in a conventional and a more sporty GT version.
In trade, he comes to trade at the beginning of next year, and then as a combi.
Infiniti: Completely new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan depositary wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
With its winding lines, the compact Infiniti fits perfectly into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will get a petrol engine with at least 90 kW / 122 hp.
But there is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with a gasoline engine, including a newly developed 1.0-liter engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp.
The maximum torque depends on the manufacturer's specifications at 170 Newtonmeters (Nm).
The launch of the baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which is to be seen at the IAA.
On the other hand, the designer of the noble Citroën offerer mainly hand on the front side: The fridge was redrawn and the changed headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, especially the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen, and for the first time, Apples Carplay was integrated.
In addition, on the IAA in the compact class a number of revisions and new variants like the frozen Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are presented.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five m ² cell are degrading
The Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex-prisoner of the law enforcement agency Tegel right, which was used for months in a cell that was too small.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells.
The Federal Constitutional Court decided in a decision that was published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the parties can even hope for money when they have been locked up only a few days in the confined spaces (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
Thus, a former prisoner with his constitutional decree was successful in Karlsruhe: He was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space in Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated from the space of a single cell.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, was again on his feet, moved to a larger cell.
His arrest warrant because of the disgraceful detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed.
But the Constitutional Court passed the ruling of the Court of Berlin in Berlin, and returned the case for re-examination.
They are violating the human dignity of the man.
Court Court is now to decide on the level of compensation.
Even if, for legal reasons, there was only a few days of liability for compensation in the period in question, there was a claim for compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, "a stranglehold on the legal protection of personality" would be feared. "
The Court of Appeal now has to clarify the amount of the damage compensation.
In the past, the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
Only in April, they did not talk to a prisoner, because he was hiding naked in a cell.
According to a decision of 2011, unworthy of a cell without a separate toilet is unworthy of a decision of 2011.
In addition, on Wednesday, he also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which gave a prisoner, in a parallel case, to a discreditable place in a parallel event in November 2009.
The then plaintiff went from 15 to 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case for three months.
In recent weeks, the Berlin prisons have also hit the headlines due to lack of staff.
Therefore, prisoners are being slaughtered again and again 23 hours ago, the aggressiveness is rising, even as a result of the tense situation.
According to the legal control point, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to the lack of young people, 19 are to be removed in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: 'We are creating that'.
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is going on in Germany?
According to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accept a million refugees, according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year, according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has shown determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do it, and we are creating that."
What is to be given to Germany gives the following overview.
It is used according to various forecasts of between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Development Ministry) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) housing per year - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as in the past (250000 apartments).
Dramatically, however, the lack of housing is mainly in the case of affordable rental properties: Between 60 000 and 80 000 social housing prices are falling out of the rental price, and these especially favourable apartments will also apply for refugees.
Federal Minister of Agriculture, Barbara Hendricks (SPD), therefore, wants to double the subsidy, at present EUR 518 million to a billion euros.
Far too little is that from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to be produced per year, and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of EUR 6.4 billion per year.
The scientists and the Federal Minister of Germany are in agreement that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it is estimated that 55 percent of the people in Germany could be working in Germany in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them in the first place, although Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation, was criticised.
But it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find jobs in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migrant researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, there has been a political change, according to Thrernhardt, from the prohibition of the ban on refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was previously a ban on the prohibition of asylum seekers for up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residency obligation that restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, also because of the shortage of specialist staff, the majority view is that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of German skills.
Up to now, there has not been a sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most commonly conveyed through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, in the opinion of Thränhardt, the royal path to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration found that only a few mature parents had their children in the Kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 per cent: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Department.
To convince the family of the advantages of Kita, the administration distributes handbooks in different languages.
If the need for educators is greatly increased by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - for example, by allowing more specialised schools.
In the countries pupils are prepared for teaching in a welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers, who only have qualifications in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Plant estimates that approximately 20% of the refugees in Germany want to study.
As a matter of principle, not a federal state of asylum is forbidden, or the only exception was Berlin, Innensenator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Student-willing refugees could be made easier to access the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or toleration do not receive any benefits under the law on asylum-seekers when they begin studying.
The latter do not, in principle, receive any Bafög, since they do not fall within the circle of those who are ill.
Patient refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years, in order to be able to buy Bafög, from 1 January 2016, this gap is reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed down, call Steffen Krach, Berlin's Secretary of State for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk Potsdam.
The students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of its identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing state-church right to a new rule of religion.
It would also be important to set up an Islamic welfare federation, which will take care of the new arrivals professionally.
The rights also include duties.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must be able to reach clear points of contact and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it some control.
This includes a willingness to take resolute action against religious fundamentalism.
The head of the Muslim central council, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to arrest such conflicts in Germany, "have immediately their right to get here, in Germany," he said in the Bavarian broadcasting industry.
He proposed that the constitution be translated into Arabic.
In the future, integration will continue to be a matter for the whole of society.
This means that the majority society will have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more pressing.
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti-discrimination body for a decade and a general law on equality.
But it learns very slowly, as shown by the NSU murder series, where the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: As far as migrant organisations and groups of non-white Germans are demanding, and international agreements such as the anti-racism convention, Germany, are obliged to take place, it must become a reality in the coming years, if the country is to remain peaceful and take advantage of its new citizens - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany will be able to provide medical support to the refugees who have been expected to date, says doctor's President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"With regard to power and capacity, we create that," he said the day-to-day mirror.
However, for this to happen, additional money must be invested in the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asked to hand over all arrivals immediately upon registration.
Such services could be settled later with the Länder.
And, in the long run, it is highly questionable to cover so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum-seekers "performance law suggests.
Otherwise, it is in the case of doctors, in particular, that the language barriers are to be created.
Even so far, the Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has proved that migrants are better informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctors' practices, it would be necessary to take up interpreting costs.
However, many refugees would be already with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulance.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, there are considerably more untreated disabilities, and young people are talking about HIV.
In the first half of the 20th century, Montgomery was a member of the USS Enterprise-D, where he was assigned to the USS Enterprise-D, where he was assigned to the USS Enterprise-D.
"Parasite or tuberculosis" is not so difficult to recognize, "and, in terms of the shortage of doctors, the refugees may even have relief in sight.
The Syrians would have a highly developed education system, including a number of refugees, even doctors.
In order to be able to practise, however, they would have to prove their skills, and may have to take place again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany, according to estimates by the German Federal Institute of Therapy (BPtK), are mentally ill: Most suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatised in Germany.
If you suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder, there are so-called flashbacks with breathing, cheating, heart attack and death fear.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong hortness and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from chronic, early treatment, Munz stated.
However, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum seekers may submit a request for psychotherapy in the social councils, the handling usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services, in general, technical workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses decide whether a therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to miscalculation, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream of a dream.
With the new staging "passion," Circus Probst goes back to the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the circus is waiting for the manege on the brick wall of dreams.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine without living with my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, an animal teacher and the Junior Junior.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current publishing house.
For more than 33 years the circus was in the hands of the family.
The family is therefore able to inspire the family in the blood.
"It is important for us to get people away from their everyday life and take them in a completely different world for two hours," emphasises the 27-year-old Junior Junior.
"A cocktail with world-city flair," the director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the 3 000 km long tour can experience this flair now.
The programme of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
At the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with a sense of humour and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also know their craft.
With the hero of the silent film, the Cuban duo wants to record the Cuban duo.
Lightness and agility - with these words, they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is intended to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the circus also fascinates with dexterity and joint action.
To balance the wheel on a ball?
For He Yuan no problem.
It fascinates and frightens at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics, like little else and fascinates with her agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuses in the attitude of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also makes a statement: "It is not good for our animals, it is not good for us."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-legged artists," as they are affectionately called, will be saved by the eyes after every wish.
We want to work together with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not think about it, it does not want it in the manege.
So the first commandment: Good for the animals.
Especially on their zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland ponyhengst and a zebra, the family is proud of the family.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, was our little Jumbo da," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the circus.
So I think there is something to be done for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "No matter whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always give our best and are with all our hearts."
The Circus Probst is open from the 17th to the 20th of September daily at 17 and 20 o'clock.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm.
Thursday is the family day, for the presentation at 5 pm, prices are reduced.
Furthermore, the animal show is open daily from 10: 00 to 18: 00.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds the wrong speech in Parliament
Dr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained untouched, but the video of the case spread quickly through the social media.
The opening of this Parliament has also been tarnished by statements by Members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them that they should accompany the speech by Mr Mugabe and Mr Mugabe.
In the past month, they had raised it and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition leaders received SMS messages on their mobile phones, who warned them to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number not displayed, but it has the title 'death', he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the affected Members of Parliament that immunity ends in Parliament and, once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesperson said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "worried" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the services of the company.
HP will later be divided into two publicly traded companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its service business.
The expected job losses result in a burden of more than $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, to lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than it is today, and we have a broad and deepened portfolio of businesses supporting companies in the transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company we are better placed than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than €50 billion in annual turnover and "will focus on the delivery of unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for companies," so a statement by the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930 "s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and whose Palo Alto garage was named" the birthplace of Silicon Valley. "
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action of HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US-Tech companies, is the latest in this field, which is based on the conviction that narrowly focused companies perform better.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that team mates face the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the wounded Jack Wilshere must stand.
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is carried out according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss the next four games for England at least, and, given its history, his participation in the European Championship next summer will certainly remain uncertain.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season after a separate ankle injury, and then returned to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not threaten career," said Wenger.
It is a bone that does not heal properly.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in touch with his ankle or with the injuries he had previously had.
This may be true in purely medical terms, but, like Wenger, there is a risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study by Premier injuries Ltd is listed 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of arsenals of 157 league games in the last five times.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six eight game periods since 2007 / 08, which have seen most injuries.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from a violation, you have a period of time, a period in which you must strengthen your body and win combat power," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilises, I am confident that he will do it and he will undergo a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and the players who need to give a little respite," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite, through Group F, the Maksime Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most important acts of intimidation in Europe.
Dynamo is also available after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with 3.2 being measured on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal pulled the lesson of the last season with the Champions League capitulation to Monaco, and is still driven by the far hope, with his management, to lead the club to its first Euro Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
Arsenal has never worked.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in the business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamer.
FriendsFest: The comedy show, which gives us serious lessons on man-friendly friendships.
The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up, now even more desperate than ever before, how suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men between 20 and 45 in the UK, and it is three times more for men than women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Misericious (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of challenging the culture, preventing men from seeking help when they need them.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to master this challenge.
An up-to-date study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that, if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy spirit," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends, so that friendship can work.
In the age of communication through social media, with its focus on style on substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear to be life-funny and successful, even if in reality the isolation is dominated.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call it: Money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And like a videogame inventor and billionaire recently, money can really not buy money.
The beautiful thing about Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which was marked by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler frequent hugs, moments at the football look in cozy armchairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can in any case be able to refer to them, even if they often refuse to explore fully their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone community, I explained:... "" my listening role for people who feel depressed and self-disillusioned have really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference. "
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I come together" has a huge impact, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term care mechanisms.
She proudly presents the little moments of men's friendships.
So much my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend comedy Central FriendsFest with the meeting of the day completely redesigned, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you look around at Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
We never know what kind of difference your friendship might be.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest.
Maria meets to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
In his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday, Maria meets with the help of PSG to teach in Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held the course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prinzenplatz stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his champion league debut as a PSG player, who launched the French champion, but then lost a number of occasions before she finally increased her lead, when Cavani achieved a headballgate in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as it will not only seek the qualification for the round of Chad, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-final in each of the last three campaigns.
But while he got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blancs's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances in front of the gate, later in the game against his hometown team and against the club, with which he began his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it is a good start to win 2-0, to cause problems and relax, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect in the course of the season," said Blanc.
"This augurs well.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not achieve one or two more gates. '
After his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, he returned to the Paris team, who was able to make a 2: 2 undecided on his own place in the first league on the weekend, but he was handed out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing stormy was called the man who could take the PSG to the next level in Europe, when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month, and he indicated why, when he ran in Marco Verrattis Pass, he went to Johan Wiland over the long corner of the network.
However, if anyone thought that PSG would achieve a great victory, it was disappointed.
Malmö, which hit Celtic in a play-off to achieve this stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players in the field, with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field, a heavy opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far to Kevin's posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in their attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes came up, with some miscarriages and bad conclusions, not least of Ibrahim himovic, who had not completed the first half of five trials in the first half, and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he proved much more adept when he put his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahim himovic, who turned the Di Mary into a drummer, who was brought by Wiland in the 52nd minute on the post...
The second gate was finally short after the hour mark thanks to Cavani.
That ended with all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Vilnius to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low, before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi found a gate at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegians said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
Skills games are not enough. "
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion of equity sales.
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, who is affected by soaring commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday, through a share sale as part of its huge debt agency plan.
The London registered company, Glencore, said in a statement that it sold new shares in the value of around $1.6 billion to repay its own debt.

Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of the broader plans to pay around one-third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new equity stake in 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday.

The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, takes place on 25 September and returns President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.

"President Xi's visit will provide the opportunity to extend American-Chinese cooperation in a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to engage in a constructive approach to areas of disagreement," adds the statement.
XI, whose visit was announced in February, is expected to take several US technology leaders on its way to Washington in Seattle before traveling to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September.
It is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of disputed issues, including Washington's concerns over China's alleged cyber espionage and growing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

Xavi: PEP Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
World and European Champions Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015.
A few years ago, the FC Bayern announced the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played at the time for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish masters, three times champions, four Champions League winners, two times World Champions, two times European champions, a world champion, the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the 35-year-old took over the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now tells that he was already in front of the Euro 2008 before the farewell of Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we do nothing," he says.
And that also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was a offer of Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me".
Memory: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi was not changed
The change, however, did not come about.
And the most important man today works for the German record master: PEP Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has contracted Guardiola and I have played a great EM."
"PEP told me that I couldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"He got me with me."
Who knows how Bavaria's 2008 / 2009 season would run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, folded the Red Mark (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated the premier class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays in a variety of film productions.
Matt Damon opposed the Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said that she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of the Sunday Night of HBOs Project Greenlight, the expert actor Brown said, when she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, on a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"When we talk about diversity, then do it in the occupation of the film, and not in the occupation of the show," assured Damon.
Brown responded shocked, with insulted disbelief and called "Hoo! WoW, okay" when the comments of the actor of The Martian took hold.
Damon and Brown joined the producers of Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers in order to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to call on people to think about - whoever the director will be - how they treat the figure of Harmony," Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a Nutte that is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People opted for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights of the film; Damon replied that their direction 'in the end could give us something we do not want. "
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded against disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter users Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing "Matt Damon talking about the only black person in space, so he can explain its diversity - that is SO WEISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retreats and 4,000 Likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teenage boy Michael Brown was killed by a white police in 2014, the motion Black Lives Matter achieved nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to put a stop to discriminatory practices against colour.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Album still matte," (albums still have their meanings) he said.
Like books and black life, even albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Movement Black Lives Matter published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News Person Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered to be a hate group.
"The Network Black Lives Matter is a love group," said the guide.

Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already taken the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior 'praises the first champion
The first athlete, who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening, was the first athlete to win the Great Price of $1 Million.
The competition show, which just finished her seventh season, had never experienced a competitive participant, who could complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season, there were two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, until the final.
The last task was to climb a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time, and he was the first athlete to finish the challenging phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished this challenge three times faster, making him the winner.
News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the $1 Million Grand Prix.
"I think it's amazing to think about it, I have never deserved more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E!
So suddenly.. as I can not even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed took over with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
After the rules the money goes to the fastest person.
"When there are more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How great the money is a wonderful price and the life changed, it gets the great explanation.
I do not think he has any qualms about this.
He has just been so happy with what he has done.
Masses of awards received him from fans.
He is a great guy and a father of family.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I should be beaten by someone, then I am glad that it is Isaac."
And I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an Eighth season, the shooting will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tiger Lies on Minnesota Twins over.
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
In the past, they used to be one of the best teams in the baseball league. Today, the Tigers are on the last course in the American League Central.
The Tigers were reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Twins 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins wasted an opportunity to rise in a slot of Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard.
For Detroit, if even for an evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word, which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories make fun, no matter how it comes," said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support, when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) suggested 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and allowed three Runs.
It was only his third successful start in the last nine games.
"I want to close this year strongly," said Simon.
It is difficult to throw any game in the Bullpen, and so I want to concentrate very much on the game.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two Runs, his first rbis since mid-August.
It was the first three-stroke hit by Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He has fared well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (jumping training), was much better seen in the Bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three Runs at the end of the seventh Innings, the Twins have had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center of Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left line.
At the end of World War II, he became a member of the Board of Directors of the United States and the United States of America.
Hardy overran the wall, the only man he faced, in front of the designated Rookie drummer, Miguel Sano, who broke a two-run for the right wing Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the end-run at the second, Verhagen introduced the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a Double Play.
It was in the Major League leader 27 times in this season that Plouffe played a Double Play
After Detroit added an insurance-run at the end of 9th Innings, a RBI double against the Closer won the Tiger Bruce Rondon and scored 5-4.
The right margin, however, stood out for its fifth save, Sano, at three pitches.
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an unmovable Phil Hughes.
The tiger had reached three Runs in the first two sessions against the right party veterans who had been removed from the injury list before the game, after missing more than a month because of a backrest.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted to do," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches in third place."
After they received the Leadoff-Batter in the first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play that made a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the Runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers put in the second one, achieved a one-out double of Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center-Field-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a great blow," said Twins's manager Paul Molitor.
He has not done very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a Pitch-Count, scored no points in the third Inning, before he was replaced by the relever of A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there was three Runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
Notes: Tiger RHP Anibal Sanchez left off because of injury to the hangover.
He is studied by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injury list because of a shoulder strap, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris will be removed from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four start with the tiger since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since the 20th of August because of a rage in the right-hand hip.
The Tiger and the Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Wei otas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73).
Hundreds of refugees are to be killed in Wiesbaden.
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
Its arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
In this way, people are supposed to be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, like the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening.
They equated with 450 to 750 incoming refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessen state have been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees may be temporarily suspended there.
They should then be distributed to other communities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government office of the first time, responsible for the first time took over 7500 people in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau also have emergency accommodation in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, believes that military action with German involvement in Syria is a possibility.
'I believe that decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany ', he said.
He accused the European States of 'collective guidance'.
Four years ago, one would have been glad that the Celtic army had passed away from Germany.
"Now the conflict is running out in front of our door," he said in the German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also introduced checks on its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Home Secretary, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF, after Hungary no one is being returned.
Germany, too, has sent no refugees back to Austria.
"No, it is agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement whereby Germany could receive a certain number of refugees from Austria on a daily basis, Mikl-Leitner said, there have already been discussions between the Director-General of Public Security and German representatives on this matter.
Specific numbers did not mention them and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
Over the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit next week.
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls.
The EU Member States have not so far been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU's Interior Ministers want to take a new start-up to the mandatory distribution of another 120 000 refugees next Tuesday (22 September).
In view of the strong refugee disaster in Germany, the Federal Government wants to give greater support to countries in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The Federal Government will manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel at the late Tuesday evening after almost four-year consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor of Germany in Berlin.
Merkel emphasized those people who needed protection would receive it.
But if you don't have a lead view, you cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The German Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "huge effort."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175 mile long border with Serbia in the night of Tuesday.
A few hours ago, the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania would also be closed with a fence.
This neighbouring country, unlike Serbia, is part of the EU.
Hungary wanted to prevent smugglers from seeking evading routes across Romania, said Hungary's Minister for Foreign Affairs Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, at the same time, there have been thousands of other migrants entering the Greek border.
Room sonde "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice cream of the Saturnmond Enceladus, a global Ocean hangs.
This includes researchers from observations of the room sonde "Cassini."
Thus, the moon is easy to navigate on its track around the Ringplaned.
This pigeon movement is small but nevertheless too large for a permanent body of celestial bodies, in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State of New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus."
Even longer, it was known that there had to be water under the ice cover of Enceladus fluid water.
For example, "Cassini" had already discovered Ice volcanoes in 2006 at the South Pole of the Saturnmond, feeding the water vapour and ice particles and thus feeding the so-called E-Ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not resolved.

No diet fruit - mangoes contain much sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But who wants to pay attention to his slim line is often rather discouraged by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - mainly saccharose.
Healthy are the exotic fruits: In them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. mainly consist of mangoes but a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta carotene.
Those who eat the fruits also support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When you buy, Mangos should not be too soft or too tight.
The shell colour alone is not enough to say just how ripe the fruit is - so also green mangoes can taste very tasty.
They should be stored in room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Taste it, of course, pure or sweet.
A mango also gives hearty dishes a special note.
It relaxes the slightly bitter taste of some of the leaf houses, such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a Mangochutney fits well to fish, poultry, lamb and game.

First Fordstorm, then distinctive Cold Front
In the next night it breaks in the valleys of the Alpine north side of the steam bath, as well-known Switzerland on Tuesday announced.
On Wednesday and in the night of Thursday, the hair of the hand is partly with storm force through the balustrades.
After the conciliation on Thursday morning, we are going through a striking cold front which brings heavy rain, wind and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a message, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep pressure area above the British Isles in a strong southwest flow.
On the alpine side of the Alps, during the night of the day, the valleys are flooded by the sun.
As a result, hair loss for up to Thursday morning winds in the tender valleys of between 60 and 100 km / h, in some cases and especially in the Urnerland with more than 100 km / h.

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city President Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday, a so-called nameless square in the Park on the Oppio Hill was christened on the name of the German reformator.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero," he is now recognised as a "German theologian of the Reformation."
The park is located in the heart of the old Rome next to the Coliseum.
The name was requested by the congregation of the Protestant Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled that the Protestants in the city of the popes for centuries as a minority were often able to live their faith only in secret.
With this place, in a symbolic way, its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) held a number of months in Rome as a young Augustiner in the year 1510 / 11.
He felt that the city was then a dead letter of scapegoats.
His negative impressions should have encouraged him, according to historians, in his later struggle against Rome.
At the beginning of the 19th century, he was a member of the Church of the Holy Roman Empire.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gold-plated) Dornenkrone is one of the main works painted by Otmar Alt for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated biblical texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not on the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now been released with magnificent images.
In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, which in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
Its "language" with colorful colours and imaginative forms has received the 75-year-old - but it is not synonymous with "funny" images.
On the contrary: Adapted to the respective themes, this may seem quite bleak.
For three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has taken a subjective artistic choice from the many themes of the book of all books.
There are cycles that are dedicated to issues such as cross-roads, potions, bids or faour.
Thus he spontaneously fascinates several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation, as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And here is the author Klaus Altepost, who has studied painting with the respective Bible.
He has interpreted the Bible, selected by Otmar Alt and translated into the present context, "translated."
These texts are as verbal mirrors of Alts painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotation from Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist who formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation here.
The jewelry book has golden verbs.
This allows the 75-year-olds to have twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately created for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode, and grew up in Berlin, coming from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"In that case the education had already started with the pipe," Otmar Alt remembers.
"I tried to work on that, in order to get myself back again with the Lord."
His second concern was to reassert art in the near future: "The perception of picture worlds is today marked by advertising, which is loud.
Symbolism is being squeezed out.
Artists have a different desire and laughter to show things.
Pictures have always something secret and are not decorative.
'in this respect, I am a dinosaur '.
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to let the viewer appear in the images, let it appear, discover and feel what power they have: "The image is looking for its counterpart."
Klaus Altepost and on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Comedy in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "always" was a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like how he understands life with his images."
We didn't take care to fully grasp the Bible, but chose the most important, mysterious topics for him.
"This was not a co-operation on eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the images, the text just described."
For Hans Möhler of Luther's publishing house, this work is an invitation to deepen his life and to find freedom. "
Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.
A portion of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open on November 15th in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction commencement for the BMX railway is approaching.
Plans have been made, placed in place, commissioned by companies to model earth poles for a round course: One year later, almost everything was finished - but prior to the official opening of the BMX railway, this has already come to an end.
Negligence in politics and administration provided for decline, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railways.
We are looking for a new place to stay. We are looking forward to welcoming you!
In October, the first local councillor, Sabine Mosebach, was able to communicate in the Children's and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year is still visible," she said.
It should then start with the work at the former indoor swimming pool without a "further commemorative break."
DFB is intensifying engagement with refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, leaving the Bundesliga at the weekend.
The football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and helps to help policy in coping with the problems that lie ahead.
"I consider that to be the biggest challenge of our country since reunification '.
"In principle, no one can say that I do not mind that I have nothing to do with that."
"This must be an interest for each individual to get to grips with this issue," said DFB-head Wolfgang kidney sbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he intends to discuss intensively the refugee situation in Germany.
"I will be in the chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor.
"The issue will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football could and would help.
The key course, however, must be the policy.
Therefore, the German Football Federation has extended its Refugee Initiative, "1: 0 for a Welcome" to four years.
"Via the Egidius-Braun-Foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019," said kidney sbach on the fringes of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's / Malta.
Some of the federal governments are also supporting this programme.
As early as this weekend, the 36 professional clubs have a clear signal when they are wearing on the left arm sleeves instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes) the printing "We will help #."
"We want to make it clear that everyone is to help wherever and how they can," said Leverkusens champion Rudi Völler the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and called the project a "matter of course."
"The refugee drama hits everyone, no one can be seen."
"We could not, no, we must use our power, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so badly," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheims Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."
On this Friday, the National Team of Women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Saale.
He described the support of refugees as "a great association of German football."
The fact that all 36 license associations had started their own projects in their own places was great.
It is also great that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1: 0 for a Welcome," which we have spent, is being lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the federal government, will provide EUR 300 000 each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already taken up the whole sum for 2015," reported kidney sbach.
Reports: SAP Head of Management loses an eye on the accident in the event of an accident.
The CEO of Europe's largest software corporation, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost the left eye due to a crash at the beginning of July.
In the case of the accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA, after midnight he fell on a water glass that he held in the left hand, reports the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He is almost dawning, was powerless, then moved away on the road - he told us so last week," quoted the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott, however, could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager is at the meeting and "fully employable."
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
"I am full of SAP, full in my job."
"Of course I was in regular contact with the supervisory board and its chairman Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ."
McDermott normally oscillates between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important to listen to the public with such a personal story, said the manager of the "SZ": "Everyone can do that."
"It's important to be back if you like it."

Football: BvB without Reus on Krasnodar: Weidenfeller im Tor
At Borussia Dortmund all expectations of a comeback from Marco Reus in the first group of the Europa League will be broken.
The national player will also be absent from the football league table in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7.00 p.m. / Sky).
"We cannot resort to it, unfortunately," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus on Sunday will be in the Bundesliga-top game against Leverkusen, the BVB-Coach will leave: "We are counting on a return from him to the training on Friday."
Due to the heavy loads of his pros, Tuchel will not only change his trunk to the Reus position.
So he announced a change on the goalkeeper's position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of the master keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trained at an absolute top level," the soccer teacher praised the world champion.
However, in the future in all the European League matches, Tuchel was open to the public in the future.
With a high probability, he will pay for the second match.

Robot Cars: Government wants to take the lead for Germany
Germany, according to the Federal Government's will, should be the leader in the transformation of the car industry.
The federal cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, provides for investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt was speaking on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Automesse IAA of a "new mobility age."
Automatic and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams, said Dobrindt.
He also intends to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, which will also meet representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid shift to digital radio.
A test route on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently developing to test new technology.
In order to avoid additional liability risks for the driver, the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments. "
Germany, for example, wants to promote international efforts to raise the maximum permissible speed for self-propelling cars from 10 to 130 km per hour.
The Federal Government is also in favour of changing the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for man as a driver.
In automatic driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics, highly automated driving on motorways by 2020 will be technically possible.
Nonetheless, driver-free vehicles on public roads are "only to be expected well after 2020."
The value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany estimate the authors of the study to around EUR 8.4 billion in 2025.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said the Social Democratic politician Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the case of accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
Still, German self-driving cars still see scepticism - much more than French or American.
A Wednesday at the AA submitted survey of the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Forses Institute on behalf of the audit company Decra comes to the conclusion that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years, 32 per cent will only grow in 20 years, 31 per cent do not believe at all at all.
In France, 21% of respondents expect self-powered cars by 2025, and 33% in the US.
In Germany, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-drive vehicle.
According to a survey by the Digital Federation of Bitkom, only seven per cent would agree to control the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, there could be 15 per cent of traffic flowing in the traffic, in Stau 45 percent.
Every fourth would leave the car to control under any circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis-EM.
From 25 September to 4 October 2010, Düsseldorf wants to compete with the title fight.
The final decision should be taken at the latest on 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The guys got it out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to bring the title, even without Timo," said German president Jörg Roßkopf during the EM-course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was at that time on the flight to a long-term sponsored sponsorship opportunity in China.
The 34 year old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo is the drawback, we are now no longer such a clear favorite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the betting list in Yekaterinburg, but also reminded the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time, Timo was also missing, and we became the European champion."
"We should be guided by this," said the world rankings-fifth.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has taken a serious injury on the right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was taken with a Tackling by Héctor Moreno and changed after a long treatment.

Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible.
It is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figure formation: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition of his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: Window mannequins, which, thanks to video projections, look alarmingly humane.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, has become the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say today that I am the Enfant terrible of Haute Couture, because I have white hair."
"In the past it was easy, now it is real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which will be seen on 18 September at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo Cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion potter has changed his initial opposition to a show about his person.
Actually he was against, because, "for me, an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
If you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been done in the Canadian Montreal and Paris stations.
"It's about so much more than beautiful dresses," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed whole piece of work, for which a lot of effort has been made: In order to freshen up the dolls, for example, a stylist has been committed.
14 tons of material, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, is carpeted according to Munich.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was still a special delicacy: A leather wear outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Also Gaulsey's old teddy can be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, timid designer walking attempt of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good pupil and bad in football) he attracted his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
Playing a doll would not have allowed his parents to play.
He later brought out of fashion.
He steel fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, such as Gaultier in Munich.
Later I bought it, of course, but I bought it.
He hasn't been able to pay the models for his first own fashion show.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Speaking Top as Mode Nic
In the past it used to take place on the long embroidery machines in and around chatting.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers, for example, for ceilings and curtains.
That alone no longer works, says Andreas Reinhardt, CEO of the Modespushle.
Instead, the fashion is again important.
In the early days of the conversation, mode played a greater role, and was then squeezed out by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt provides a few examples: Lace in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
At the same time, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past motives, is a growing potential.
Those who do not use niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Modesple is a member of the industry association of the top and embroideries in the industry.
Only they can wear the protected label.
Over the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have been broken.
Private shops and wholesale trade almost no longer exist.
Our products hardly ever reach customers in this way.
Today, mass goods are produced much cheaper in Asia, and are driven almost exclusively through chains.
Moreover, the export market is weakening, now to Russia and the US.
So there are sufficient reasons for new approaches.
The industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness, such as Cordula Bauer by the embroidery shadow in Falkenstein: "This year we have had a seal of quality which shows that we are able to produce ecologically and socially acceptable products'.
Reinhardt completes: "This applies also to the materials used."
President-elect Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the Lower Saxony Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroideries and lace.
In order to counter competition from Asia, high quality and innovative products have to be found.
That will take time and courage.
There is a tension between the most recent ideas of the designers and the companies, which, in particular, have to think economically, "says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a client base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter relaunched the historic snowball head.
The machine is stacking small chests in a few places on the machine.
The hottest gold enthusiasts in Bianca Hallebach-Kraule was inspired: "I could not start with traditional conversation."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewellery.
In a lavish process, she shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of chat - young and old," says Reuter.
It is also available in the USA, Australia and Finland, mainly to customers whose ancestors have lived in chatting and living, and who want to have a souvenir.
In this way, I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the hottest in the world.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends may not be touched, but Disney still dares to introduce a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins."
However, according to "Entertainment Weekly," the "Entertainment Weekly" is not a new version of the story, but rather a kind of sequel, which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the experience of the Nanny family with the family Banks in the world economic crisis in England.
Anyone who plays Poppin more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director says: Rob Marshall, most recently with Into the Woods in the cinema.
XI Much to open the world wider to the world
The economy needs to open wider to the outside in order to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday a group charged with steering the reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign investment and know-how, and to improve the strategies for start-ups," he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
To promote new start-ups and push ahead with reforms will bring new impetus and vitality, and provide a new place for economic growth, said Xi.
The leadership group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of rules on market access, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the population reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, guaranteeing a constitutional business environment and made the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also ease controls over the powers transferred to the companies, and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, further sectors are being opened up for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment, and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and deliver better services," said the statement.
Furthermore, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
Guaranteeing the right of lawyers to carry out their activities and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also attended Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury levels in predatory fishing.
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators and thus give consumers a much higher dose of nerve yields.
The consumer organization Foodwatch, who has a corresponding working paper of the EU, was critical of the plans: "Risks and side-effects of malfunctioning industrial and environmental policies are carried out with full force of pregnant women and infants," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Krugman, the limits of nerve poisoning for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as Hai- or swordfish, for economic reasons, are raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
Large predators, however, are already heavily burdened with mercury that, on the basis of the current limits, about 50 per cent of catches may not be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5% would be uncompromisable.
In exchange for this relaxation, the EU wants, according to Foodwatch, to tighten up the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
The food watch, however, calls it "trick," because smaller gravefish, such as carp, are often so low that they are already complying with the planned peak levels.
The reduction in the small-scale reduction is therefore "a perfidious distraction that helps the economy alone," explains Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for the people, which is very rich in the food chain, particularly in predatory fish.
The federal government therefore warns that "already small quantities can cause harm to the nervous system especially in the case of unborn infants.
The Federal Ministry of the Environment says on its homepage with regard to the current maximum levels, but that a "health hazard to the general population" should not be expected.
In particular, mercury enters the environment through the use of coal combustion.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, Germany's coal-fired power plants, Annalena Baerbock ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year, two-thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe, Rhine and Danube is "permanently and extensively exceeded" the "mirror" was quoted in the paper in March.
Last year, Europe's warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
