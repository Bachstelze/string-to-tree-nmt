Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, when it comes to meeting the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution we are talking about.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been growing for years.
Washington has criticised the continuing settlement of Israel and reproaches Netanyahu for a lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama-led deal to Iran's nuclear program has worsened the relationship of the two.
In March, Netanyahu held a controversial speech at the US Congress's invitation to the US Congress, which was seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech with Obama was not agreed, a meeting with reference to the upcoming election in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, professor to have shot his girlfriend shot.
In an emergency call, professor Shannon Lamb, with a slightly rude voice of the police, said that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his home.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" still live and is probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found the corpses of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was glued to a white block: "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I wanted to reverse it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman I ever loved," according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Lynn Buford said that university staff heard shooting at 10: 18.
He said that Lamb eventually made the fatal emergency cry.
By the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life, when the police took him.
A day after the shooting at university, students and lecturers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to give an image of what Lamb motivated.
The information published by the investigators at both ends of the state published detail, as well as what students and collaborators knew, helped to draw an image of a talented, but perhaps difficult, teacher.
Students said they were happy with his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he has no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both were taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose classrooms comprise 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there have been some problems with problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a bit excited and nervous, "as if something with him was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had asked the Delta State University for medical reasons and said that he had some health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion of so hard for the Lamb for him would not provide him with a guarantee for an automatic way to recruit as assistant professor.
University's president, William LaForge, said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea."
These are questions which the Lamb will no longer answer.
After leaving the campus, the police later found Lambs track when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner methel Johnson.
His car was still in the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this House, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009, with 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 people, teaching geography and pedagogy.
He holds a PhD in teaching in the spring.
One of his long-time friends, Mr Lambs, called him intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met with shared friends.
They and their friends were in the High School, and he was the cool old guy who tried several years to teach the guitar.
He was the women's chair at the time.
All the girls slept there when they were there, "said hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon inhabitable.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously several times together.
In the emergency call Lamb "I have killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the Backstone house, bordering a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was in order.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who were 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed," said O'Steen on his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard him that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, when he and Abigail were both on a summer-year-market during the last three years.
Later they played together with one or two Gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings their own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a Barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he finished Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night 5 September, after Lamb finished his guitar and mouthharmonikaspiel finished with a slim audience finished with a slim audience.
There was no sign that something was wrong.
"Simply just a happy couple," he said.
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
I think they had both good sense for Scherze.
Schmidt, the "dead professor," directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee.
On Tuesday evening, the Delta State Campus in Cleveland attended about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community at a candlelight commemorative celebration.
Schmidts's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Preservation Watch during the University "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We try to move our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Editor Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that lamb called Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two had ever married.
Toys R Us plan to stop working less for Christmas time.
Toys R Us say that there will not be so many Christmas-time staff as in last year, but the toy and baby products traders say that they will give the current workforce and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to suspend 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start this month with job interviews and the number of employees from October to December.
During the holidays themselves, Christmas is close, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox shook his "Date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it is gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated gambler and an arch length to be with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time," a documentary about Back to the Future, presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, and director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had its premiere 30 years ago.
"It really is for me," said Spielberg, "uncontroversial the greatest journey through time film ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
A boss says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's reinforced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five years of conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that it plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Britain, and France - at the margins of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this unmanageable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in overcoming the crisis in Syria, which they have demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll numbers showing that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to destroy him as a flop.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But, no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper ranks in polls, it has not worked (yet).
Ten out of the last eleven national polls, Donald Trump has shown a double-digit range, and some are beginning to wonder what it means for the chances of the nomination of Real Estate.
Of course it is still too early in the parliamentary term.
No one is claiming that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at this time in 2011, Rick Perrys's leadership was taken to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom even won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsiders "groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth, now recognize Trump's longevity and begin to let go of dollars to topple him.
Here are some recent survey figures indicating that the real estate Mogul is not just a temporary stage:
Trump's popularity ratings have rotated by 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll of the Monmouth-University showed that only two of ten Republicans saw the Real Estate Mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now, six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in the early stages.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60% of Republicans have a good view of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voter GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a poll of CNN / ORC last week, 67% of the Republicans said they would either be "enthusiastic" or "happy" when Trump was nominated.
Only two of ten say they would be "angry" if they were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would "enthuse about 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next thing about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other side, 47% of Republican voters say that they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republican sees Trump temperament not as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters, who said to the Republicans, believe that the real estate Mogul has the right temperament for a president, such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure is true in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a Commander-in-Chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44% think that he did not have the personality to carry out his post effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, such as ABC / Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When they sit down their wrangling, Republican voters hold Trump for real.
If they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, after a poll of CNN / ORC from last week four of ten that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since when four out of ten at the end of July put their money to Yeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters had no crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, a large number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump almost beats everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll of the Monmouth University early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will reap the majority support.
He has before Carly Fiorina 13 points lead, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Yeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have formed their minds.
A new poll by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the electorate who support Trump say that they have won their votes.
Of course, much can be done to change this, and no one can really say never to change opinion.
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment the other outsider, the Neurochirurg Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their minds, are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the subject of immigration.
Since Donald Trump was a "rapist" called "rapist" two months ago from Mexico, immigration is central to the public discourse of 2016.
Some are worried that the bombastic expressions of Trump are going to take away from the Republican Party by the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But, according to the new ABC / Post poll of Monday, six out of ten Republicans say that they agree with Trump on issues of immigration.
So, as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing too.
Frustration with the government is spreading to new highs.
Donald Trump, and Ben Carson, is now losing roughly half of the support of Republican voters, particularly through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll of ABC / Post, they would rather want to be a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A survey by the Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellish anger."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in Hobookenweg you will find the most expensive residential urbanization with views over the North Sea Coast.
In the street, one square meter of a real estate house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is, by definition, limited," said it in the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square metre is the most expensive.
Of course, EUR 18.70 per square metre for a student bude in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top dreams, one of the prizes will be available like peanuts.
The real estate agency Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German locations - with square meters at a staggering height.
There are several tens of thousands of Euro per square metre.
But well, who can afford to be...
Please note that, for once, Munich is not at the forefront.
Champions League: Bavaria's Dream start thanks to Müller and Götze.
Two-legged goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bavaria-star Thomas Müller has simply run a race.
A happy match of Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to make a 3: 0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran '.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
The world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start into the "Mission Milan."
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their battle game in the Champions League in the Greek Record Master Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to the Double-2 / 90th + 2 (89th) and Götzth (89th) wins with 3: 0 (0: 0).
The twelfth start-up in the series is the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016, in Italy, where Guardiola will finally get to Munich for the third round.
In his 28 entries in the Champions League for Bavaria, he received his best support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who had passed a shot of the world champion as a flanking.
"We will not underestimate them," Bavaria's captain Philipp Lahm promised before the match in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and Munich kept its word.
They showed a concentrated and engaged imagination without having to shine.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home matches in the premier class, including Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In the meantime, Borussia Dortmund (1: 3) is one of the pioneers in Borussia Dortmund (1: 3).
But the Bavaria, seven Europacup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They fought courageously, but often to be creative in their offensive efforts.
The attacks have been taken too many times over the outside Douglas Costa, who had rarely gone through the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck on the right hand than his flank from the right half-field on the left upper gate.
At the 67th minute the world champion had the chance 2: 0.
The best opportunities in half one had been Robert Lewandowski.
First, as Olympiakos-Stürmer Ideye Brown shot the head ball of Poland (26).
Then directly, the goalkeeper Roberto with his knees (35).
Although the Bavaria raised its usual dominant game, Piraeus was one of the founders.
On Torguard Manuel New, however, he was abbot.
For example, when he shot a shot of Ideye over the bar (56th).
Before New, Guardiola had a four-seater team with David Alaba in the centre alongside Jerome Boateng, who made it good.
Mario Götze, after musculent problems returned to the cadres, initially sat out.
The World Cup hero has given the green light only after the final exam, "Matthias Sammer said at" Sky ":" Whoever wants to make something different is already malicious. "
During the first change, Guardiola was also opposed to him, when he brought Kingsley Coman to the battered Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, and by Elfmeter, Müller still put up with it.
Before the match it was in the stadium to match.
After a smaller group of partially encircled Bavarian fans appeared to be provoked by the host of Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces began to attack the security forces and went out with swings against the Munich supporters.
At least a Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
Who smoke, has a higher risk of losing teeth
If you smoke, it damages not only the lungs, but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study.
Good news: If no-one loses the risk, the risk will be fast.
Smokers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early on.
This is due to the long-term study of an international research team, including several of the employees of the German Institute of Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In comparison to non-smokers, smokers have the risk of prematurely losing their teeth in order to increase between 2.5 and 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had watched over 23,300 participants.
The main causes of dental failure are caries and inflammation of the gum, emphasizes the DIfE.
For these parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, emphasize authors.
Therefore, the link between smoking and tooth loss results in more frequent gum infections in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking is also increasing the risk of caries.
People who died up with smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research."
However, it could take more than ten years to bring back to the level of non-smokers, Erstautor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
People need to be persuaded to become a non-smoking, the study leader, Heiner Boeing from the DIFE, said: "Smoking reduces life."
Not smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, in accordance with our findings, also leads to good dental health to the old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65-74 was affected by toothlessness, shared the DIfE.
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remnants of the Late Antiquity in Cologne.
For the repeated time, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German-museum skeleton and remains of historic buildings were excavated by Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for the so-called 'Ground Monuments'.
In all building projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always taken care of as a specialist for archaeological site preservation.
In the third part of the Rhine Triangle, the archaeologists have now found it.
From text documents it was already known that in the 4th century there was a fortress and a church in the 8th century, explained Trier.
In addition to the ruins of the fortress and the church tower, a graveyard with about 350 graves was also found which was probably part of the church.
Young women in freight trains
After a young woman is unhappy at the station in Geilenkirchen-Linder, the federal police are asking for help from the local police.
At the beginning of Wednesday morning, at about 1.40 p.m., the woman passed from the station building to the end of the railroad track along the track and was captured by a freight train coming from the town of Mönchengladbach.
Through the acquisition of the train, the federal police carried out most of the injuries.
She was hospitalized and taken to hospital by rescue forces.
About the reason for the fact that the young woman is crossing the streets of the young woman is unable to find any information to the officials of the institutions.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents with acoustic perceptions.
In the evening you can walk to the old town of Linderner Railway, brick betterweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information about the origin of the accident can be arranged with the Federal Police Service, which is available 24 hours a day, or any other police station.
EU Commission is proposing a new court in dispute over TTIP.
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free-trade agreement, TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private dispute settlement systems for disputes between groups and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that is in line with the practice of far more traditional courts.
"We want to establish a system that citizens trust," explains the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the moment.
The Swedish Presidency intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade negotiations with the USA.
The German Government announced its support.
Through TTIP, the world's largest free-trade zone will emerge with 800 million people.
In concrete terms, the plans for reforming the current arbitration process specify that the EU states and the United States together will pick up an independent judge for a new investment court.
They should come to the same extent from the EU, the USA and third countries.
It is intended for the first time also a second instance.
It would allow an objection to be made to a sentence.
So far, the parties involved have agreed to arbiter, an appeal against their judgments have not been made.
In the debate over the last few months, it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old ISDS system in fairness and fairness, Mrs Malmström.
In the long term, they want to work according to their own data on an international investment court.
They could then, for example, also resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.
The investor-state arbitration (ISDS) required primarily by large companies is one of the main reasons for the strong resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can step up compensation at the expense of taxpayers, enforce national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first statements, anti-TTIP organizations, such as Campact, described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
Most of all, it has been stressed that it should not apply to the already-negotiated free-trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
The German Minister for Economic Affairs, Matthias Machnig (SPD), described the plans as major progress.
In the reform, the Commission took account of key points made by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration dishes is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The BusinessEurope European company warned that there were too many new rules to restrict the appeal of the economy through too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, could be penalized.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it remains unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been going on since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be already at the end of this year.
This deadline is no longer tenable.
Delicate Folk Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg, Germany.
Eleven years ago, Sufism is sitting on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
In addition to him, a flipchart, to which the timid follower artist recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan, has been recorded.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens presentation.
He tells us about different places he keeps appearing on the map.
Where they were born and where they are there, in their homeland.
Since then, it has been proven to be wonderful creative people.
With the 2003 release and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" appear wisely composed songs, which can be very close to American folk of the late 1960s, but at any time to be able to move on to an opulent opulent.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" would be the first part of a series: Each of the 50 US states should be followed.
However, in 2004 and in the vicinity of the Rhine is already "Seven Swans" and it is a good idea that we have a good deal of expectations.
It is now possible to get up here.
Live meet him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), 2005 appears in 2005.
I would like to thank you for your interest in our website.
The album rises to the American Billboard Charts and is missing in any annual list of influential music media.
Following an extremely productive experiment, he is working on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth sound studio album is still widely orchestrated, but accompanied by programmed sequences or beats, it plays with all kinds of effect and reverb.
Even though the smaller clubs grew up, the stage shows become the colourful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage desia.
At the moment it is part of a five-man band from Germany.
More!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He is also well-known for his work as a "Carrie & Lowell" since March.
Although it is now nearly 2000 guests who sit in their chairs, the Stevens, who is far more likely, returns to privacy and folk.
Without having to say a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians is playing through the richly enriched album.
Listen to the audience: The talk is "opulent" and you can then throw the "plate at the bottom."
First to add an extra, he would like to thank for a modest, acoustic few older songs and then suddenly turns into applause.
Jeremy Corbyns debut at Question Time for Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyns's debut at Question Time to the Prime Minister is eagerly awaited.
The new Labour chair, Jeremy Corbyn, is supposed to make his debut at Question Time to the Prime Minister, and to start with David Cameron for the first time.
Indeed, Corbyn will rise to settle for the first of his six pre-determined questions shortly after noon, and his performance is likely to be carried out by the media and the Labour members close by.
He asked for "less theater and more facts" during this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Corbyns's leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the Tuc meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Chairman's decision to remain in silence on Tuesday during a commemorative celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory-Presidents and is at the centre of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyner's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
A speaker by Mr Corbyn said he had been "in a respectful silence" and he acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air strikes with England."
But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program, he told the Labour president to sing the national anthem "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Corbyns's top team, and they rely on differences in the economy, defense, and foreign policy, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
Mr President, the political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also stalling within Labour, according to Mr Corbyns's comments on the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits.
Corbyn told the Tuc conference that Labour is proposing to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, shadow working and pension minister, said that the party "is" very clear "that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26.000 £to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour president, the David Cameron since he is Tory's boss in the last decade over the Dispatch box in Parliament.
The Labour Chair, who promised a different policy approach, says that he has had "crowd-fed" ideas for questions to Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 ideas.
The Islington North MP has said that Question Time to the Prime Minister is to be confrontational, and that it will refrain from "dexterity" and the squabbling with opponents and instead focus on focusing on serious problems such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow Minister for Economic Affairs, will be represented by him if he does not attend - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also discussed the idea that other Members may take the floor occasionally, and that he has addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he was appointed in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "fiasco," often associated with Question Time's question, but a few years later he admitted that he failed to do so.
Since it was first sent in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister has been regarded as the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, though critics have argued that they have become a caricature and require far-reaching reforms.

Pound rises by accelerating wage growth in the United Kingdom
In parallel with that, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller's prayer goal.
Between May and July, the result grew by 2.9% in the UK by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage has been the fastest, since 2009, at the point of an increase in interest rates.
The pound increased by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505, and was up to 0.84% compared to the euro to 1.3730 €.
The FTSE 100 index was 1.49% to 6.229.21.
Mr President, Mr Miller was the outstanding figure on the market and made a jump of 20%, after taking over the takeover offer of the rival AB Ingren.
A deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world and combine brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were, after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont 0.9% higher.
Richemonts's latest sales pay all expectations and also showed that turnover in China - a key market for Burberry - reports growth again.
Shares of Glencore grew by 5% after the Bergbauriese said that he took USD 2.5 billion by selling a stock as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper company of Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a 4.1% drop after Goldman Sachs had set up his valuation for the company rating to "sell."
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the 6-million-year-old sportswear company had reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million.
The leader of JD Sports states that higher wages jeopardise expansion.
The CEO of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power" in the pockets of potential customers. "
But it is unlikely that purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs of his firm, he says.
The costs could affect JD sport's expansion plans, he added, and that could mean fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the Capital: On Bieber-Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Smiling 21 years old, an armchair with a top end.
The type with the platinblon hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than that.
Currently Monsieur Bieber in Berlin.
And the generation of U17 turns.
How Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name of the Ritz Carlton.
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
At the end of the morning, the Polish-style hotel is sitting on the Potsdamer Platz square in Berlin.
The bending construction: Here you live your idol, whose posters hang on in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs exactly as much a day as their mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If anything.
The saying goes: "I really should sit in the tenth class in the secondary school."
"I fulfill it a dream."
Compulsory training?
Who is itching?
The fans are not.
Even swimmers do not.
That has been done anyway.
For advertising in the promotional break of the superpot he has gathered three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company dishwasher many, many dollars to the bending over.
And with every doll that looks like he or she goes over the shop, the bending is also won.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you are amazed at the window window.
More than 100 million is supposed to have extracted it.
Some say that the hype is going too far.
In the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?" At first.
Even though the fourth album is to be followed in November, the many zeros do not interest the many zeros.
At the very least, he does.
Pegida-poster brings Lebanon to potato döner idea
Potatoes or Döner?
It works both - in the potato döner, which the Oldenburger snack-maker Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alham potato and meat put together on a table.
On the idea he brought him a poster for an Pegarian demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of Döner," which he had seen on television.
Since then, his shop has turned into a barbecue grill with meat and potatoes.
"That is Multikulti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been set up by the German Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the authority, it has been protected for a while now as a utility model.
As much meat and as much of the henchmen contains, Alhay does not want to betray.
Just as much: "It tastes better," he finds.
At its clients, too, culinary international understanding is good.
Metcash starts the grounding campaign to fight Aldi- Einfall
Metcash tries to protect IGA's stores from an Aldi show in South Australia and Western Australia.
In order to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a 700 million $15m of invasion, Metcash is launching a ground-breaking campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia.
During Aldi's opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media, as well as on events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as iron manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes in IGA stores samples and store owners who sell approved tickets to the South Australian football league to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholesale trader for food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investment strategy day.
There is a lot at stake because South Australia and Western Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metcashs IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia, compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that, twelve months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will pick up about five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all the existing players, but mainly single traders.
According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley has estimated that IGA retailers could lose 360 $million per year and Metp $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in every market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Metcashs's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash some $13 million profit before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metanza loses market share in the eastern states, mostly on Aldi and Coles, although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley is assuming that Metcashs's sales in food and food operations will decrease by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, was the founder of the Magellan Financial Group.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Douglass.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash was contacted by Mr Douglass last week.
GAS has declined since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenues from Metcashs food and food trading, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational deleveraging at the same time as printing on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is investing more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolvorths with hundreds of products each week to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through fast-growing fresh food, and to deliver a better range of private label food.
Metcashs's chief executive, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and loading rehabilitation programs will be on the move, and hopes that, for the first time in four years, the major traders will return to earnings growth for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis Federation Steve Healy.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for its behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick III and, according to the President of the Australian tennis federation Steve Healy deserves praise for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented Duos, which is constantly referred to as "Special Ks," came to the fore with the infamous clash of Tanzania with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent had to be separated by the referee twice by the referee.
While he was last seen as he smashed a tennis racquet, after a crack-break a potential US open victory of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis von Healy was steadfastly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth to be the second in the solo behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup semi-final against the United Kingdom.
"One thing about which I am quite busy is the fact that according to my opinion Thanasi a little was dragged into the quarrel," said Healy.
He has broken a racquet than he lost because of an explosion in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player to have broken a racquet out of frustration with herself, and I know Thanasi good enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think that he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I believe he has been treated somewhat too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year old, he is working very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he has never had a problem with the other players, he has never had a problem with the other players, he has never had a problem with the other players, he has never had a problem with the other players, he has never had a problem with the other players, he has never had a problem with the other players, he has never had a problem with the other players, he does not have a problem with the other players, he does not have a problem with the other players, he does not have a problem with the other players, he does not have a problem with the other players, he does not have a problem with the other players, he does not have a problem with the other players, he does not have a problem with the other players, he does not have a problem with the other
Healy also supported the decision to refrain from taking into account, for the important pre-decision on Friday, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term permanent component in the team as a long-term permanent component in the team. "
"First, we want the team to be concentrated entirely on competition and not on all the controversies around [III]," said Healy.
I think that Nick was quick to climb the climb, which people like Federer and Murray pointed out, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions, some time outside the ramp, in which he can only think about it, and it is best for the team and it is best for him and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declared a state of emergency, closing the border, imprisoning refugees.
Hungary declared a state of emergency and concluded the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all of its attempts to enter the country illegally, with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border, when hundreds of migrants were involved in a no man's land, and Serbian officials were bailed out.
The people who had fled from violence, set aside for an unknown period in a land strip in the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled down there.
But frustrations rose.
As a police helicopter hovering over them, the migrants "open the border!" And shouted insults against the Hungarian standby police.
Some marked out from protest food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister declared that it was' unacceptable 'to send migrants from Hungary, while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border, a day after the 28-nation bloc, did not agree to a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40 000 people, seeking refuge in Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached with EU states receiving another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit on Tuesday on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, does not have its hopes for an early action from Brussels or from its neighbours.
On Tuesday's emergency in two southern regions, there were more powers to deal with the crisis so that they were able to stop streets and to speed up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs Peter Szijjarard, meanwhile, has said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire along his border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants - having ended a fence along the Serb border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison guards were used during the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the next economic migrants who are in search of a better life and not of war refugees who are entitled to protection are strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the shameful of the 4-metre (13 feet) high fence, which the government gave to Serbia along the southern border with Serbia, is a crime, and a higher prison sentence for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares the state of emergency," said government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say very clearly that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still needs to agree with the military, which is expected next week, but reporters of Associated Press have already seen the border with heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days already.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Adviser for Orban, said that there were 45 people trying to cross the border with 45 people, 15 others went deeper into the country.
They come over by destroying the fence, and they are now accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian civil servants also joined two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train trolley with barbed wire to close the borders had arrived.
Chaos surrounds the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal-container to edit data from people and put a crowd in crowds to get there.
About twenty of them were able to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's head over Bernie Sanders in national poll halved.
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-handed edge in the democratic race for his nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her opposite ground.
Clinton has now supported 47% of Democratic voters in the pre-election (58% before), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (rising by 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency, receives support of 15 percent of the pre-election's democratic voters.
More than five months before the first elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed, which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost a range of demographic groups, while Sanders has won.
Clinton keeps a big head of women and moderates, but these advances have reduced.
Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only back to five points here.
Clinton's advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and they and Sanders are now equal.
Clinton, however, still has a big advantage over the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with a dual head start with the liberals, but Sanders is now a five-point head in that group.
About half of the pre-election's democratic voters say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations, and another 15% would only support them because they are the candidate.
Six per cent would not support them.
Not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are mainly enthusiastic about it.
The views are more mixed with those who do not support Clinton; only one quarter would support them enthusiastically.
While 48% of the pre-election's democratic voters say that they enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say this through their leaders Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's supporters are asked for an open question, why they want the candidate is the most common answer that they have the right experience (16%), followed by the view that it is time to have a woman president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Of Clinton's supporters, they also mentioned their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with the problems and eligibility are also quoted.
As the Vice-president casts a potential for the presidency, 57 percent of the preelection's democratic voters would like to see him in the race - though a third believe that he should not do it.
If democratic voters are asked for the pre-election, who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
From Clinton's supporters, more than half are saying that Biden's second choice is far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden is not to be nominated for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton increases with Chávez's lead, from 20 points with biden to the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic electorate sees Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning, but that figure of 78% last month fell.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that views him as the most "most" in the world has risen.
Nevertheless, with regard to the question of what is more important to a candidate, the democratic electorate is asking questions about eligibility.
Similarly, as in the past month, not one democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters stands out as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidate or potential candidate provides good results on some important characteristics with voters in the pre-election of its party.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership.
Biden's three candidates best score with honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion on him.
Democratic voters in the preliminary elections generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in tune with their views.
For all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address, and a server during the term of office as Secretary of State continue to be the Secretary of State, most Democratic voters of the pre-election are content with their statement on the matter and say that it has not influenced their views as a whole.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with their statement, while only about one third is satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on Clinton's general opinions, even though 36% said that their opinion has worsened.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of ten who say that Clinton's view has been worse.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and trustworthy by the voters of his party, it remains a problem for her voters as a whole: Only 32% see it as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of eligible voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the electorate's electorates face Trump rather than honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good marks at leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson, and Bush are best served with honesty.
A majority sees Sanders as being more honest, but as with Carson, many do not have the opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves to a nationwide poll near Donald Trump.
Ben Carson is in the latest poll of CBS News / New York Times tight behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now account for half of the voters "support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters will continue to support Trump nationwide, with the support of 23% in the last CBS poll held before Fox News last month by 27% in the Tuesday's poll.
But Carson shot in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also revealed that Carson is good for demographic groups and Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is down with Wisconges governor Scott Walker who is at the deepest level, with 10% support last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Yeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in 3rd place with 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is Plus or Minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey, which was published last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls - it ends with 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump, with 32% support.
The recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump well before Carson.
With a view to last week's rising carson, Trump found some side engravings for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Pleasant bath temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is now up to 29 degrees warm.
Even though peak values can only be measured in a distance, a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing holidaymakers is enough to find warm water.
A bath in the North or the Baltic Sea should be a short time with a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people no longer go into the sea: A maximum of 18 degrees has the same water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week (DWD).
Bath temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: In the east, there is even up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic, it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes up to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College newcomer
Almost two years after a student dies as a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, when a student passed a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Deng during an introductory session in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital, which contributed to his death, divided the police.
Officials said that he was burdened with their eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng then complained about headaches, then he was unconscious unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call the number of 911 911, after Deng was impotent and waiting for an hour before they brought him to hospital, so the police.
However, they had time to change Dengs clothing, their symptoms were goocs and Andy Meng, contacting the national presidents of the Brotherhood to contact the Council, to seek advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide and set the welfare of the brotherhood essentially on that of Michael Deng," said police captain Wagner.
He could not be resurrected, and he died next morning on his injuries.
After an autopsy report, the latter were repeatedly dealt with in blunt terms against the head, trunk, and thighs.
Many families have been destroyed by harassment of the Brotherhood, and at least one student has been dying since 1970 a year, "said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents the Dengs family.
Wars and their members must be called to account, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury recommended an indictment of Morder third grade for the first five members.
Thirty-three members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also indicted for oppressive attacks and the creation of a criminal association.
"We do not only want to blame the parties involved, but if there is an organisation which, officially or unofficial, has sanctioned this, we will also take them to account," said Wagner, at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national Brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
An interest-rate hike will come, and the home will fall into turmoil, returns on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long this will last and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession occurred within only 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness when raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, US central banks have argued so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start to raise interest rates, but rather to the period that is needed for normalization.
Indeed, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market participants will find that all the excitement is likely to be exaggerated because of an interest rate hike.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a notice to customers.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still to low levels to lead to seismic shock, which many seem to fear.
That does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here a historical trend is based on how some sectors of the economy could react:
As the market saw last month, moving interest rates could be volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that assets 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be corrected, which may reflect the delay in terms of monetary policy," said Deutsche-Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens after interest rates of the Fed.
More specifically, the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent in the last 35 years - on the way to increase interest rates, fairly flat in the 250 days (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average return on the last six previous cycles of 14.4 percent according to an up-to-date analysis, the Bob Doll, Chef Facility-Stratege at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's published.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the harvesting cycle, and that returns are beginning to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often support interest-rate hikes.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is remarkable that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in raising the Fed's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, since 1950 only double nominal GDP has been less than 4.5% since 1950.
Although the second quarter was 3.6% in 2015, few expect this to continue, and, according to the Atlanta Fed, expected only 1.5% for the third quarter.
Interest-rate hikes in such a fragile economic landscape could be risky and raise the question "whether this time is different," said the Deutsche Bank.
Participants have taken the Fed's interest rate all year, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading accounts for only 25%.
"In our study, all the life cycles of 1950 to this day took place in a super cycle with an increasing momentum in GDP, and pre-recession soared after the beginning of recovery," said the report.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the period observed.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and that is now 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipated an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic direction.
On bonds, returns will appear to switch as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place.
At the end of the rise cycle, the bond yields fall immediately, said the Deutsche Bank.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will mean that returns between longer and shorter bonds will come closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-rise bonds often yield better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious about expecting higher returns," said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income analyst in Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, says Jones, that markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflationary expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy" wrote it.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the income curve has expanded, and volatility has expanded, and volatility has increased - all the features of the market if the Fed intensifies its strategy.
On the whole, companies that handle the greater part of their operations in the US will benefit from raising interest rates and making local products more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off, with rising dollars making their products more expensive on the global market, as well as financing their debts.
"History shows that" quality "shares tend to respond positively to three months after an initial hike hike," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
With a strong balance sheet, companies with a low record of interest rates increased by five percentage points after each year, in 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high levels of capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their counterparts with lower quality per 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) on average.
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will most lose the most, Goldman said.
Beyond mere equity games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher yields, even if experts disagree about how quickly that will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MPs Andrew Bingham.
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the channel for its "ducking"
He argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also directed to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitate The Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "converts to Classic FM," says a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he is doing something that the private sender does not do.
The Conservative Member, Andrew Bingham, also mentioned the BBC Bossen that the public service radio is "stupid" and increasingly no longer to be distinguished from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word" stupid "- but it seems to turn to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be The Brits only under a different name.
So if you try to do something else - this is two spontaneous examples where you actually only imitate what is already on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director-General dismissed the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is flying well before his commercial rivals when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learned from Radio 3 that I'm not going to learn more about classical music anywhere.
And there is a commitment to live music and music, which is truly unmatched.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works, I think really is important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work needs to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British were less familiar with classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only item of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee for selecting culture, media, and sport to put commercial rivals on their feet.
The Tory MP Damien Collins took the voice of the BBC's musical talent show, bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and does not particularly mark the mark?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "on a special BBC way."
He added that he would like to see the company "a hit from our in-house stable," when the next time he starts a series of entertainment.
However, he refused to rule out the order of other ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend the money of the installers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased in August and the Black Friday may be responsible for it.
In the first three months of 2015, there were seven percent of sales in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest since the records began in 2000.
Online sales increased three years through the use of mobile phones for shopping.
Experts believe that the black Friday in November slowed down expenditure
For more than a decade virtual merchandise has been bent, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are now signs that online transactions are stagnant, as new numbers showed just 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total spending for August represented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent higher than the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnant after new numbers showed only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you consider the growth rates for the years to come and go back to 2000, then it has always evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began to make purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments, for example, at home on the sofa.
But this is now a step forward and we may well see that growth is reduced.
The Black-Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as one reason for diminishing sales.
Experts believe that buyers will withhold their purchases from this event, which will be held on last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers about their computers to make their bargains, and some retailer sites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers are fighting for bargains, would like to discourage purchasers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that 5 £spending was spent over 1 £online.
With some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims are buried in Mecca at the Kran accident - Bin Laden's family is being sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead will be borne by Muslims at first time in Mecca through the streets.
Saudi Arabia exposes the collapse in part of the huge Saudian Bin Laden group on the load.
The Ministry of Health said that also a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed on Mekkas Großmoschee.
Vacillaries, mostly dressed in white, the stretch to pay their respects when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al-Moigny graveyard.
The ceremony of mourning was passed on to the Holy See, where only days before there was a building cron through the ceiling of the mosque and then the king.
The corpses were released for funeral, when the Saudi king over the family Bin Laden construction company, who left 394 injured, imposed a sanction.
The corpses of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Park Mekka were worn through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, the father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage to the Kran.
Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the year.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Haddsch to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city will continue.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin Laden Group should not leave the crane as it was not being used.
An Arab version of the decree issued by the State's Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency reported this detail, but said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman had promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the Great Moschee, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsch, who later this month, gathered together.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued statements on the collapse of cranes, and its representatives have not been available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also did not engage the group with current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mekkas Großmoschee as part of the massive construction project that is led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected with the Saudi Arabia family for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a retired son who was expropriated by the family in 1990's.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials ordered that one million Rial (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of displaced persons and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured are half of this amount.
B & Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over!
British employ an increasing number of tradesmen, Veronique Laury says.
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has seen a rise in growth.
This leads to the fact that 200 more screwfix stores, focusing on craftsmen, will be opened up.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide.
From Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes.
If you are clever with a hammer or a brush to remove walls, you seem to be a minority today.
As British employ an increasing number of tradesmen to carry home-work jobs in their homes, so the boss of the company behind b & Q.
Véronique Laury, new leader of Kingfisher, who owns the building market chain, said that a big increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who have offered services at low prices is now obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more screwfix shops, serving craftsmen and 60 points of sale from B & Q.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten buying decisions are taken in the store by women.
At the moment, the men are standing up for the men.
She said that it was necessary to rise to the growing demographic trends, which have more female single households, making more renovations than they were in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men in our stores.
We must move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on purchasing items through women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, which is one of only five women at the head of a British company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its executive and financial director.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious choice - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in the half-year gain and the turnover after the group taught the costs of closing the shops.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new stores.
Civil servants of Aich / Dob due to infidelity to court
On Wednesday, at the Regional Court of Klagenfurt, two of the two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-runner Aich / Dob will have to be responsible for infidelity and deposit education.
The defendants were not guilty of that.
One of them was also accused of abuse of power.
From that point of view, he has been acquitted legally in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Supreme Attorney-General Robert Ripper, the preliminary study has crystallized that, in the years 2006 to 2011, the defendants used funds from club accounts, which they were allowed to distribute in their functions, for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at approximately 400,000 euros.
The sports functionaries are also accused of financial offences.
This fact leaves the chairperson of the Schopenensenats, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
To the death of the Unfaithful, the defense was that the association was not included at any time of an investment.
The sports equipment would only have been charged expenses and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011, and in which they had invested a great deal of time and money from the debts - the passva fraud in 2001 was about 600,000 Schilling (roughly 44.000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: Will we continue or close the club," said one of the accused, in the bread profession, the financial office.
With his colleague and co-accused, he then decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have made money out there, our life assurance as security at the bank," he said.
The Association has been agreed: You can freely manage the money, no debts can be made.
In addition, in case of an adequate financial success, the payout of allowances has been decided retroactively until 1991.
For that reason, a portion of the allowances would be paid only years later, in 2003, as a plus on the account.
As a result, the former Obmann also seemed to be talking about a package tour rather than any detail, explaining what's going on.
The accounts and savings books have combined the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
If the payouts were not disclosed in detail, the judge asked.
The association did not care in detail for financial management; it was important to have only debt freedom, so the answer.
An amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the club's account in 2011.
They said that they would have been back, declared the accused.
This securities account ran into the name of the second accused, and according to the Association was not aware of it.
"Why?" Wanted to know the judge.
The survey told us for a long time.
Then he said he believed he was the best for the club.
If it had happened to him, no one would have known this money, the prosecutor in the room.
The co-accused was informed, and the functional figure was justified.
This transfer has been made as "Damage Confirmation."
If she wants to make a claim, he or she would like to know the prosecutor.
That's why he said that he had not agreed to this wording, because the club had never been damaged.
But what should I do if the lawyer says: "With you are all out of the tailer."
"Am I a legal representative?" He asked.
At the same time, he said that he had never paid a cent salary, he only charged Kilometermoney and diets.
At diets he charged the organization 1,000 euros a month, but the actual amount was much higher, he added.
Exact documents for the early years were not available to the accused.
These would no longer be stored after an operating test, in which everything was deemed to be correct, they said.
Mileage allowances also related to the second accused.
He said in his statement that all the authorities were in cash, and he had to go to the bank from his place to come to the Bank to come to the Bank.
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with a survey of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard delivers more than 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reductions that have been going on for three years, the computer giant to break down the company's divisions will reduce further jobs.
The US computer giants Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not see an end.
In the framework of its restructuring, the US-technology group is planning to phase out between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in its company.
This will save about USD 2.7 billion (€2.4 billion), divided the company on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will be due to the fourth quarter.
The dismantling of 55,000 jobs over three years has not been completed.
At the end of fiscal 2013 / 14, HP employed around 302,000 employees.
On the other hand, the Hewlett-Packard share was 2.3 percent.
At the moment, with printers, the Group from California Palo Alto is now moving, so that the computer and printer business will be bundled again this year in a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both business areas are to be listed on the stock exchange.
Once again disappointing PC sales, as well as a weakening demand for company customers after its services, continued to use the second largest PC manufacturer worldwide after Lenovo.
In the third quarter by the end of July, sales of PC and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just $25.4 billion.
In this way, the proceeds were returned to 15 of the 16 quarters.
HP answers with a break-up and massive job references to the industry's transformation.
The 76 year old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman was late to react to customers being increasingly buying smart phones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more businesses online.
Whitman's restructuring plans total a total of 55,000 posts.
Conflicts: Majority support the anti-IS education mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in the war in Iraq would, however, be overwhelmingly opposed: 54% said it was against, 35% was in favor.
The fact that other states are flying against the ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61% positive.
24% are against intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syria's rulers, Baschar al-Assad, would be down to 51% of respondents, and 20% would be in favour.
29 per cent did not decide.
Car: The second day of the day on the 66th IAA
At the centre of the trade fair there are networked, self-sustaining cars and electromobility until 27 September.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Mobility" on Thursday.
The large audience can attend the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA are expected to host the VDA two years ago with about 900 000 visitors.
Röszke: Violence in the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed hundreds of thousands of refugees on the Serb border at Röszke tear gas and water spotters.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind him, a police line was formed, and behind the police he stood for a water cannon.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks, and plastic bottles.
The officers initially set up pepper spray.
Afterwards, the police used tear gas.
Much tear gas has been spilled towards the refugees.
Thus the group was dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn somewhat.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear-water did cry.
Other refugees have joined together and suffered from breathing.
Also the press officer of the Serbian police suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching if the Federal Reserve joins two days on Wednesday and Thursday to take the important decision whether, for the first time since almost a decade, interest rates have been raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half that the Fed would do now that the Fed would do it now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Fed had interest rates on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero-zone and start a process of normalization of interest rates," Angel Ubide said, Chief of Staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively high level of performance, trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet, generating low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook of global relations.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday?
Death guard at the Delta State University left debt forgiveness.
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later grew up his colleagues later on a day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was "sorry" for the first murder and wanted to make it unheard, "he could do it unheeded," said authorities on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University, called the emergency call number against 10: 00 am Monday morning.
And said, he had shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police had to send police policemen to his home.
He said, "I raised my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one is going to bother," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller on his behalf, but he did not give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
As police the scene betrat, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a hand-written note of Lamb, 45 who said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman I ever loved. "
Following the letter of the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as a policeman murdering him.
University's president, William LaForge, said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, said authorities on Tuesday, said "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said about seven years old, described as a "good man."
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said, he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and they were "on the ground."
He said that Prentiss was the daughter of his daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online at home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, had met with Lamb for about three years.
"She wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police said, Lamb gave relatives at a specific point on Monday to tell them "he is not going to jail."
When police took him upon Highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled to foot, ran into the forest, and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb was awarded a doctorate by the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 as his life's life in the university's website.
Stars that have lost their fortune-keepers
The actor (left), in the image with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, due to cancer.
The actor has also allegedly fought to fight drugs, and in 2008 it was condemned by drug owners.
All of this certainly takes its toll.
Eurovings: Lufthansa builds the Group on behalf of the Group.
The Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save itself with a better organisation.
150 of the worldwide about 1000 executives will cost the Group's restructuring the job.
With the pilot union, there are, however, new negotiations.
Lufthansa builds up its corporate structure and evaluates its low-cost Eurowings.
Target of rebalancing is a result contribution of around 500 million euros a year from costs and recoveries, divided the airline on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa is no longer a member of the board for passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the board team, Mr. Carsten Spohr will be responsible for Eurowings in future.
With the new creation, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organisation of the 120 000 employees of a strong company has been complex.
The airlines were operating under the umbrella of the airline group, which represents the three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective conflict with the pilot's cockpit (VC), the negotiations will resume after the court-led strike on this Thursday.
That was divided by the union.
The subject of talks is intended to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
In a year's time with a projected record result, the aim is to be able to produce strong results as quickly as possible.
The conflict between the unions and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
Background is the savings concept "Wings" in addition to the pilots "transitional supply.
It seems that Lufthansa's fight against competitors is being sold to the Group's own low-cost line Eurowings.
Under the title "Morgenzug in the south," paintings from Leena Krueger can be seen in the artist's house.
For a long time in Göttingen, Finin has assembled a selection of titles from the white room in the house, which animate their viewers to go on journey.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months due to double fractures.
With the Champions League defeat at Manchester, Shaw Shaw suffered a double fracturing of his right margin.
While this will bring the left hand over to the outside world and exclude him for at least six months from play, Louis van Gaal does not believe that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had fallen into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg area and is in hospital."
It will be moved tomorrow, or perhaps a day later, and then operated in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it is very hard, and then it is fantastic, and then it happens.
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double set, it takes six months, and it will not play during the group phase.
I hope that he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of an elm meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexicans.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an Elfmeter and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack with both feet.
A tweet on Shaws's account was: "I would like to thank you all for your news.
As a result, Manchester United has suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at the PSV (PSV).
The British defender, with the European Cup, has an additional incentive to recover from the coming June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It is a very bad injury."
When a player leaves space with this type of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to violate an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He is doing very hard because it was not his intention to violate the opponent, and when you hear that it is a very bad injury is not good," said Cocu.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction, so it looked as though he had touched him [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6 said, Moreno: "I know how to feel it, I know how difficult it can be.
I am very sorry, but I am so sorry.
The PSV-Player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a Foulplay by Chris Smalling.
I am sure that David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It's a thing that all parents will learn soon: If your child likes a book, it will not last until you know it almost.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to call his favourite child book, the prime minister decided for The Lorax, the 1998 eco-label of Dr. Seuss.
It was a tough choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I would like to read out to my children, because it seems that there is always a picture or a message that we have already missed."
All well and good, except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book, instead represents a summary of the 2012 movie that added to the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the heart of Audrey, the heart of Audrey, the heart of Audrey, the heart of Audrey, the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, to the heart of Audrey, the heart of
As though it were not suspicious enough, the Cameron submitted text reads in part as the summing up of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database, and so begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams".
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, Cameron seems unlikely to be familiar with the storyline of the book; here, an unnamed boy, who remembers the local environment, is devastated by the name-rich Lorax, a hock-loving creature, which is going on in the name of the trees, by the name-holder Lorax, a hock-loving creature "standing in the name of trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read the Lorax for 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron's electoral district office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron's employees was delivered, but there were no further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England's team, but it is still hard to see it.
To face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the Kader, the England for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my card.
I would not rule out victory.
Alastair Cooks page is probably less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin-players in the Batting's listing, and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear scars from 2012, only a young, positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali is developing as a Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown level at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related news: Adam Lyth leaves from the England-Test-Kader and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, as his head teacher in Yorkshire, difficult to analyze.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are aligned with results.
There were no question marks for Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I said earlier - players are their own best selection.
A long time ago, the course of Lyth had been extended, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he hope to go out of his way out to Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform such good performances, and this does not surprise me; he is mainly a team man.
The question how much time a test shot is received to place his character is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him -, while Nick Compton 9 was given.
Only Compton got the chance to play back and forth.
The only criticism that can be raised was that England first came to bear Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was at maximum - but this lost opportunity is now past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a drummer whom I highly appreciate.
He is an X-Factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire earlier this season, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge square, which was very much to us.
He must have at least the same opportunities as before him, but that does, of course, depend on his team presence in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to leave Moeen next to Cook, which would make an extra spin bowling and get four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a drummer cannot beat there, and these left-wing parties have already shown that he is a circle of cricket players.
Moeen may have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
My former team mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he first appeared in 2001.
He finished three hundred meters and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the hands as the back-up-spinner, and in my limited approach to him he has impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - an average of 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there are no large number of backup spins that make their hands and coaches have chosen for young people.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England made some clever additions to the trainee.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as consultant for the test games could be a master-coup.
He is one of the most nettable guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience, since he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and power to the setup.
I always felt that he has been created for international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes, new votes can bring fresh air in the dressing room, even if the news is in line with what previously said.
Team mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, will not be used at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break with Australia, and I personally do not have a problem with it.
Some may not agree, but coaches and team drivers do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
Brexit's Brexit (Brexit = Exit Britain from the EU) could gain in gains if the economy were to be in the throes by 2017.
David Cameron's unsightly renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy, "Yes or no?" Corbyn to the Labour or the Tuc who fought hard on Tuesday for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some member states are so deeply entangled in various crises, as the EU is now, and not always on its own fault, that Britain's own-made agenda with split concessions and disturbing treaty changes, which they mostly do not want, are fed up.
In Brighton, the Tuc on its annual meeting decided that it would not even jeopardise social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie-Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a photo of yourself before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, come home and say that they gain allies for reform.
It is always a question of me.
My European friend, who wants a outward looking Britain inside the EU tent, "tells us not only with France," says Berlin - and let us see more and more short-sighted ministers and civil servants reaching to the point where they do not matter to them, whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautious leader, Angela Merkel, is a ally, but she has been in power for 10 years, and wants to leave, before it looks bad for her, as it did for the overlong, like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14), and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks back on his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
It is also a legal force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain left a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will tear themselves out of a leg to help the Selfie-British, whose energy should be better used to escape from the UK's exit from the UK - something they don't want to do, because most of them have a similar separatist tendencies.
As a result, some of these ministers may even consider not helpful comments, in the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process is suspected by my friend.
"The renegotiation was a default" and "the United Kingdom has won no value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be on its expense, and which EU skeptics is the oligarchy of the Pressebarone as it was during the referendum in 1975, which was inspired by Tony Benn, but who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
You can be weak at Boris Johnson, the Erz-euro opportunist who made a name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his nipples, Ed Miliband knew who was his enemies.
That includes the Medley of tax-loving villains, phone-hacked foreigners and the pseudo-non-countries that hold most of our great newspapers.
Indeed, Tony Blair thought similar to her, but he noted that, when sitting with a hot Gorilla in a cage, they were selling better bananas to divert him rather than his lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blair than Blair himself, when he resisted Cameron's referendum, because Blair had the principle of the unadopted constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a back door.
The press never dragged him on to him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who gave me a warm hug on Monday at Westminster - I told him that he doesn't have to waste any time for me - seems to be in danger, Neil Kinnocks boycott Murdoch's strategy of 80 years, a mistake then and today.
It may take, but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC-sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns's official position is - I speak it friendly - in development.
He says that we should stick to a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukips traditional Blaufarbstoff and the wild nature of Torys's small-nation-ism can say "yes" to everyone.
It is what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week said when the scout was fighting him, not to admit that Corbyns's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70-years when his old father worked on television to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilarys's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain 'in all circumstances' - Benns's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his comrades and members after all the reports on their final meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the delicate bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to communicate - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and, above all, in the Strudel of the Social Media, a nesting place of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for obvious, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns fundamentally ambiguous about EU membership - in line with their Bennite education economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom the Narzisism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguity with NATO - Tom Watson is rock-proof that JC does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplomats will be bound to try to find, in all, a sense of their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have a suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if they are useless?
The US is already rather disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even with a cost-cutting of the Tory government in power, which, at the start of Monday, was reminded of something British influenza Security Forum called.
Experts criticise Public Health England via e-cigarettes
Statements made by a government-financed agency that E-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was created out of a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticising Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "principled report" last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A temporary article in the magazine Lancet last month caused the "extraordinarily windy base" to be based on the PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether they build "on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy."
You said that the public expects that the statement of PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of proofs and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criterion decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to bring their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing directors were supposed to have received from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references from BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to receive money from an e-cigarette producer, but not to add the funding that he should have previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International in advance, adding them.
The reasons for selecting the members of the body will not be supplied, but this includes several familiar E-cigarette champions, some of whom also provide a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in the control of tobacco.
At the meeting, the tobacco management of PHE also took part.
The group's research suggests that there is a lack of "hard evidence of most of the most suitable products" for most products, "McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the allegations of PHE that "there has been no evidence yet that e-cigarettes as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers are" premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director for health and well-being with PHE, said that on the claims of BMJ had already been answered before.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifetime smokers die from their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what constitutes proof and not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers relative to the tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease with a relation to smoking, and smoking is costing the National Health Care $2 billion a year.
By providing clear evidence of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should give up Eastenders, former head of Channel 4 says.
The president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like Eastenders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels.
He criticized the BBC for using public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, to place themselves in tough disputed time frames against the most popular shows of their rivals and channels like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had been trying six years to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent, that would be clearly shown by non-subsidized rivals," Johnson said to the Oberhaus Communication Committee as part of his survey of the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee, which I think is not a good idea in the medium or long term, one should at least try to produce at least the programs that others do not do or do not want to do.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window, because they want to achieve as broad a broad support as possible for their future.
The idea that otherwise nobody would show it is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said, "I do not see why a regressive tax is financed, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, Eastenders is another, admittedly, both proprietary productions.
Frankly, other channels would give them their right arm.
I am trying to see what public service television is supposed to be.
I do not think that this would reduce the BBC altogether.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is to bear on the hunt for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC will give you again what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows like Eastenders should sell.
Johnson said that the rather public-legal niches should go to BBC4, where you could not measure quite the audience, but they meet their duties, and they can argue if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion £radio fees, "Now, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that have seen no one seen '.
They put it in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them.
To broadcast fees, Johnson said the committee: "I call upon you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions to find who can obtain the best value from it.
Of course think all of us, we all think that you will receive a great value for 150 £per year, but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 £a lot, I wonder whether this is true, because they do not consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky- and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also said in front of the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to check its Reithian Mission, "to inform, to educate and to entertain."
He said, only a little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should change in "inform, inform, inform, and entertain" in public service TV channels in Australia and Canada.
On the question of partnerships said Elstein, the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Proms, of whom he said that only a handful of people will be shown on television, and to make alliances with the commercial channels to make all available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves.
The video shows how the Nematodes are changing the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems, which can be controlled by leaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment when they have to be heard with sound pulses, which have to be heard for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work through the activation of Motoneuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels responding to ultrasonic waves.
To read about this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Sonogenetics, which can be used with ultrasound to enable a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Haekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depths brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
They usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasound waves and then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures that are called TRP-4-ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the sausages cells.
The sound waves bring out the opening of these Izone channels and enable the cells to be assigned to them, such as the Nature Communications report.
To create ultrasound guided Nematodes to create, modified Chalasani genetically the worms so that some of their engines carry TRP-4-Izone channels.
If he uses ultrasound on the modified creatures, the sound waves will be amplified through the microbbers and transferred to the worms where they turn on the modified Motoneurons.
The technique has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons with pulses of light on and off.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light sent to an optical fiber to the desired body in the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can penetrate unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the sought-after human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, and added it.

The Paths of Britain's Arms Race
Amnesty International anti-weapons trade fairs video watch.
Terrible murderer drones!
The second half of the first half of the year is the most important thing in the world.
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock, which causes painful pain, but does not leave a trace!
The happy voice and the cartoon images let there be no doubt that this display for the world's largest arms trade is a belligerent parody that Amnesty International has produced to put the British Government's willingness to charge arms to the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands on defense and Security Equipment International Jamboree.

But a separate campaign also leads to lots of posters, which can be seen at bus stops and underground trains, and they require a second glance.
"Important announcement: Go from 15th to 18th September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) you read in the font types of the London Underground and the brands of the DLR line, which turns to the image of a tank.
In September, a bale of arms dealers with DLR will be flying... customers are asked to help stop the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are exhibited by artists exhibited in the Museum of cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped the distribution in London and used the "Ad Space Hack Packs," a 6 £-pack of Inbusclen, of which it is claimed that "access to around one-third of bus advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London this badge "vandalism" does not find fun.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists engage with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go out to the real world out there, so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-arms sales posters greet the pendulum in the underground.
The Amnesty-Video has been viewed on Facebook for more than 100,000 times and was developed by the VCCP advertising agency, the non-profit association with the graphic artist and Voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the stillness that reigned around the campaign for the weapons trade - with the exile of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Let us give them the campaign they try to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising, but "with bright colors and animation, it remains stronger."
"They have made a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices on the exhibition," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are shooting outstanding euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the US Army via "the AT4CS RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped ground head, which provides outstanding retroactive effects inside the target."
Whatever it makes, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, I moved as a self-forgotten 19-year old in a student residence, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now remember the tense smile of those I have been angry with - and to the many, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student residence ranges from easy-to-life to absolutely appalling.
It is tempting to chew: Tell people about where you are coming from, if and where you have taken the Sabbath year, where you are in relation to Corbyn, and why, frankly, Marmite does not love or hate, because in the seriousness of guys, it's just a yeast extract hahaha, I'm in my room. "
Breathe in.
And help others to do the same - posts ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk about, even if your eyes were on fire and these fire extinguishers.
Let people.
The rooms of people are often transformed into drinks, movie-night venues and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people get on with their underwear.
Related to this: Do not think of beginning with a relationship at the university.
Introspection received a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a haven, but many student houses form a space-to-space-stroll, which is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you must go away so I get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a commilitone is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
To knock on: Do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He looked at a few things.
Friendship ties through cheats.
Since you start the university at the height of the back-manie, the Klopfen is on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of Brownies, less weird than the greeting of 1950-er years "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked something, so, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Making delicious treats is a good way to make friends.
They feel obliged to speak, and may ultimately associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly missed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to sleep if you knock on.
To steal is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, eating chicken is a theft, but is it a drop of a drop in your tea?
Check it out with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook.
If someone steals your stuff, it is annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to have a more balanced approach than my fellow-member who added milk to the milk to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
They should not make noise, the people from sleep or work.
It is not just a matter of being a decent person, but that you literally belong to the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbours whether it makes sense to make your ass and bass a little bit more quiet, because they were three o'clock in the morning, and they had an exam in the morning.
They reacted with even more vocal music.
At the end of the day, when they stopped at 5 o, they kindly slept their neighbors for two hours before they threw out their own music, shut down their doors and returned to their three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would come to the same student residence at random?
On the other hand, it would not be abominable if you were a co-resident for your future spouse for your future marriage, getting rid of them again, and then seeing them every day, and perhaps witnessing all shared friends?
Of course, the heart goes his own way - but if a hot fellow-man is definitely not your future marriage partner, try at least trying to try out a bit of good mind.
At the exciting moment you notice that someone else has its keys in its unclosed room, the boundary between an Ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good enough is funny, but it takes only moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Give you a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but don't see anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Shut your door, and put your keys into a glass of water, which you then put into the freezer, but do not check your possessions on the ceiling twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single-parent families, low earners
The real estate manager Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for people who do not have much money.
So, for example, for refugees, but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also their single mothers and low earners."
"I show how we can still be even more favorable and good to build today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees are forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how quickly favorable living space can be created: It is built in a project of terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing for the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or turns does not have sustainability.
For the people remain a large part of it here.
Given the flow of refugees, we also need sufficient housing in the decades to come.
An entirely banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least course.
It facilitates integration.
That is different when building people in blocks of flats.
Each of the six houses that is being built precisely in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it is again peace, I go back.
Then the houses can be easily converted according to their needs.
What is the cost?
Gildner: The price of 160 sqm per house amounts to 184 000 euros, without land.
That is clear.
Six months has taken the construction stage.
That is reasonable.
Have the building rules complicated their plans?
Gildner: I fixed my project correctly.
Especially complicated is the threat of Damocles special construction and the Stellplatz Regulation.
Gruselig.
There is still an indication of who creates three apartments in a terraced house requires at least three pitches.
Only there is a lack of space in the cities.
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What is definitely not true.
But do you not exacerbate competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True, we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years, but built luxury flats, which can hardly afford to go.
My project has the message, and the ordinary people also need space.
Not only refugees, but also single mothers or low earners.
I show how we can still be even more favorable and well-built today.
That is what it is all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem engineering in Regensburg and initially worked with environmental analyses.
Ios 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration app, typing in "General" and selecting "Update software."
If it is ready, you give the phone the option to download and then install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation because they get an error message saying that the "software update" failed.
To avoid the problem, users are recommended to wait either to wait until the onslaught or try to upgrade to iTunes.
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it less likely to delete apps, and it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is in close proximity to a charger, so that the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may be halfway down, and that might lead to an end to the update.
Read: Ios 9 Release still in schedule despite the WatchOS delay in checking of iOS 9: The least exciting, but the best update of iOS 9: How to prepare for the new iPhone operating system.
You should also make sure that you have seen before your download our checklist of all things, to prevent things going wrong and to protect themselves, if they do, iOS 9 brings new functions, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes, speeding up the operating system and repairing the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg is one of the most famous Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1.
The World Cup second emphasized before the launch in the crucial seven overseas races, "that I don't have to lose any more."
53 points separate the vice-champion of Singapore on this sunday of champion and second-hand champion Hamilton.
The Brite has already won seven of the previous twelve season races and is shooting the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state.
2009 and last year the 30 year old Brite could win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state at the Grand Prix of Singapore will have an impact is still unclear.
For days, a dark bell about the city has been hanging, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen" was launched three months ago.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who held more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for treatment.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the Federal Ministry of First Class and honorary citizens of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann has supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation to the president Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot raise the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wants to see membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" as an expression of its affinity with the spa town.
Malaga Estate Office searches for direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined together under the cloak of the social foundation and a new branch of the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, we can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation goes down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new travel office building has recently been opened.
Here, right next to the shopping market, from now on you get up-to-date information on matters such as health insurance or health and nursing care.
For years, our outpatient care service has shown that often caring people are left alone.
There are an endless number of questions.
"Also, many of the benefits of the treasuries are not taken into account, because the complexity of insurance is barely understood," the new housekeeper, Jutta Weigand, who, as a business manager, is responsible for the Antonistift and the citizen hospital, as well as for the ambulant service "Amadeus."
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter also provides prevention, health courses and wellness.
In this respect, the Saludis has been taken on board.
Therefore, additional offers can be used, such as fall prevention, memory training, or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The range of services offered by the seniors' centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The senior center for care and care," Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new travel office in the city centre will include both executives especially in demographic change.
That is why it is essential to have a good, decentralised infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized the inauguration ceremony of the district office, and the district office also dedicates itself to the membership in the old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite to a regular sociable audience."
By doing so, the social foundation makes a big contribution to the fact that seniors can live autonomously and well in their familiar surroundings.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16: 00 to 18: 00 and on Saturdays from 10 am to 12: 00 am.
Eintracht Bamberg vs. Würzburger Kickers on October 6, 2009.
It is official: After renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion for the match-match for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-party "Würzburger Kickers" has not yet been defined, now the 6th of October has been fixed as an appointment.
At the end of the third round of the championship of the Bavarian football "FC Würzburger Kickers" the match is now finally fixed.
It will be held on Tuesday, October 6th, at 19: 00 in the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game will take place on stage, now we have planning certainty," says FCE-Teammanager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points out the ticket sales.
It is special for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore hope to see many spectators, and not without reason, because flood lights have a special charm.
In the final round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg won the Regional Council of FC Oberhaid (3: 1) and at home against the Regional Council of 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3: 2).
The winner of the contest receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Club spokthan 2016 / 2017.

Parking penalty: Tim meadow pounded a policeman with money
Ex-footballer Tim meadow is noticed in Bremen.
At the end of the first half of the 20th century, it was the first time in the United States.
According to his own statement, 30 kg of muscle mass he wants to have accumulated over the last two years.
Intellectually, he has not done so.
In the middle of the city of Bremen, I had to cut the hair when he saw how outside a parking space guard stood out for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
As a result of the business, the official offended the official and blamed her for the penalized fine of his feet, as the "image" newspaper reported.
At the city of Bremen, the accusations are confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not clear.
"The thing is still in the exam," said it from the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether or not to display field, or not.

Men beat the 17-year-old Afghan people
An incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 11.30 p.m., three young men were on foot from Bad Soden to Salmünster.
One out of the group, a 17 years old Afghan, followed, according to the police, followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters and called unto them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft gas station.
There are also three people in the area of the gas station.
One of these men is now shouting to the young and smelling his face.
As a result, the victim suffered a nose break and a strong anemic in the nose.
When his two friends rushed and appeased on the racquet, it first stopped him from his victim.
The last young man was brought home to his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car up to their home and then led the demonstrators several times to go there.
When you no longer saw the vehicle, the injured were in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was once again attacked by the racquet and other male person.
Under the help of a curling it was checked on the face and neck of the victim.
The victim had to be taken to hospital for medical services.
So far, there is only a vague case description.
One of the men was about 1,80 meters tall.
The second racquet should have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and pointers to report under telephone number 06181 / 100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes care of Feldenausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felsenausen.
It is also well-known for Bernd Bormann, an economic support agency Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places on the country, physicians - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: There, Dr. Frank Müller takes the practice on 1 October.
During the Second World War, during the next few months, her husband Karl-Heinrich will continue his successor in the next few months.
After a period of reconstruction, the practice starts again on 12 October, until then, until then, he invests 310000 euros in the premises at St Marcellusstraße 6.
At first sight, it was a pleasure to see Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who, at the moment, took part in the hospital in the hospital.
"We had always in the head that the garbage cans would fit well into this practice," Dr. Ursel Trail says and laughs.
"When it was, I simply called it."
The husband, Mrs Müller, liked the idea of using his own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"Proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and support the families for years."
As an advantage he also sees his own boss as soon as possible.
And so it was agreed that the refuse collection bought the house with practice.
At the same time, they will continue to be at fault-town-Vilsen.
This is where the double family-father Frank Müller grew up, his medizinstudium in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a head physician in Sulingen, and he has been a leading specialist in the field of Diepholz in 2009.
From the 19th of September the practice for the new head will be prepared.
During the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felishausen is working as a house doctor, his wife Ursel is specialized in gastroenterology.
The garbage collection, both of the gay men, want to settle down as house doctors.
"Endoscopy is therefore out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After renovation the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic examinations as well as long-term and endurance "EKGS" and need a room more.
Furthermore, the computer is completely renewed.
A grant of a total of EUR 50 000 will be given to the waste producers as part of a support programme for the district (€25000) and from the Sama community (EUR 12 500) and the municipality (EUR 12 500).
"This shows how proud and glad we are that the practice continues," says Samtard debürator Bernd Bormann.
About 2 000 patients receive a quarter of the practice in the practice Feldenausen, according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, in the north German average practice is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another house doctor's practice.
A positive side effect of the practice taking into account by Frank Müller: The pharmacy will remain in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felsenausen.
If no successor had found it, it would have gone.
For example, if you visit waste hour, you will still be looking for familiar faces: Take care of the seven medical specialists and the cleaning force from the fields.
Their farewell is an era in Asendorf, after all, for 30 years, the doctor practiced there for 30 years.
"At the beginning, we only had two rooms," Ursel Feldenausen remembers.
There is little sorry about it for a long time.
"But we are still living in Hohenmoor and will definitely see many patients still," says the boarding house.
Her husband adds up: "We have a 6000 square square."
"So far, I have always pressed for gardening, now it could be changed."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and travels.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees through"
'Now border controls are also going on at our southern border, "said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls on the Hungarian border are continuing in parallel.
It is still clear that everyone who wants to apply for asylum can also be able to do so 'of course'.
The supply and safety of the people are at the forefront.
But it is also clear that there is a need for clear signals, "said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept limitless migratory flows, even in the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is currently considering the "Corridor" - Slovenia refused.
The Croatian Government had previously said that Slovenia also wanted to travel to the following refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany, and may also establish corridors for refugees.
That was the case, Mr Vesna Györkös Znidar, however, did not.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," but Slovenia will intensify the surveillance of the border - especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia is already heavily controlled, however, as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister has pointed out, Slovenes wants to ban their borders for refugees, however.
"Each member of the EU must complete its obligations, otherwise the system will not work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian Government said, the first refugees had already tried, in the evening hours of Tuesday, to pass through eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik / Sid border crossing, in order to avoid registering.
The Croatian police were able to take them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to the local media, since then the Croatian Tovarnik has always held police vehicles with new refugees.
These are predominantly Syrians and Afghan people, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the next few days, his country with around 4 000 refugees will be counting, said interior minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo to the Macedonian-Serb border, which until now had transferred migrants to the Hungarian border, diverted Croatia, agreed to Croatia's Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was, the people wise to proceed to certain routes: "Neither can we nor do we do it," it said.
According to the media reports, at least in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serb border city of sid, while the day would expect more buses.
From Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants were travelling all night on the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometres away from Serbia.
"We heard that Hungary has done so, so the police said to us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
In fact, in actual fact, as observers have already predicted postponement of the previous Balkan route, Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary will come to a somewhat farther west route.
Croatia: "Comprehensive cross-border control"
Croatia's Minister for Internal Affairs, Ostojic, had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for exceptional circumstances in the case of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention it, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had 'comprehensive cross-border control'.
You have strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007, and since 2007 the EU partners have been providing good evidence of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they would have spent the last night at the Horgos which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now wish to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Minister for the Interior, Mr Nebojsa Stefanovic, tried to reassure Wednesday morning at a local eyewitness in horgos: It seems premature to discuss alternative routes for refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
At present, it would not be very high numbers of refugees.
They cannot say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Aid workers - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia.
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia, however, is not dangerous: In parts of the border there is still, 20 years after the end of the Bosnian war, there is still not enough minefield.
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mines were sent to the border region.
Subcontracting hackers: Ukrainians are paying $30 million.
Supranonok is supposed to have been a ring of cybercriminal who has been accused since 2010 for ever more insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire.
The exploited information means that insider trading in the financial markets has been made.
In this way, according to the experts, over 100 million dollars have been put in place.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are finally caught," says it in the SEC communication.
The processes against 32 other defendants in the case lasted.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted both in the United States and in Eastern Europe.
Swiss Hospital Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years.
There is lively operation around the Mannheim-style square.
The people are doing their worries, partly quick steps, partly relaxing.
You control the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalat.
Keep to the streets.
Vibrant, pralles life with wonderful autumn sun and mid-ends four large plates each with the title "Before or I will be mortal...."
The Ecumenical Hospemination drew attention to its 20 years of existence, and it is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went through the action in the middle of the city and under the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospetool provides passers-by as well as the volunteer staff.
During many a passport spontaneous to a chalk, and read the sentence around "my life," "read," "to read" with campers move by the United States, "" to stop the war "or" do not suffer for a long time ", others remain short, read, say phrases like" so far I'm not yet, "and then go on.
Time and again, there are little discussions about the action itself, about life, how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also present on site.
"Only if I make it clear that eventually will come to the end of this world, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonic plant Mannheim, which is joint with the Caritasverband carrier of the Swiss hospital hospital.
Therefore, this high-profile action for the 20 year olds is good.
Not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the panels, but understand, after all, it is a very personal thing.
The subject of death and dying is still taboo, such as the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospital movement in recent years has contributed a great deal to the opening up of people.
An assessment, which Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death knight is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Through personal experience with the subject, they read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospemination was searched for honorary public opinion, she immediately asked for it, and was in charge when it was established in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - who accompanies those affected and family members in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can do good with her task and his experiences and experiences.
"I see life from a different good, it seems to be precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant Ecumenical Hospital is free and non-religious.
The financial support of health insurance funds and donations from family members and associations allows for training and further education and for the superiors.
Every two years training courses for new employees are offered.
The signs described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Also, additional personal requests can be made on postcards.
FedEx-Results mixed Finance prospects for 2016 lowered
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery he-gigant lowered his win-win position to an entire year owing to the weakening demand for freight services and higher costs in its naval service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for their holidays.
At that time last year FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share price was more than 2.5 percent in the Premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening of Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and 10.90 $in the fiscal year that ends next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected a poll of FactSet 10.84 $.
In spite of price increases, an average of 4.9 percent, and on 4 January will be effective on 4 January, and, in spite of higher supplies of heavy and large packages, which will be raised from November onwards.
The company said that there is still a expectation that earnings will increase compared to the previous year because of cost reduction, increased revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will deliver solid yields if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trading. "
Plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that announced by the rival UPS, which plans to stop ECU 90.000 to 95.000 additional workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, just behind the $2.44 per share, which the twelve analysts predicted by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent to €12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks experienced analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decrease in international priority shipping in recent years, which resulted in sales in its unit Express Shipping to Stagnung.
But the boom in online shopping has increased results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in soil transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result was reduced by higher labor costs in freight.
In the Premarket trade, about one hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by about $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to 150,15 $.
On Tuesday, they had 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high of 11 June.
At the most anticipated part-session in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spent two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the interest rate for the first time since almost a decade.
Looming over them at an end of the decorated, two-storey hall is a wall image of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues want to put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximizing US employment and price stability here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed has recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to wriggle out of the unprecedented incentive from the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most data on the economy show that they grow well, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could frighten the already cautious Fed officials frightened by raising interest rates for federal bonds - and even a quarter percentage point.
"Apparently, the labour market and inflation are first of all the most important thing they see," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economic at the Maklercompany Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse to not increase the interest rate, the increased insecurity around the global market enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed is going to do, and what it creates in itself the financial market.
About half of economists, who were interviewed recently by Bloomberg, predicted an interest rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator, which represents only a 30% chance on an increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists can mitigate the blow by promising that a further increase is a long way off.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped to 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintained the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise for the Fed to lift the rates at that point, "he said.
If it does, "it should go far enough in its statement to reassure the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would reassure the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to raise a rate of 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that, this year, despite the claims of liberals, that more economic progress would be required, it would expect an increase in the sentence.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level the Fed views as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And, while inflation was constantly below 2% of the central bank, the Fed's representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shephertraus, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets joined the entire world at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average was more than 16% below its peak, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would cut global growth.
The market has recovered this month, with the Dow now being nearly 10% below the peak of May.
For the Fed's representatives, market turbulence will influence complex calculations, when interest rates should be increased.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about China's weakness in the last few weeks would not have occurred during this sitting, they would be taking the reins at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former US Federal Reserve staff.
Now he says that they will wait at least one month to get better grip on the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is none of the Fed's main concern, so it should not be included in its decision-making.
But, in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint of the then director Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion, triggered confusion around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interdependent, they can expect the Fed's leaders to monitor not only developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Its decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, Head of the global strategy for asset management of the company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreaction on financial market movements that are apparently not connected with economic fundamentals."
A member of the Federal Open Market Committee, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, and a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, argued in favour of raising interest rates, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions, "despite its limited impact on US growth," he said.
A year later, the Fed representative reversed these cuts.
The Fed should focus on financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 collapse of 2008, when Adam S. Poznań, former member of the committee, said that the Bank of England should be set aside.
The recent turbulence does not come close to that level, he said.
"You certainly do not want to be in a position to fear an increase in interest rates, because the markets are exciting," said Poznań, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until this is changed, I do not think it should be ahead of time.

Hoyerswerda: Little Aid for Refugees for Refugees
More and more refugees are coming to Germany in Germany.
To prepare a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, there are a whole series of people who support altruistic asylum seekers in the city.
They belong to Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher and a teacher.
Even with their 74 lists, they are still waiting for them.
Every Thursday they do it in the asylum seeker at the Dillinger Straße.
They help refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, that's very different lesson than in a proper school.
Brazil's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS is trying, in a shocking way, to inform women about the importance of good nutrition during the breastfeeding period.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are forced to raise their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child may have a negative effect on the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The Regional Council Bernried approved the construction application for the Euro 2.3 million sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof is to be used for solar panels.
The planning for the long-awaited radio station construction at the Bernrieder Sportground are moving step by step: At the recent municipal council meeting, the elaborated construction application was unanimously approved without major discussions.
Previously, the body had, among other things, adopted a motion for a "exemption" of "exemption" from the existing building plan.
The exception was the permission for a special form with regard to roof construction.
Consequently, a "covered roof with non-co-joined first and roof outlay is supposed to be built.
Background planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems. "This brings us to a wonderfully large southern roof," said mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In the case of "liberation," it turned out to be the roof that is supposed to be below ten degrees for energy reasons, unlike the building plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary because the layout of the building plan does not allow for "exceptions" to the opening of the roof - whereas the Bernrieder municipal council usually takes a restrictive approach to liberating applications.
However, this project is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," so Steigenberger.
Turnkey construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
About EUR 2.3 million is being calculated at the expense.
Grants are expected from education and support activities.
In the next step, the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will be submitted to the council for examination.
Clinic Peißenberg rides to Schongau.
The Peißenberg Hospital is supposed to be closed earlier - 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) is the new doctor at the hospital Schongau.
The station as well as the majority of the employees pull from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is apparent from the surprising plans of the Landkreis Hospital, which Andrea Jochner-White confirmed.
However, a decision on this will be subject to the Supervisory Board, and the meeting will be held on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the under 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Peißenberg.
The overwhelming majority should move with the fishermen and the existing internal station to Schongau.
The rooms are there.
In Weilheim, employees who are unable to get to Schongau should be offered a job, such as Jochner-white.
The staff is aware of the plans.
From now on, Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been a doctor since the beginning of the year, is now a director of the Schongauer Clinic and has now moved to a private practice in the vicinity of the hospital.
When asked, who is supposed to take the lead, came with Jochner-white, the name "fisherman" who declared himself ready to take over from 1 October and to switch with his team to the Schongau.
For the Haus in Schongau, this means "appreciation" and a broadening of the range of products in the field of "internal medicine," such duo-white.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemaker and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialised in the interior of gastroenterological diseases.
Over the next two years, with his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, with his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, both houses will lead until next year the former hospital in Peißenberg, which still has 35 beds, will finally be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
Until now, the district had planned for 2018 if the current rehabilitation at the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Landrätin Jochner-White, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, joined scaffolding with the idea that the house, which is in possession of the Federal Reserve, should be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future.
"I will end this" as it continues with the property, Jochner-white did not say, there were several considerations.
At the moment there is a short-term care for Caritas and a gay psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, this kind of opportunity does not happen again," says fishermen about the fact-finding of the Lech, which was received by the staff "positive and understanding full."
A real perspective for the home where fishermen have been working as chief doctor for over 30 years, have not given it.
He was asked by Schongauer to take over the position of the medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (once 100 beds) was repeatedly threatened by closure over the past decades, departments closed, for example, surgery and obstinacy.
The handball of the Rhine-Neckar lion has been called for this evening (20.15 p.m.) at the Bergisch HC.
The league table leader in Wuppertal is the clear favourite, but there is no reason to exaggerate.
In the last season, the Badener at the BHC made a painful defeat and have made something good there.
Hunting in case of two injuries with Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their maize harvest during the Tuesday afternoon.
During the visit to a corn field at Pratau (county of Wittenberg) several hunters were deployed, as reported by the police.
After a shooting charge, a man of 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and were hospitalized.
As exactly as the accident happened, it was initially unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crimes
A suspected crime has led to the police being exposed to the 16-year old age of the Rhineland-Palatinate that has been missing from Saturday.
In interrogation, the 20-year-old man killed the young and thrown their corpses into a channel in Rockenhausen.
Since Saturday 16-year-old from the Rhineland-Palatinate has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The suffering of the young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, such as the public prosecutor and police on Wednesday morning.
As a suspect, a 20-year-old one is also a 20-year-old who, according to the fact, said that he was in charge and that the investigators led to the location of the corpses.
The 16-year-olds had been reported missing on Sunday morning after they had not arrived at the home on the eve of a visit to Rockenhausen just after a visit to Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, investigators came up with personal objects of the victim.
In the case of interviews with friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, a crime against the 20-year-old is found.
The alleged perpetrator led the police then to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, according to the authorities, it was reported that the 16-year-old was killed and the body placed in the channel.

Refugees need shelter: A study warns of housing gaps.
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
Even more and more refugees are looking for affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distributional fighting on the German housing market began a long time ago.
With the incoming refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 each year.
To this end, a study is carried out on behalf of the mailing list "Social Housing."
For comparison: In Germany 260,000 units will be finished this year.
As a result, there are a total of 140 000 homes.
After the first three months of residence, refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial reception.
Many encounter the housing market and the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the statistics agency in the last year, however, less than half of all asylum seekers go to rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not just about rising numbers of refugees.
The study also makes significant omissions in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is shooting up a housing deficit, which will grow from year to year.
Currently there are already over 77,000 housing units in the agglomerations, and Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals, therefore, have lived in large scale areas in WG-rooms.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in "Hotel Mama" due to the stranglehold on the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square metres per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the "Social Housing" alliance suggests a reboot.
At the same time, new incentives are intended to restore social housing.
In this way, the basic tax would be abandoned, and the basic tax on supported housing would be suspended.
In addition, there is a need for attractive tax depreciation capabilities, according to the Alliance.
The support program for refugee accommodation of the Federal Bank KfW is already well received in towns and cities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the EUR 300 million available was already available on Monday evening, with EUR 184 million.
Now, the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free reign: Croatia and Slovenia align a corridor with a single corridor.
After Hungary, there is virtually no passage, since more and more refugees are choosing the route through Croatia.
Zagreb announces the opening of the route via Slovenia to the north without any obstacles.
However, dangerous is the route.
Croatia wants to reach agreement with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian Minister for Foreign Affairs and, if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria, and it is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
Following the closure of the Serb-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have fled to Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV broadcast RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the previous day.
New laws that came into force on the same day, moreover, make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to pass through the refugees.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can go through and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police arrested the first refugees on Serbia's border with Croatia's neighbouring country.
Most of them were media reports from Syria, Iran, and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and taxi to the border town of Sid.
Immediately upon arrival, they would have been tempted to walk over the green border into Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serb border, refugees do not cross border fences.
There are other dangers to border with the border, where there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990 "s.
Mine clearance is now supposed to quickly create a safe passage.
After the closure of the border, after the closure of the border, Hungary will have little more refugees.
On Tuesday, the police were infected in 366 people.
Shortly before closing on a Monday, it was still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws to overcome and damage the border fence are a criminal offence.
Therefore, in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 cases of criminal proceedings have been initiated.
The convicts are liable to hold up to five years of deportation and deportation.
According to the Immigration Authority, a total of 94 asylum requests were accepted on Tuesday in the new "transeda" of the border, almost all of them - 93 - in the most important transition to Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, there were still 40 refugees.
But virtually no-one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to the Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.
Before the 'transit zone' in Röszke, there were only a few hundred refugees.
In Röszke they start to clean up workers.
They collected the rubbish that tens of thousands of people had left behind in the last few weeks.
Blacknets were mined, and one of the places of residence in the border has been rebuilt.
No one wanted to say something about this restructuring.
Austria reached only a few refugees following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
However, more than 20,000 migrants, according to government information, were still in the country.
About 1400 people are waiting for their journey to Germany in Salzburg.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning with instructions from the German authorities.
In Freight, small groups of refugees have regularly arrived at foot.
Mayors headed "rock sides" over the border
"We were on Sunday with the elevator, when suddenly ten people stood at the entrance of the tent," said Alexander Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because Germany was surprised by rail traffic with Austria on Sunday, but as a result of the flow of refugees, it was in Wernstein's end, "says Stadler, who immediately offered his assistance, and who climbed the border with two further helpers and their cars across the border into the vicinity of Passau.
First of all, we have looked at the unexpected guests first, with breaks and drinks.
We have said straight away, we bring it with the car to Passau.
"It was for us, of course," so Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man could not take over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"He was very pleased with us," says Stadler.
On Sunday evening in Wels in Wels, the stranded train passenger switched from an ICE to Passau towards Passau to see, following the short-term cancellation that railway traffic to Germany had been discontinued, but still to try to cross the border.
The regional train, however, was shut down at the Inn in Wernstein.
In Wernstein, cross-border crossing is generally high.
The bridge-up association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, sociable, days before a two-bridge course - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán is now sending tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Rather than helping in the camp Röszke immediately to establish structures, to ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has made a high official and public opinion of the Hungarian Government's attitude towards the Dark Alliance of National Socialism.
It is not only the Austrians who are the victims of this policy who are now faced with a chaotic state of affairs in border areas.
The people who fled, too, will find that the "promised land," which they invited and welcomed, is just another refugee camp.
It will be a big challenge, given the continuing flow of refugees and the beginning of winter, with us humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And there will be an even greater - peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad on the search for 355,000 winter-fixed quartz
Konrad has every hand to do with the deportation of refugees.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen bankers to build up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already managed to get a grip on the chaos at the Traiskirchen centre.
"We have no homeless more in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
Also, the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was done without great commotion, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterpiece".
The Ministry of the Interior, however, spoke of a "crisis-rich situation."
In total, Konrad is expected to take place in the year with a requirement for 85,000 quartz animals.
In order to meet the number, 35 000 accommodations must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries, 15.000 of the federal government.
Should there be more refugees, we can do it.
"But there is no bottomless pit," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the head of the country.
They would have given him the opportunity to create more refugees for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it is good," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, who will be told how the church will help.
Great expectations also put the Asylum Coordinator also in the ORF campaign "Helfen as we."
On the platform, private individuals can offer accommodation easy accommodation.
In addition, one hopes to see hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticised yesterday the standards for accommodation as "very high."
In case of emergency, it is not possible for travel agents to observe a certain amount of headscarf or the size of the upper light.
For a temporary period, "emergency standards" should be applied.
In contrast to the interior ministry, Konrad Adenauer is based on his experience.
I am an older gentleman, who is no longer on the face of falsehood on the face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not give the republic costs, as they themselves said.
Their number of employees wants to increase them to between three and four times.
So far, our own refugee camps have not been successful.
Konrad wanted to establish a container at St. Stephen's Square as an office.
But there are apparently problems with approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings, such as Tips Arena and the Design Center for the accommodation of refugees, are planning the city of Linz.
At the moment, this is not necessary, as they are unable to accommodate these measures at the moment, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
For an emergency, other sites are to be tested for their suitability.
Criticism is exercised by the city's leaders in dividing up the refugees within the state of the Federal Republic.
Other districts, too, must make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders will not be sealed"
In an extended telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Provincial Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) investigated further action on the refugee issue on Monday.
Seehofer assured me that German borders were not sealed.
The journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, it is precisely the border controls that are at hand here.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be there for the time being.
However, the interested parties would be transferred to Germany with regular trains.
For the other EU member states Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity on the issue of refugees.
The fact that Austria is now introducing controls on its borders is a logical consequence for Pühringer's actions.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The general overhaul of the "New Shipyard" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially closed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building is the listed IT group S & T, the rest (2700 square meters) is intended to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In the IT, the wise brains are our raw material - and we must try to work for us," says S & T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine to invest in Startup s in the New Shipyard and later on to deal with.
From the very beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - something that Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
EUR 10 million has been invested by S & T in the location, EUR 3.3 million from the TechCenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Government (FFG).
The building is covered by Linz AG for 60 years with S & T as well as TechCenter.
30 percent of the 2700 m2 of residual land in the building are already rented, for a further 40 percent there are questions.
LIA-Peroni-holder opened second shop in the arcade.
In the new shop Furla handbags are centre stage.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog.
This project had to get rid of the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt arcade: After all, it has now grown in the form of a new business community.
In the Furla Shop right opposite the shop where they are selling bags, luggage bags, shoes and clothes from different manufacturers, all you are now are talking about women's hand bags of the Furla brand, which are available as from 75 euros.
Larger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday the new shop is running.
It has been modified for several weeks.
"I have long thought about whether to open a shop," says Breit.
The decisive factor for the decision was the fact that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of a separate site where they only sold their handbags.
"We are the only ones in the area of Linz that sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who have themselves Italian roots.
Her fashion interests have been taken to the cradle by her mother.
I'm not sure if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
If so many women are looking for a nice hand bag, then the lady can't answer with last safety.
Maybe it is because a beautiful bag fits into every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump's ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called givers.
This property also shares with the billionaire that the US president wants to be.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether it expresses xenophobic opinions, journalists, or obscure knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency raises a heavy blow to the election campaign.
And cuts well.
This will also be registered in the Silesian Kallstadt where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the Fconcilifrisur is a concept many in the winzerdorf at the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant site is over -zig corners with him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, in the campaign mode.
The brave town of Simone Wendel turned a movie about Trump.
And what is the view of the villagers about being the most powerful man in the world?
"I think that they find this somewhat exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter Art," says Simone Wendel.
The legendary Kallstadt has filmed an amusing documentary about the town and its famous jumps, among which Trump also counts the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, not known for modesty, comes to the "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014), saying that he would surely succeed if he lived in Kallstadt.
For the King of the hearts he did not bring it there.
Although there is respect for the family's performance, but they also tend to think that Trump is a bit a great thing, "says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname "The Brulljesmacher" - "The Brulljesmacher" - has been loud enough to say "The Brulljesmacher" - the helper, she says.
Trump, therefore, comes from the village of the patrons.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a pub for gold graves in the USA.
The foundation of the real estate group was the first real estate acquisitions in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not free from tragedy: Their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not include Trump because he was allowed to escape without permission, the director of the Institut für pfälzische Geschichte und Volksunde, Roland Paul, explained the film start.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigration."
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants.
It has repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just like mine, this is not so pleasant," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant cousin ("The Oma was a born Trump, the Opa was born Heinz").
For his retirement, he sees the Americans rather distancing himself, "he is always so brausending."
Does he believe that Trump is coming?
"I can't think of it," says the 72 year old.
"He never bothered about Kallstadt."
The wife Veronika Schramm mentioned, as some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the family Heinz in a visit for a visit ended what was generally good.
"I can't tell myself about that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if he did not fight the election, because "he's such radical views, I do not know if that is good."
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the USA were as he was there, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My president is not," she says.
And, "the grapes will be ripe without the president, Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12 000 students, including in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian town of Ramsau in Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain auction village."
From the hand of the Vice-President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800 inhabitants of Berchtesgaden received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountain climbers" villages.
In the neighbouring country, the local Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
An "mountain climbers" must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as an area of protection.
At the end of the 20th century, he was the only one to take part in the world championship.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurried to Canberra to report the loss of leader of the liberals, but there has been no significant shifts in the ratings for Today.
The breakfast show of Nine was broadcasted by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull abolished the ouster of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, sat in London as part of a weekly series of international TV shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage for Australian TV viewers seemed to have no role to play, as sunrise averaged 397,000 spectators to the five capitals, compared to that's 39,000.
Today, a slight increase against the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure remained behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today, over the last few months, the gap to Sunrise has been closed.
On average, 318,000 was reached in August compared to 318,000 by Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Up to now in September, Sunrise has an average of 314,000 people on average about 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are in order, thank you for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of sack to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently lost father, who disagrees with his two children on the New Zealand coast, reached an impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were asked if Thomson had a hit-show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night's reply was a resounding "yes."
The X-Factor of Seven remained with 1,136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726,000).

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he elect?
Mystery revealed?...
Lana Jeeme-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski have probably unwittingly appear to have won The Bachelor.
Die Frau, bei der Sam Wood in The Bachelor ultimately lands, wurde in diesem Schutz abØr.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether they are the ones who have received the last rose.
But when we were talking to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jestell-Fellows in the day before they checked three two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps its lips up to the final on Thursday firmly sealed
All three women have missed out on lyrical about why wood is the perfect man and called it his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "if not you, who should have the Woods last Rose," could become their answers to the misrule, who won the heart of Bachelors.
Jez.@-@ Fellows and Markoski were both quick - apart from himself - Mackay as the best partner for wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other on the first day.
"From the moment when I went to the house, and (Sarahs) and Sam's energies noticed, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I've thought this throughout the course of the show," said Jeenes-Fellows.
"Sarah is with both feet on the earth, it makes so much fun to be with it," added Markoski.
I have seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited to couples.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the home visit last week made it clear to her that Wood is "the One."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became obvious to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now fully satisfied with him," she said.
And when she was asked, whom Wood should choose, if not it, it was puzzled.
"I do not know if I can say this," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a contradiction between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor's degree will be on Wednesday, 19: 30, at ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his career career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tominson, and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank, when he lost a wrangling as it did with the Aussie Rugby League Convertit in his first Punt return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tominson trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to take a Punt return and also in the ongoing game after a breach of Reggie Bush.
Tomwards continued to show his real face in the dressing room after the match.
Instead of putting his rookies before the rest of the team, they encouraged them.
Tomato reinforced Hayne also publicly held in its press conference after the match.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman, that Hayne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who told him to forget his patched catches and to take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patched on a punt which was restored to the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter.
It certainly wasn't the start that Hayne and his massive Australian entourage had hoped for his podium debut.
Hayne left behind the Fumble to curse the pitch and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a worse start into his career career,
"That's a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that is it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his origin debut in 2007, when a passport with his own goal area led to a Try for Queensland.
All in all, it was a great experience for the 27 year olds.
Hayne presented for a photo with fans, keeping an Australian flag after the game and post it on his instagram.

Free voters are asking for the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria, because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn klausur in Great Wallstadt facing a severe crisis in Bavaria's schools, if there are new teachers for the many new students, "we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will get fault lines in the Bavarian education system."
Open-air voters meet up to Friday in the northern part of the municipality.
In fact, there were a number of other major issues.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the free-voter meeting.
"Of course, the subject of asylum will overflow the examination," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the creation of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria, as they did during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"Do not continue, we must get to the causes," said the Free voter.
Rejected asylum seekers want to postpone the free-of-charge voters as quickly as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also asked for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum law: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW boss criticised the fact that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards across the federal states."
"Bavaria wants to move, others do not."
'We need to become more capable of more effective action '.
But let us not fall within the scope of politics in large-scale Wallonia.
A long-standing burglar will remain on the agenda: Education policy.
For the new year of school, cult minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot project "Medium Level Plus" at 47 Gymnasia, when an extension of the high-school middle level was tested from three to four years - the result will be nine years up to the Abitur.
That, however, does not go far enough.
"The topic G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW boss.
We call for freedom of choice for all Gymnasia who want it.
Free ride to G9 anywhere, where it is desired.

Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in the south of Nepal, after the police shot in a crowd of people who protested against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence ended on Tuesday evening at the district of RupanExpi, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishop nu Prasad Dhakal, Department of State officials, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said, the police have been using tear gas and then shot into the air before they get back on rubberpants.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the applied rubber body used by which they are able to kill, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The discussion was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violence since the 10th.
August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to share the country in provinces - an important step toward a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which for centuries has been centrally governed.
The work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but legislators speeded up the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area in the city planned
The plot of land at the Emder youth center Alte Post is to be rebuilt again.
The city is currently preparing for the commercialisation of the 4000 square metres area.
A mix of trade, industry and housing is planned, but there is still no specific offer.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a 4,000 square meter lot of land in direct vicinity to the Old Post Youth Centre.
Preparations for this are under way.
The aim is to make use of the premises for a mix of trade, industry and housing.
You are waiting for corresponding offers, called it from the city.
What kind of investor is in question is not yet clear.
Similarly, no treaties have been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a portion of the land which is situated on the Ringstrasse / corner - a few months ago.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the rural settlement at the Little Sea at Emden are taking shape.
For the first time, the investor presented public plans for the project.
Many of them are still concerned - they fear the sale of their spare time.
For months, we negotiated behind closed doors, debated, debated and drawn up.
Now the plans for a new holiday resort settlement at the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
For the first time, the interest and medium-sized enterprise "system construction," exhibited its plans for the first time in the urban development committee of the Council.
Originally, this point had been placed on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critic and the German Free Democratic Party, who led investors and the administration of secrecy with secrecy, Ralf Behrends went on the offensive with the construction management company: "We have not yet answered all questions," he said before the members of the council and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumours now.
The EUR 10-12 million projects worth EUR 12 million have been under discussion for months.
Strong reactions among marine owners, who came to the meeting, called the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, Meerbudenowner and member of the Executive Board of the Association of Anchers, Pro Hieve says, "It will be a giant clone, which will surprise all the others."
Moreover, like many other project critics, he fears that traffic is going to increase as a result of the planned size of the plant: "There is a need for all bus charges to come," says Schulz.
However, what exactly is going on for a hectare of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First of all we have to have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because it was still missing, the architectural plans are still variable.
Zwillings for Gorillas im Frankfurt Zoo

Google started a doubling donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. O) announced a duplication campaign of $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach when announcing the donation call on his blog.
Instead of leaving a manager to make the announcement, Rita Masoud wrote a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, about their personal experiences.
"To our journey were many dark railroad and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," they wrote.
I was lucky.
But, as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown, many people, like my family, are desperate for help.
Donations go to four non-profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donation will be doubled to a value of 5.5 million to google.com / tracerelayed to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For slightly obese diabetics, weight-loss surgery can be helpful.
The advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is too early to say if slightly obese people live with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote a temporary article to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different ways to decrease the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity operations for the treatment of type-2 diabetes have been proven to be effective, but most studies have been carried out with human beings who are malignant with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Sheng General Hospital used data that they have gathered since 2007 in a study, comparing two types of obesity-surgery - stomach cleavage and heartburn - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes among people who were easily obese.
The average BMI below those who underwent this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI has remained in non-surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29.
Among those subjected to a surgical procedure, 36% left the disease completely and at 28% in part.
In a medically-treated group, diabetes was completely reduced to only one percent and partly with only about 2%.
In addition, the results were better in the 'surgical' group ', the triglyceride and the "bad" LDL cholesterol, "the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood mirror of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemogglobin A1c is best held under 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from around 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, such as Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost weight when compared to the Gastrektomy Group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), reaching greater drops in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1% vs. 2.1%), and included a complete removal of the diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not have a survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that leads operation to a longer life, Blackstone tells Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, there were some 29 percent less likely to die during the course of 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group" without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to take people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have gathered these genetic changes, which have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes, they are really hard to reverse. "

"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe - the Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real resolution of the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his 10 day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the individual nations or even continents under the circumstances.
He also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was merely a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime, you must think of long-term solutions, think about how to create true peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he emphasized.
Ultimately, we must think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke of the problem of violence, and commented George Bush's actions following the terrorist attack of 11 September, and it turned out that the US's violent response has led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush, and I said to him that the way to resolve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he resorted to violence, and this caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
4. Increased consumption by children during the last 4 years.
Poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400-percent increase in children under the age of 12, who swallow highly alcoholic hand disinfectants, such as the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of revenue of pawns in children under the age of 12, containing toxic control centres, rose from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children come more and more often to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them go in the emergency," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectant, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young teenagers are drinking disinfectant just because of a cheap adventure.
Young people have been eating disinfectants with soft mouth water to get a harder drink.
Young children can be attracted by the attractive fragrances of the disinfectant.
"A child does not think this is bad," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hands-disinfectants) are those that are paraffable.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapes and oranges, which are very appealing for children.
Hangdedisinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially with small children, few injections can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of Giftnotcall center at the Hospital of the University of Kansas, Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you would not be muzzled by whisky, but people leave this hand disinfectant in range of children, and if children come to it, then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently took four sprayers from the time of strawberry-hungry gun infection at school, was taken to a hospital for treatment.
His alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold of being legally drunk with an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency medical doctor, who was treated at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah lallated their words and was unable to go when they arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors were watching them overnight in a separate children's hospital at the point of brain trauma, because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had come to the head, said Ritchey.
"This was very worrying," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store suspended disinfectants outside the range of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died following the swallowing of suspended disinfectant, which contained a toxic, non-declared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was quoted as an active substance.
In January, three students from the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their "a" teacher by setting up antibacterial products around the classroom, "reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to suspended disinfectants and banked them out of their room.
The police looked at the thwarted plan as "talking" and directed disciplinary measures at the school authority.

The lack of headline competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Boer
The former rank player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that Dutch soccer fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, at the moment an ambassador for Ajax said: "In Holland, they don't make some of the highlights of the Celtic Games more and why?"

Why I am witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except in the case of late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I will sit in a spectator gallery in the Death Chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed through the Giftspritze.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January on his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day became closer, I began to fear myself.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States and, since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Who will be selected, will watch it emotionally.
I cannot do that.
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossips's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephones and a two-and-a-half hours of visits.
I like the guy.
We often laugh very much when we speak.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma blamed me on Twitter to abandon my impartiality.
That is the lesson here.
Tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and you get access.
I agree with her.
She admitted that she could have put it better, but she still thinks he is wrong, what I do.
Richard Glober had problems with some of the things that I said and written.
He does not tell me what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at all times.
But he wants an international reporter present to write there.
If he died, he thinks that the public relations campaign against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit beside me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I will not dwell on all the details here again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe that there is insufficient evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can address this.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
After a long time the canning River came to the end of the Canning River.
The canning Vale policeman remained dry when he overthrew the man of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to guard the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and marshy waters, a few metres from a police officer who tried "him gently to persuade him to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale was called in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, they tried to escape toward the Canning River.
But he did not get far too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not out, come to me," said Senior Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to get his uniform wet, so he turned a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman."
"Sometimes people do things to try to escape," said Senior Farage Castledine.
Championship football players Ben Cougans offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins drove his car to the ditch to escape the control of alcohol, and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts have been unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that stewards were trying to spy on him and threatened to end racing.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He focused on the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media, that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and himself found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt-tail probe at Lidaris that he cannot explain.
He had withheld 18 months for spying charges and did not want to see it "look like too high grapes."
"I had nothing to say, and I have been watching for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything is coming out," said Moody.
You know that it went on.
They sometimes react, and they have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around the main ones, and I want my owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking I do not, then I should not be more trainers.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department tried to spy on its stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I shall be called, if I was asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to deliver information about what I'm doing in my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
They seem to think that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should surely take part in their nuts, because they have failed in trying to catch up.
President of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at this time and are still today.
Should that be my opinion that it will be personally?
Does the RVL have a cowardly attitude and perhaps makes people out of trainers are responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people are thinking out there that I am there.
They may have to take my license and I do not have any doubt that what I say now makes them think about it.
But I have come to the point at which I don't care about it, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to take a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The student's degree levels are based on the long-lasting cobalt examination at Lidari, and the late Scratching led him to say that he could throw his licence over the table. "
Moody, best known by his preparation for the undefeated Master's Black Caviar, called the racing day-treatment rule "ridiculous," after a pack of mud or sound was applied on the horses, which ran against the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing sport.
I have to take on full responsibility, "he said.
"One of my staff mistakenly applied mud on the leg.
It could have been yesterday evening.
It could have been the whole day yesterday, and that was the way it was.
It was on the racing day as well.
With a three month disqualification for the handling of the pack on the race day, a survey of this matter has been launched.
It is a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We are all aware that we need rules, but here we have gone too far," said Moody.
The Trap Trap of the Drill Trap
At the weekend, the police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist and followed driver curling in Cobram.
The cyclone in the Royal Melbourne Hospital was then delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray-Valley-Highway.
The police said, the driver continued to continue, without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia was the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be indicted for drivers' currification and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in a stable state.
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy proposes against rivals for claims on ring fighting back.
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy has criticized his player's "Agenda Setting" of two Premier League favorites.
Sydney ROOSTERS Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referee has allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening.
A few years later, when his team had made a final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made an almost forgotten remark about the storm team, who called the game a "sample" of the Rugby League and said that the two were not "too good" in fighting for the two from Queensland.
Bellamy defended his team and said that they were focusing on their "contact."
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team gives him a confident vote, since it means that they worried about being beaten by the storm team.
"I didn't hear that Trent Robinson spoke about Ringfights when they hit us 24: 2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real priority, and that has turned out to us to be a turning point.
Trent has been there for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he is probably not accustomed to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is funny, as it always appears at this time of the year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennetie's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his match on Saturday evening to our on the Friday evening, and how exciting his game was, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take a slap in the drain.
But now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when playing this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things, because they are somewhat worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they did not think of us when we were talking about big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against ROOSTERS achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against cowboys.
The shooting of the Broncos was probably a good game, I have not seen it yet, but what was the result 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two other tests in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points?
For me it is the game plans.
If they mention it, it means that we will be meeting at a stage.
The storm-team won this weekend, having won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday evening at the AAMI Park.
He is working with a $200,000 bail-out to bail him out.
A man who may have a lifetime sentence because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kg of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released for a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and arrived in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as his co-accused in the Marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse met where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possibly viable punishment for trying to possess a commercial crowd of cocaine, the attorney of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the threat of flight to Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he said to the court on Wednesday.
When he was criminal, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics's mother and stepfather had offered a bail of $200,000 to reach his release.
"After reading the declarations made by the two people it is clear that the obligation of security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions he gave his Australian and Serbian pass, daily reports to the police daily, and an initial blocking from 18: 00 to 06: 00.
Accident at junction A5 in Karlsruhe: Guide house splits apart.
In case of an accident involving three lorries on the 5 of Karlsruhe, a lorry driver has been seriously injured on the Tuesday evening.
Two of the three lorries involved had slowed down in the direction of Basle.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to avoid at the last moment to move to the left, as the police said.
The carrier of the accident-causing plan completely dissolves.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely locked for about 6 hours to 2 p.m.
It was a damage of EUR 122,000.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to entice paedophiles to send pictures.
A paedophile used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl, when it was sleeping, settled into an online messaging service, of which he received a series of decent images of children who were sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
It looked through, found the confusing news and alerted her mother immediately.
The police took care of this and saw the five pictures, analyzed then computers that were found under the address found and discovered "related" web searches, the terms for the search for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to "paedophilia on the Internet" he then "preached to be a policeman to frighten them."
The Attorney Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was addiction, that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer of him, but said that it was done because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to attract them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
MS Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the mouth and in the wine.
They then saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused by doing so.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than they did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty, in the sense of the indictment, to have admitted indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year to have violated the conditions on 25 January this year, and not to be in court at a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked for Hogg not to appear in the register of sexual offenders, as they could be argued that "no significant sexual element" was found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael abandons the sentence by October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for consultations with other outstanding cases.
It was added to the list of sexual criminals before the date of the ruling.
Smugglers move on to small border crossings with Germany from the rest of the world.
More and more refugees are being picked up aside from the major checkpoints at the German-Austrian border.
Many people from fear of discovery and arrest made people more vulnerable to minor border crossings.
On the Austrian side, a speaker of the Federal Police said.
Along the River Elbe, more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They were on foot over bridges and dams on the German side.
They will be picked up by federal police officers and will be passed on to the registration process.
At Munich's main train station, following federal police data, there are again significantly more refugees compared to the first week of the week.
About 700 people were admitted to the capital until 8 a.m., saying a speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, the city reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Shoe of tropical jet "Henry" in the southwest expected
Meteorologists warn against storms in the south-west from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe flows currently warm sea air enters the land, divided by the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart.
The mighty Tief is the descendant of the tropical storm "Henry," which has been pulled over the Atlantic over the last few days.
Violent storms and thunderstorms are expected, especially in Baden.
According to the DWD, up to Thursday morning is also expected to be in the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Lake Constance region from 60 to 90 km.
On Friday, you can see the sun on Friday.
The mass makes it: Every two years, the automobile industry shows its innovations at the IAA.
In 2015, the first step is to identify the compact cars that are currently selling themselves particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are especially asked: About 28.1 percent of the new registrations have been included in this segment in August only in August.
This is also reflected at the IAA (official stages of the 17th to the 27th of September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new upper-class cars and luxury cars this year many new compact models will be presented.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be the traders in the autumn.
"Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to ensure that the volume model is sold well, the new Astra will not be much more expensive.
Opel provides an entry into the largest competitor of VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra will be available from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.
Additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / 200 hp are also available.
Other than the main rivals VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only just a fifth of them.
The second variant will be followed in the spring of the combi, which is already visible at the IAA.
And what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA?
Renault F1 Team Renault F1 Team Jenson Button is the first to have won the Grand Prix for the first time in the first season of the season.
At the trade fair, the Mégane is only seen as a fifth in a conventional and a more sporty GT version.
He will come to trade at the beginning of next year, and then as a combi.
Infiniti: Completely new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The new model will be able to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti adapts perfectly to the design line of the brand with its curved lines.
The basic model will be powered by a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp.
There is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is powered by a gasoline engine, including a newly developed 1.0 litre engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp.
The maximum torque depends on the manufacturer information at 170 Newtonmeters (Nm).
Sales start of the baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class engine DS 4, which is to be seen at the IAA.
On the other hand, the designers of the noble Citroën clerk mainly hand over the front panel: The fridge was redrawn and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, especially the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and was introduced for the first time Apples CarPlay.
In addition, at the IAA in the compact class a series of revisions and new variants like the upgraded Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin Tegel: Five m2 of cells are human beings unworthy of human beings.
The Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex-prisoner of Tegel law, which has been housed in too small a cell for months.
Because of their human dignity, prisoners are entitled to compensation if they are housed in small cells.
This decision decided on a decision published on Wednesday by the Federal Constitutional Court.
According to the judges, they can even hope for money if they have been imprisoned only a few days in the narrow spaces (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner with his constitutional decree was successful in Karlsruhe: He was in Berlin-Tegel in Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not separated from space.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer's information, was once again at liberty, moved to a larger cell.
His arrest warrant for the undignified conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed.
But the Constitutional Court brought up the judgment of the Court of Berlin in Berlin and pointed out the case for re-examination.
They see a violation of human dignity.
Court Court is now deciding on the level of compensation.
Even if, for legal reasons, it was only a few days during the period in which there was only a few days of liability for compensation, if there was a right to vote, it was said.
Otherwise, "a stranglehold on the person's legal protection would be feared."
The Chamber Court now has to clarify the amount of bonus damage.
In the past, the constitutional judges have often reinforced the rights of prisoners.
In April, they did not talk to a prisoner for compensation because they were imprisoned naked in a cell.
What is unworthy of a 2011 decision, according to a decision of 2011, is the multiplication of a cell without a separate toilet.
In addition, in addition, the Berlin Constitutional Court, which was a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009, confirmed an undignified place for a prisoner on Wednesday.
For three months, the then plaintiff was accommodated between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
In recent weeks, the Berlin prisons have also hit the headlines due to lack of staff.
Therefore, prisoners are spent time and again 23 hours, the aggressiveness is increasing, and it is due to the tense situation.
According to information from the legal network there are 21 posts in Munich due to lack of young talent, 19 should cease to expire in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: 'We are creating that'.
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is going on in Germany?
About 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany following forecasts by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year, when Vice-President Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is even able to accept a million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated, in the face of the unusual challenge, 'I say again and again: We can do that and we create that'.
What Germany has to offer is an overview of the following overview.
What's more, according to various estimates, there are between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Institute of Germany) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) flats annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built up (250000 flats).
The lack of living space, however, is mainly due to affordable rental properties: An annual fall of 60,000 to 80000 social housing is out of the rental price commitment, and these particularly favorable housing will also apply to refugees.
Federal Minister for Culture, Barbara Hendricks (SPD), therefore, wants to double, at the present time, EUR 518 million to EUR 1 billion.
Far too little is from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing needs to be created per year, and the Federal Government should invest a subsidy of 6.4 billion a year.
As far as scientists and the Federal Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany are concerned, the scientists and the Federal Minister of the Federal Republic agree that there is also a need for greater tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment and Social Research, it is estimated that in the long term, 55 percent of the displaced persons may be working in Germany.
However, in Germany, the refugees would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them to get started, they criticised Claudia Walter, Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Bertelsmann foundation.
But it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, Migrants Dietrich Thränhardt says.
In Germany, according to Threlhardt, there has been a political shift: From the ban on the work of refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was previously a ban on working for asylum seekers for up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence obligation which restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, also because of the shortage of specialists, the majority view is that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major hurdle for access to the labour market is a lack of German skills.
So far, there is still no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most commonly conveyed through personal contacts.
The creation of networks is therefore, in the opinion of Thränhardt, the gateway to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration found that only a few fled parents gave their children to the Kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Department.
To convince the family of the advantages of the Kita, the administration distributes handpapers in different languages.
If the need for educators is greatly increased by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - for example, by allowing for more education.
In the countries, pupils with no knowledge of German are prepared in welcome classes for lessons.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, and also by teachers, who only have qualifications in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Works has estimated that approximately 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
As a rule, there is no state of asylum seekers or patients who were not patient; the only exception was Berlin, Innensenator Frank Henkel (CDU) but abandoned his stance.
Student-minded refugees could be made easier to access the university.
For refugees with a haven of residence or toleration, there is no longer any merit after the asylum seeker's law when they start studying.
In principle, the latter do not have a Bafög, since they do not fall within the circle of eligible persons.
Patient refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years to be able to retire, from 1 January 2016 to 15 months.
This funding gap, too, needs to be closed, and Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk Potsdam are asking for it.
The students should receive BaföG immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have to the churches, and the existing state-of-church right to a new rule of religion would develop.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic Welfare Union, which would look after the new arrivals professionally.
The rights also involve obligations.
For that reason, the representatives of Islam must be a clear interlocutor and ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and give him some degree of control.
This also includes the willingness to take resolute action against religious fundamentalism.
The president of the Malaysian central council, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to deal with such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to come here, in Germany, "he said in the Bavarian broadcasting industry.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arabic.
In the future, integration will still be a matter for the whole of society.
This means that the majority society will have to change, and the removal of discrimination and racism will become more pressing.
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti-discrimination body for a decade and a general law on equality.
But it learns very slowly, as shown by the NSU series, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and non-white Germans have been calling for for a long time, and what international agreements, such as the Germany's anti-racism convention, will have to make a reality over the next few years, if the country is to stay peaceful and to take advantage of its new citizens - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany will be able to provide medical support to the refugees who have been expected to date, says doctors' president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"With respect to power and capacity, we create that," he said.
However, additional money must go into the system for that.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery requires that all arrivals be handed over during registration.
The services offered by the Federal Republic of Germany may be settled later in the federal states.
And, in the long run, it is highly questionable to cover so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seeker's report provides for asylum.
Otherwise, doctors, most of all, will create the language barriers.
To date, the Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has proven that migrants receive worse treatment than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in doctors' practices, they would have to take over interpretation costs, they are asking for it.
However, many refugees would already have more general medical contact facilities in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic eye.
For example, under refugee children, there are significantly more untreated disabilities and young people are talking about HIV.
With some other diseases, German doctors, however, realized that they knew Montgomery.
"Parasite or tuberculosis are not so hard to see." And as far as the doctor is concerned, perhaps even relief from the refugees in sight.
The Syrians would have a sophisticated education system, including a number of refugees, even doctors.
To be able to practice, however, they should be able to prove their qualifications and perhaps take them again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany, according to estimates, are psychologically ill: Most suffer from a posttraumatic stress or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by the TU Munich documented that each fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from, among others, so-called flash backs with respirators, diatrists, heart rye, and deviles.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong hortness and emotional deafness.
To avoid that the symptoms become chronic, be needed early treatment, Munz said.
So far, only four per cent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers may ask for psychotherapy in social councils, they usually take several months to work.
Moreover, social services tend to decide whether or not a treatment is necessary for mental illnesses not trained.
This often leads to misjudgement, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream of a dream.
With the new staging "passion" the circus will take a look at the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract every age group from fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream about the manege on the brick wall.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, an animal teacher and the Junior Junior.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current exhibition.
For more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the family.
So the family is in the blood when it comes to the gift.
"It is important for us to pull people away from their everyday life and take them in a completely different world for two hours," says the 27-year-old Junior Junior.
"A cocktail with world-city flair," says director Reinhard Probst his concept.
50 cities on the 3 000 kilometres long tour can now see this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded by the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family will enthuse the audience with humour and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent film, the Cuban duo wants to get up with it.
Lightness and mobility - with these words, they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is intended to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the circus also fascinates with sensitivity and voice.
Using a ball to balance a ball?
For He Yuan no problem.
Mosquitoes fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," Stephanies mother, Brigitte Probst.
Grievances in the attitude of circuses are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes a position: "Our animals are not good, it is not good for us."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit.
The "four-legged artists," as they are affectionately called, will be left to the eyes of the eyes on every request.
We want to work with animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not care about it, it does not want it.
The first thing, then, is good for animals.
Especially on their zebroid Jumbo, a mix of a Shetland ponyhengst and a zebra, the family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years, and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, was our little Jumbo da," said Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So I think there is something to be done for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," Stephanie Probst says: "Be it five or 1 200 spectators, we always give our best and with all the heart."
The Circus Probst is open from the 17th to the 20th of September daily at 17 and 20 am.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm.
Thursday is family day, for the presentation at 17: 00 are discounted rates.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am till 6 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, has fallen down from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained forever, but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media.
The opening of Parliament has also been tarnished by statements made by members of the opposition that they would have had anonymous death threats and have been warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with notes.
Last month, they had made it known and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - that is what he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven decision-makers have received SMS messages on their phones, who warned them to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'death', he said journalists to Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members of parliament concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and, once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesperson said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "worried" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the services of the company.
HP will later be divided into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing company hardware and its service business activities.
The expected job losses result in a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who is supposed to lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today, and we have a broad and deepened portfolio of shops to support companies in transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has over 50 billion US turnover and "will be focused on providing unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for companies," said the company.
It splits a company that was founded in the 1930 "s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and whose Palo Alto garage was named" the birthplace of Silicon Valley. "
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action of HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US-Tech companies, is the latest in this field, which is based on the conviction that narrowly focused companies perform better.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that team mates have to face the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the wounded Jack Wilshere.
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England, and in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is still uncertain.
The big shame on this current issue is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then recovered to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It is a bone that does not heal.
That is not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his or her tongues or the injuries he had previously had.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier injuries Ltd. has 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of arsenals of 157 league matches in the last five times.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight games since 2007 / 08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the vulnerability ratio during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from a breach, you have a due period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome it.
I hope his body stabilises, I'm confident he will do it and he will undergo a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger will be a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players who need to give a little respite," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite, passing through Group F, the Maksime Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most important ways of intimidation in Europe.
Dynamo is also available after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign started in the last season.
The stadium was hit by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with 3.2 being measured on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal pulled the lesson of the last season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco, and remains of the far-sighted hope to lead the club into its first Euro-Cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked out.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other side I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamer.
FriendsFest: The comedy show, which gives us serious lessons about male friendships.
The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up, now even more desperate than ever before, how suicide rates among young men show a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death among men aged between 20 and 45 in the UK, and three times more in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) 2015 as the year of man, with the aim of challenging the culture, preventing men from searching for help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to be friends, so that friendship can work.
In the age of social media, with its focus on style on substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear to be life funny and successful, even if, in reality, isolation is dominated.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychiopic values call them; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship, which has a profound impact on our mental health.
And, like a videogame inventor and billionaire recently, money can really not buy luck.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character is defined not by his work, but by his personality, which by his interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler frequent hugs, moments at the football pitch in comfortable armchairs and the yelling of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can certainly relate to it, even if they often hold to explore whole their emotions.
As one of the staff of the telephone soul, I explained:... "my audience for people who feel depressed and self-disillusioned have really shown me how to make a difference to the smallest interactions of friends."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I come with it" has a huge impact, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly. "

Maria meets, to help PSG to crush Malmö
El Di Maria is celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria hits his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to teach in Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held track when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG-player who brought the French Master on the way, but then lost a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead, when Cavani achieved a headballgate in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk, also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, since they are not just striving for the qualification for the round of Chad, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-final in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, Laurent Blancs's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics lost opportunities in front of the door, later replaced with his hometown team and the club with which he began his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or overseas in the Champions League, so it is a good start to win 2: 0 to cause problems and to be relaxed, even if there are certain things that we need to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"That augurs well.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not reach one or two other goals. "
After his injury to the Paris team, he returned to the first league during the weekend, but he was shot up in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentinean wing has been described as the man who can take the PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month, and he indicated why he was in Marco Verrattis Pass behind Malmö's Defense before he closed to Johan Wiland over the long distance from the network.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would gain a great victory, it was a disappointment.
Malmö, which hit Celtic in a play-off to achieve this stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players in the field, with a five-man defense, and two deep in the middle field, a hard opponent.
But apart from a shot of Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far to Kevin Trapps posts in the 34th minute, they offered little.
Instead, PSG sometimes came up, with some misapprehensions and bad conclusions, not least by yesterday's album, who was killed by no fewer than five trials in the first half, and then abandoned after Cavani had been using it after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he showed much more skill when he put up his players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahim himovic who turned the Di Mary into a shooting shot, passing through Wiland in the 52nd minute on the post...
The second gate finally came down shortly after the hour mark, thanks to Cavani.
That ended all thought that Malmö could come back to play, and only an excellent intervention by Vilnius to stop David Luiz could hold the final result low, before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi found a gate at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, announced later that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegians said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
Qualification games are not enough. "
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!

Xavi: PEP Guardiola prevented 2008 change to the FC Bayern.
Since the summer of 2015, world and European champions Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar
A few years ago, the FC Bayern were faced with the obligation of Spain's superstar Xavi, who then played for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish Champion, three times Cup winner, four Champions League winner, two World World Champion World Champion, a world champion, the title list of Xavi is staggering.
In the summer, the 35-year-old took over the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But, in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now betrays that he already stood before the EURO 2008 before the farewell to Barcelona.
"You told me that Barca wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won us all, we do nothing," he said.
And the registered association of the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
Remember: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi was not changed
The change did not come about, however.
And the leading man for this work today for the German record master: PEP Guardiola.
Xavi explained why: "Barça has come under contract with Guardiola and I have played a great EM."
"PEP told me that I would not switch to the team without myself."
"He's what he got."
Who knows how Bavaria's season of 2008 / 2009 would run into Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against the Bavaria over all distance on the lawn, folded the Red (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated the ultimate class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays a new role in film production.
Matt Damon treated the Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she would not be needed behind the scenes.
As a result of Sunday Night of HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown, when she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, is in reference to a black protagonist in the chosen screenplay of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, then do it with the occupation of the film, and not in the occupation of the Show," said Damon.
"I have to say that I can't say anything about it, but I don't know what to say about it.
Damon and Brown joined the producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show-finalists.
"I would invite people to think about - whoever is always the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony," said Brown.
The only black person, and she is a Nutte who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People opted for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing rights on the film; Damon replied that their direction "at the end could give us something that we do not want."
After the discussion has been aired, the social media exploded against disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter users, Mr Pooni, expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talking about the only black person in space, so he can explain its diversity - that is SO WEISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 Retweets and 4,000 Likes since its release.
Damins's comments come at a time when racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police in 2014, the Movement Black Lives Matter achieved national impact and pushed legislators and authorities to put an end to discriminatory practices against colour.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the motion during the premiere of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Album silently matte," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Movement Black Lives Matter announced a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Network Black Lives Matter is a love group," said the guide.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted or has taken the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior's first Champion
The first athlete, who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening, and took the real prize of $1 million, was the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening.
The competition show, which just finished her 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season, there were two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, until the final.
For the last task, climbing at a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
At the end of the first athlete, he was the first athlete to finish the challenging phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero made this challenge a full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the $1 Million Grand Prize.
"I think it is amazing to think about it, I have never had to earn more than $10,000 or to live," said Isaac E, about his bunch of money.
So suddenly.. like I can not even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed set up with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final, and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not get any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"When there are more than one finalists, it gets the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and the life changed, he gets the great gracing.
I do not think he has any resentment about that.
He is so happy with what he has done.
Masses of awards he received from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I have to be beaten by someone, I am glad that Isaac is."
And I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had swapped the reels.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit's Tiger Later of Minnesota Twins over.
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously, they used to be one of the best teams in baseball, and today the tiger is the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers have been reduced to their role as spoilers, but this part played against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted an opportunity to rise in a game half of Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard.
For Detroit, if only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word which was so hard to reach for a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories make fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support, when Detroit ranked three times in the first two sessions, then once again in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) beat 6 times in 1 / 3 Innings and allowed three Runs.
It was only his third successful start in his final nine matches.
"I will end this year strongly," said Simon.
It is difficult to throw any game in the bullpen, and so I want to focus very strongly on the game.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two Runs, his first long since mid of August.
It was the first three-episode game from Martinez, since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He has melts," he said.
He looked good at (jumping training), looked much better out of the Bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three Runs at the end of the seventh Innings, the Twins have had their best chance to come back to play.
The Counts of the Byron Buxton finished the Inning with a double on the left line.
Right in the direction of Aaron Hicks, Simon took his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the Strikeout, before he was replaced by the left wing Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran a wall, the only man with whom he was faced, faced with the Rookie drummer, Miguel Sano, who tore a two-run suit to the right wing Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run for the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a Double Play.
It was in the major league leader 27 times during this season, that Plouffe had a Double Play beat
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth Innings, a Wall created a RBI double against the Closer of the Tiger Bruce Rondon and scored 5-4.
However, the right margin of Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited for the start of the game of an unmovable Phil Hughes.
The Tigers made three of us in the first two sessions against the righthwing veterans who had been removed from the injury list before the game, having lost more than one month due to a backrest.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted to see," said Hughes, "but I felt better than I got and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches in third place."
After they were first to receive the Leadoff-Batter, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A 2-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play with a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the Runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to go to the third, ending the threat.
The tiger was in the second, reaching a one-out Double of Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from the Center-Field-Field-Field of Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins's manager Paul Molitor.
He has not done a particularly good job, but he has caught the right place.
Hughes was in a Pitch-Count, scored no points in the third Inning before he was replaced by the ever-ever legal court A.J.Achter.
In the case of Hughes, there were six hits and a four strikeout walk.
Comments: Tiger RHP Anibal Sanchez declined due to injury of the breeders.
He is studied by Dr. James Andrews who operated on the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid of August on the vulnerability list because of a shoulder gradient, will be activated for the launch on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is deleted from the injury list to start against the Twins.

He has been absent since August 20 because of a rage in the right hip.
The Tiger and the Twins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play with Mino's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73).

The Federal Government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel, at the late Tuesday evening, announced almost four-year consultations with the Prime Minister in Berlin.
Merkel emphasized those who needed protection would get that too.
But those who do not have a lead perspective could not stay in Germany either.
This view has been strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor pointed out that the state as a whole must now cope with a "tremendous effort."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now firmly on the road to the Balkan route.

Although the pigeon movement is small but nevertheless too large for a permanent body of celestial bodies, it is stated in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State of New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the paper "Icarus."
For a long time, it was known that the ice cover of Enceladus fluid had to be water.

At least at the south pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified.

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square.
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin-Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of city President Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday, a nameless space in the park on the Oppio Hill was baptized on the name of the German reformator.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero," he is now recognized as the "German theologian of the Reformation."
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Coliseum.
The name was requested by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, remembered Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the pope over the centuries as a minority were often only in hiding in the secret their faith.
With this place, it is symbolic to see that their tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) held a number of months in Rome for the turn of the year 1510 / 11.
At the time, he felt that the city was a fancy scapegoat.
His negative impressions, according to historians, may have been reinforced in his later struggle against Rome.
At the end of the 19th century, he was buried at the end of the 19th century.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) Dornenkrone is one of the main works which Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated biblical texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which is now with magnificent images.
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, which in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colours and imaginative forms has received the 75-year-old - but certainly does not mean "funny" images.
On the contrary, it may be quite bleak.
About three years Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective artistic choice from the many areas covered by the book "Book of all books."
These are a series of cycles that focus on subjects such as cross-roads, posts, bids or faour.
As a result, he has been fascinated by several partners spontaneously: This applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who has studied painting with the respective Bible.
He has interpreted the Bible from Otmar Alt and translated it into today, translated into current contexts.
These texts are as verbals of Alts painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quotation from Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist who presents his very personal ideas about the respective situation here.
The jewelry book has golden lettering.
So the 75-year-old allows for twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
That is a great deal of privacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode, born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter-Order.
"As it happened with the pipe," Otmar Alt remembers.
"I tried to work on it, so that I could perhaps meet with my father again."
His second concern is to restore the art in the near future: "The perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is being squeezed out.
Artists have a different desire and gloom to show things.
Pictures have always something secret and they are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to get into the images "fall into it," discover them, discover and feel the power they have: "The image looks for its counterpart."
Klaus Altepost advised on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "always" a lover of Otmar Alts art had been to be "I like watching his images."
Old people didn't care to capture the Bible in full, but the most important, mysterious themes that were selected for him.
"It wasn't working on an equal footing," says Altepost: "Here we are talking about the pictures, the text just described."
For Hans Möhler of Luther's book, this work is an invitation to deepen his life and to find freedom. "
Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love as well as that of responsibility.
A portion of the originals - paper and tile paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on November 15th in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Building commencement for BMX Railway seam
Plans made, finding space, hired companies to model the earth's guard for a round course: One year later, almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn was already ending.
Negligence in politics and administration gave rise to resentment, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railways.
So we looked for a hill, looking for new space - now with formal planning and application for building permission.
In October, the first local councillor, Sabine Mosebach, could now communicate to the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should be started without a "memorial pause" with the work of the former indoor swimming pool.
DFB is going to step up engagement with refugees
The DFB will extend its commitment to refugees until 2019, leaving the Bundesliga a clear signal at the weekend.
Football responds to the growing situation in Germany and ensures that policy is helping to deal with the problems we face.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"There is nothing I can say about this in principle, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must be of interest to everyone interested in getting to grips with this subject," said DFB-chief Wolfgang Rensbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, on 23 September, he will be discussing the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am coming to the chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister for Foreign Affairs Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor.
"The topic will certainly play a central role," he said.
Football could and should help.
The crucial crossroads, however, must be the policy.
Therefore, the German Football Federation has extended its Refugee Initiative "1: 0 for a Welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius-Braun-Foundation we have ensured that this program will be continuing through 2019," said kidney sbach at the fringes of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's / Malta.
Some of the Federal Chairs also support this programme.
At the end of this weekend, the 36 professional groups will send a strong signal if they will wear on the left hand panel instead of the otherwise usual sponsor (Hermes) the printing "We will help #.
"We want to make it clear that everyone is supposed to help where and how they can only" said Leverkusens champion Rudi Völler the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "self-evident."
"The refugee drama affects everyone, no one should see the eye."
"We could not, no, we must use our power, our influence and our ways to help the many refugees who have already suffered so badly," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Henthheims Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."
On this Friday, the national team will welcome 100 refugees to Halle / Saale.
He described the support of refugees as "a great collaborative work for German football."
That all 36 license associations had started their own projects in their places is great.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active.
The message "1: 0 for a Welcome," which we spent, is being lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next year, together with the DFB selection and the federal government, the Association will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already retrieved the whole sum for 2015," said kidney sbach.
Reports: SAP Head of Management loses an eye on an accident in the event of an accident.
The CEO of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, said several reports that by late July, the left eye lost sight of the left eye.
In the case of the accident at the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA, after midnight he would have fallen to a waterglass he held in the left hand, reports the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He is almost avowed, was powerless, then moved out to the road - as he told us so last week," quoted the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott, however, could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet at the meeting of the Board of Directors in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year old manager is at the meeting and "fully operational."
McDermott announced an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition), he will come to Germany again in October and continue the software company.
"I am full for SAP, full in my job."
"Of course I always had regular contact with the supervisory board and its chairman Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ."
McDermott usually oscillates between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important to get to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can do something about it."
"It's important to be back if you like it."
Jenson Button is the first to win the Grand Prix for the first time...
Pyrotechnics twitted a photo and explained that he suffered injuries when he was overthrown by the wheel.
As a result, he will have to go back to Singapore at the weekend just as much as a reserve driver for the two Chief Cards of Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BvB without Reus at Krasnodar: Weidenfeller im Tor
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback from Marco Reus in the first group of the European League will finally be broken.
At the end of September, the tournament will be held at the end of September.
"We cannot rely on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
When Reus will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Leverkusen, the BVB-Coach will be open: "We are counting on a return from him to practice on Friday."
Due to the high load of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his trunk to the Reus position.
So he announced a change on the goalkeeper's position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of master keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trained on an absolute top level," the soccer teacher praised the world champion.
Nevertheless, Tuchel was open to play in all of Europe's League matches in the future.
With a high probability, he will also play the second game.
If you have any questions or questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Robot cars: Government wants to lead the way for Germany.
Germany, according to the Federal Government, is supposed to be the leader in the transformation of the car technology pioneer.
The Bundeskabinett decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the Chamber of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, provides investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Automesse IAA of a "new mobility age."
Automatic and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss this issue with his colleagues from the G7, which will also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The Transport Ministry's strategy document emphasises, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid shift in digital radio.
For testing new technology, a test route is currently underway on the 9 in Bavaria.
In order to avoid additional liability risks for the driver, the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework and to adapt to the new developments where necessary.
Germany, for example, wants to make an international effort to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-sustaining cars from 10 to 130 km per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to commit itself to amending the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for man as a driver.
In automatic driving, the car becomes more and more important, the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras, which capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry for Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nonetheless, driver-free vehicles on public roads are to be expected far beyond 2020.
For 2025, the value of added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions of Germany is estimated at around EUR 8.4 billion.
"The digital networking of passenger cars may lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said the Social Democrats Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the case of accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
Yet the German self-sustaining cars still see scepticism - much more than French or Americans.
A survey carried out on the AA from the Forsa Institute, commissioned by the Forsa Institute, on behalf of the Forsa Institute, will come to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years, 32 percent will only grow in 20 years, and 31% will not believe at all in the first place.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect self-powered cars to 2025, and 33% in the United States.
Anyway, car drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-sustaining vehicle.
Following a survey by the Digital Federation Bitkom, only seven per cent agree to give control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, however, the traffic could reach 15 percent, in the Stau 45 percent.
Every fourth would not leave the car to control under any circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis-EM.
From September 25 to 4, 2009, the exhibition will take place in Düsseldorf from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision should be taken at the latest on 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The guys have heard it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title without Timo," said German singer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM-course in Düsseldorf.
At that time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term sponsorship opportunity in China.
The 34 year old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo is the drawback, we are now no longer such a clear favorite," said single-European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner who leads the list in Jekaterinburg, but also remembered the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time Timo was also missing, and we became European champion."
"We should be guided by it," said the world's fourth-fifth person.
The British football player, Luke Shaw of Manchester United, has attacked a serious injury at the right leg.
During the Champions League match at the PSV Eindhoven, the defender was taken with a Tackling by Héctor Moreno and changed after a long time.
The first diagnosis, during the 20-year-old players of Bastian swine fever, indicated a rail crash.
Gaultier feels too old to be an Enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figure poem: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition of his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlight: Shop window window, which, thanks to video projections, look alarmingly humane.
They play the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among others, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonnas's stage outfits - and by that he put men in Röcke.
"I can no longer say today that I am the Enfant terrible of Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"Earlier it was easy, now it's real," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo Cultural Foundation, it is a good thing that the fashion maker is changing his initial opposition to a show about his person.
Actually he was against, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
If you die, you come to the Museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris.
"It's about so much more than beautiful dresses," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and a vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever thought-out work of man, who wrote fashion history, without ever trained.
Chronologically the show is not built, but it is a perfectly choreographed whole artwork, for which a lot of effort has been done: To chew the dolls, for example, a stylist has been involved.
14 tons of material, according to the principles of the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
In front of the start of the Oktoberfest, there is still a special delicacy: A leather pants outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, said Gaultier.
Also Gaultiers old teddy is visible in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, timid fashion designer of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good pupil and bad in football) he attracted his Teddy BHs and dresses, said Gaultier.
Playing a doll would not have allowed his parents to play.
At the end of this year, he was invited to play for the first time in the first half of the 20th century.
He steel fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, such as Gaultier in Munich.
Later I bought it, of course, but I bought it.
He won't be able to pay the models for his first own fashion show.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Speaking Top as Mode-Nic
In the past it was on the long embroidery machines in and around chat about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were produced in large quantities for customers, which they were further processed, for example, in ceilings and curtains.
That alone no longer works, Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the Modespushers.
Instead, fashion is again important.
In the early days of the conversation to play mode a larger role, it was then ousted by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt presents some examples: Lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
At the same time, the so-called vintage fashion, which is associated with past Stilepochen, is an increasing number of potential.
Those who do not use niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already represent half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies in the industry, they will be chatting with nine other companies in the industry of conversation and embroidery.
Only they can wear the protected label.
Over the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have been broken.
Private businesses and wholesale companies almost no longer exist.
Our products are difficult to reach by customers in this way.
Today, mass commodity is produced much cheaper in Asia and sold almost exclusively via chains.
Moreover, there is a weakening of exports, up to now to Russia and the United States.
So there are enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to find out about environmental awareness, such as Cordula Bauer by the embroidery perle in Falkenstein: "This year we have been carrying out a quality label that shows that we are environmentally and socially compatible."
Reinhardt supplements: "This also applies to the materials used."
Diploma Designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the WestSaxon University of Applied Sciences Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - specializing in embroidery and lace.
To counter competition from the Asian region, we have to find high quality and innovative products.
That will take time and courage.
There is an area of tension between the best ideas of the designers and the companies, who have to think above all economically, "says Schmidt.
Therefore an existing design often varies easily to hold a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter relaunched the historic snowball head.
In doing so, the machine is stalling small chests in a few places.
The famous goldsmith in Bianca Hallebach-Kraule was inspired: "I couldn't start with traditional conversation."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewellery.
In an elaborate procedure, she shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of chat - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - mostly to customers whose ancestors have lived in conversation and living areas and want to have a souvenir.
In this way, I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the conversation.
Disney plans for new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends should not be touched, but Disney still dares to start a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins."
But, according to "Entertainment Weekly", "Entertainment Weekly" is not a new version of the story, but a kind of sequel, 20 years after the first movie with the magical nanny.
It is about the experiences of the Nanny with the Group's Banks in times of global economic crisis in England.
Anyone who plays Poppin for more than 50 years is still unclear.
But the director is already sure: Rob Marshall, most recently with Into the Woods in the cinema.
XI Much to open the world wider to the world.
The economy needs to open wider to the outside to foster growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday to a group charged with steering the reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign investment and know-how and to improve management strategies," he said, in a speech at the 16th Session of the Central Leadership Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Setting new start-ups and pushing ahead with reforms will bring new momentum and vitality, and provide new ground for economic growth, said Xi.
The leadership group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulating market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), raising private capital, and overhaul of the population reporting system.
Following the statement, a negative list will be produced, which identifies sectors and companies which are not eligible for investment.
The system will be tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it provides the market with a greater role in allocating resources, guaranteeing a rule-of-law business environment and more open to the market, said the statement.
The government will also ease controls over the powers transferred to the companies, and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
Within the scope of an offer to open up state-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
"The government will not change its policy vis-à-vis foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged businesses and provide better services to them," said the statement.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing requirements and simplifying the application process.
To guarantee the right of lawyers to carry out their work and to employ professional judges and prosecutors has also been discussed at one meeting.
The meeting also attended Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double the mercury limit in predators.
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve yields.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working document from the EU, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and side-effects of the industrial and environmental policies are passed with full force of pregnant women and toddlers," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Krugman, the limit values of the nerve poisoning for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or sword fish for economic reasons, will be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
Major predators have, however, already burdened themselves with mercury today that about 50% of catches should not be sold on the basis of the current ceilings.
If the limit values were doubled, then only 14.5% would be uncompromisable.
In exchange for this easing, the EU wants, according to Foodwatch, to tighten limits on other fish from now 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
FoodWatch, however, called this "trick," because smaller gravefish, such as carps, tend to be so low that they are already complying with the planned peak levels.
The reduction in the small-scale reduction is therefore "a perfile reaction that helps the economy alone," explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which feeds heavily into predators over the food chain.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already small amounts of unborn infants are especially able to cause damage to the nervous system."
The Federal Ministry of Environment says on his homepage with regard to the current maximum levels, but that a "health threat to the general population" is not expected.
Mercury is mainly due to the use of coal combustion into the environment.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal-fired power stations, Annalena Baerbock, face more than six tonnes of mercury per year.
The concentration of mercury in fish for example in the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube is "permanently and permanently exceeded," the "mirror" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings from mercury were already among the most widely reported health risks in the EU's alert system RASFF.
