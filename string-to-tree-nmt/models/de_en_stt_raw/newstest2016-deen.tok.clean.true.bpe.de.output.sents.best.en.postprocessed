Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very amicable.
The two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement, as well as about Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also have to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution that has been discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's continuing settlement of settlements and raises Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
Obama's bid for Iran's nuclear program has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, partly being viewed as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not discussed with Obama, and a meeting had rejected it with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel.
In a distress call, a professor admits that his girlfriend was shot dead.
In a distress call, Professor Shannon Lamb talked to the police with a rather angry voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasise that his "sweet dog" is still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of dead women could be found on the phone.
Within the house, officials found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten notice that was tied to a white block: "I'm sorry, I want it to be, I could undo it, love Amy and is the only woman who ever loved me." That was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb
There was no indication that Lamb, who was taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi,, had already spent 300 miles on the school grounds, where, according to the police, he was shot and killed by a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, by the police, at the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief, Lynn Buford, said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10: 18.
He said that lamb has made the fateful emergency call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day, there was another death.
A day after the shootings in the university that forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said that they were happy with their lessons.
The police in Gautier, where she died, said that he has no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a written book in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both of them were in the Department of Social Sciences and History, the teachers included 17 members, and many students visited courses of both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations about problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that lamb told him that he had stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and told that he had some health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard would not provide him with a guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an Assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said that he knows nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Of course there was something in Mr Lambs."
These are questions that lamb can no longer answer.
After a flight from the campus, the police later found Lambs" trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, lamb sacked herself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of its parent home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car still ran in the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew in the area.
Lamb started in 2009 its work at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his PhD in Pedagogy in the spring.
One of the longtime girlfriends called him to be intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said that she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by common friends.
They and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach the guitar to her.
He was at the time of women-friendly.
All girls are resident when they were there," said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency call lamb "I have killed my wife," but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which bordered to a Bait of Gautier.
The police said that the dog was OK.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but friends had remained and had a daughter who was 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed," said O'Steen of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said that he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both on a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played together one thing or another.
O'Steen said that his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for several companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night 5th September for the last time, after lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmonica, ended prior to a sparse audience.
There was no indication that something was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and smelling of one another.
I think they had a good sense of shame.
Schmidt, the dead professor, headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On Tuesday night, at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students, and members of the community, participated in a candle light commemoration ceremony.
Schmidts Frau Liz and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also participated in the memorial guard, during the "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" that was performed at the "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Lessons are resumed on Wednesday.
"We try to move our students to move back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The associated press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect the fact that the police are now saying that lamb made the emergency after he had shot Schmidt, and the Lamb, who was named Prentiss as his wife in his emergency call, did not indicate that the two had ever married.
Toys R Us plans to recruit fewer workers for the Christmas season.
Toys R Us says that it will not have so many Christmas staff as it is last year, but the toy and baby product vendor says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to recruit 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it will start with interviews this month and the number of staff is from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to provide shops with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "Date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great time for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were waiting in the theater to wait for the royalty, and I realize that the seat is empty next to me, and it will gradually tell me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simulated pot and an arm length of it to be with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" was premiered 30 years ago.
"It really is for me," said Spielberg, "the greatest time of travel has ever been filmed."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD, and selected cinemas in October.
UN boss says that there is no military solution in Syria.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia strengthened military support for Syria: "There is no military solution" of almost five years of conflict, and more weapons will only make violence and poverty worse for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiation to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the Council's five permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France - at the margins of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation impossible."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran, in response to the crisis in Syria.
8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But, as some Republicans are trying to pull down Donald Trump from the top ranks of polls, it has not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump in the double-digit area, and some are beginning to ask themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate.
Of course, it is too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump will likely win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at that time, in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was delivered to the rising Herman Cain, none of which won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he should have fought for a general election.
But outsiders, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC, and the conservative economic group Club for Growth, now recognize Trump's resilience and begin to flow their dollar.
Here are some recent poll numbers, which suggest that the real estate Mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity ratings have been turned by 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll by the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40%.
In early August it was 52%.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are reflected in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa found last week that 60% of the Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters, GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN poll last week, 67% of the Republicans said that they would either be "enthusiastic" or "happy" when Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say that they would be "angry" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates the same enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they were "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent, who say the same about Trump).
The Next in Love?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they are "unsatisfied" or "upset" when Jeb Bush, the recipient's favourite, would be the candidate.
A majority of the Republicans see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for its bombastic and offensive statements, 52% of Irish voters believe that the real estate Mogul has the right temperament for a president, as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies to the first pre-electoral state of the nation, the city of Iowa, where the same 52% of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44% think that he has no personality to carry out his job effectively, and almost six out of 10 say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, ABC / Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set their vow, Republican voters are holding Trump for real purposes.
When they are asked who best wins the GOP nomination, following a CNN poll from last week, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This has been a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination only 28% for the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
Yet it is apparent that a large number of GOP voters regard Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gather for another candidate, Trump beats almost all.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is spread over a dozen of other candidates.
But a poll by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina 13 points, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have formed their views.
A new CBS /NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have cast their votes.
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one really can say to never change the opinion.
46% said that they leave the door open to move to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competitor at the moment of the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their minds, are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they are in tune with Trump on the subject of immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump was calling immigrants from Mexico "rapists" two months ago, immigration was the lynchpin of public discourse at 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep Hispian-Americans remote from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC / Post poll of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they are in line with Trump on questions of immigration.
So, as long as immigration remains in the limelight, it seems to be Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government is rising to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday-poll of ABC/Post, that they rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also furious at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, with 54% "dissatisfied" and 21% "hellish anger."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany.
Here in Hobookenweg you will find the most expensive residential complex with views of the North Sea.
On the street, a square metre of a building of a roof costs 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects by nature is limited," says the study - that is to say the high price.
A new study shows in which particular areas of a square metre cost the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square metre for a student bude in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top places, one of the price, however, is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of Germany's most exclusive locations - with square prices at a dizzying peak.
There are several tens of thousands of euros per square metre, no doubt.
But well, those who can afford it can...
Munich, for once, is not at the forefront.
Champions League: Bavaria-dream start start thanks to Müller and Götze.
There are two reasons why Thomas Müller has just run a course in Piraeus.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to a 3: 0 at Olympiakos Piraeus.
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season.
The world champions, Thomas Müller and Mario Götze, have launched a dream start to the "Mission Milan" to the FC Bayern in the witch-seat of Piraeus.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won the game of action in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympic Games in hot atmosphere, thanks to Müller's double pack (52/90/90/90) and idols (89th) with 3: 0 (0: 0).
The twelfth victory in the series is supposed to be the first step in the direction of the final of 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.
At the age of 28, Müller received his 28th hits in the Champions League for the Bavaria leadership by Olympic champion Roberto, who was allowed to pass a battle of the world champion.
"We will not underestimate them," said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm before the match in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31.688 hottest fans - and the Munich.
They showed a focused and dedicated vision without being shining.
Piraeus won its most recent six home matches in the premier class, including well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid, or Juventus Turin.
In 2011 stumbled here Borussia Dortmund (1: 3).
But the Bavarians, who undefeated seven Europacup with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were brave, but in their offensive efforts, however, they were often unimaginative to works.
The attacks were too often started by relocation to left-wing Douglas Costa, who rarely escaped the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck than his flank from the right-hand margin on the left upper toreck.
In the 67th minute the champion gave the possible 2: 0.
The best opportunities were half of one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat Poland's head of the line (26).
Then by direct payment, the goalkeeper Roberto parsed with the knee (35).
Although Bavaria used to take up the dominant game, Piraeus was able to have conifers.
However, it was time to let Manuel New go.
Thus, when he shot a shot of Ideye over the bar (56th).
Before New, let Guardiola defend a four-shot chain with David Alaba in the centre of Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after critical problems back in the Kader, was first sitting outside.
The World Cup hero has only been given the green light after the final training session, Sports Officer Matthias Sammer said at "Sky. "Those who want to make something other of it are evil already.
Also during the first transition, Guardiola decided to fight against him, when he brought Kingsley Coman to the damaged Lewandowski (59th).
Idols came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it clear.
Prior to the game, there was a tie in the stadium.
After a small group of some of the Bayern fans, who were partly covered, had apparently provoked supporters of Piraeus's supporters with words and gestures, the security forces attacked the security forces and attacked the supporters of Munich.
At least one Bavaria fan was transported out of the stadium.
Anyone who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth.
Anyone who smokes is damaging not only the lungs, but also the teeth - that is what a Potsdam long-term study suggests.
The good news: When you do not lose the risk, you will lose the risk.
Smokers have a considerably increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This emerges from the long-term study of an international research team, including several staff at the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In comparison to non-smokers, smokers had the risk of losing their teeth early in order to lose the 2.5- to 3.6.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gum, the DIfE (DIFE).
For these parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors.
The connection between smoking and loss thus goes back to more frequent gum infections for smokers.
It would not be possible to clarify the extent to which smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stopped smoking but could reduce their risk within a short time write the researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research."
However, it may take more than ten years until the vulnerability has returned to the level of non-smokers, explained Erstautor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
People need to be convinced to be non-smokers, Heiner Boeing from DIfE explained that "Smoking is shortening life."
It is good to smoke for lungs and vessels, and according to our findings also leads to a good tooth health to old age.
In Germany, more than 20% of the population aged 65 to 74 years of toothlessness has been divided by the DIFE.
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study will be substantiated by the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains of late antiquity on Cologne's Rhine.
Once again, archaeological discoveries have been made on the right bank of the Rhine on the right bank of the Rhine.
Archaeologists have dug the skeletons and remnants of historical buildings close to the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, the museum manager Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the building work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called land monuments.
The museum is always consulted as a treasurer for all projects in the municipal district of Cologne.
In the third part of the Rheinboua, archaeologists have now found what they are looking for.
Although it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress had stood a church in the 4th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs, which belonged to the church, was also discovered.
Young Woman Collected by Freight
After a young woman has been lost at the railway station in Geilenkirchen, the Federal Police are asking the people to help.
At the end of the railway, the woman crossed the track at the end of the railway station and was covered by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
As a result of the capture of the train, the Federal Police reported that it had heaviest injuries to it.
She was treated on the spot by a doctor, and she was taken to a hospital by rescuers.
As a result of the nocturnal crossing of the young woman, there is no evidence of the officials who are appointed.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents and passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Street (L364) are coming into question.
References that provide information about the cause of the accident can be provided under 24 hours and a free hotline of the Federal Police by telephone 0800/6888,000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes in dispute over TTIP new court
To defuse the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The disputed private dispute settlement bodies are thus supposed to be replaced by a more transparent system, which is much more traditional in its operation.
"We want to set up a system that is trusted by the citizens," said the competent EU Commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, at the presentation.
The Swede proposes that the proposal be presented as a European negotiating position to the free trade talks with the United States.
The German Government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration procedures specifically indicate that the EU countries and the US collectively choose independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to come from the same parts of the EU, the United States and third countries.
A second instance is planned for the first time.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
Until now, the parties to the procedures have agreed amongst themselves on referees, the possibility of having recourse to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past few months, it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old ISDS system of fairness and equity, commented Malmström.
In the long term, it intends to pursue its own information on an international investment court.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could, for example, be clarified.
The investor state arbitration procedures (ISDS), mainly demanded by large corporations, are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major opposition in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, who can get damages to taxpayers at the expense of the taxpayer, negotiate national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations, such as Campact, identify the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate.
The main criticism was that they should not be applied to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
On the other hand, the German economic secretary, Matthias Machnig (SPD), described the plans as great progress.
The Commission has taken account of key issues, the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbiters is off the table.
The French Government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European corporate association warned against restricting the economy's ability to deal with too many new rules.
Particularly small and medium-sized enterprises could be put at a disadvantage if they were to be put at a disadvantage.
When talks about the FTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) trade agreement could be completed, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been in progress since the middle of 2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, there should be a framework for the agreement at the end of this year.
This deadline is considered to be no longer valid.
Delicious folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg.
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was sitting on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
In addition to it there is a flipchart to which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a pencil.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens.
He tells on the basis of various places that he finds out again and again on the map, about which he reports songs that have been arranged in minute detail.
Where they came into being and how they look in their homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative madman.
With the 2003 published and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," songs that are composed wisely are harmoniously close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulente at all times.
There are rumors that "Michigan" would be the first part of a twisted series: Each of the 50 US states should be brought in.
However, already in 2004 and Rheinnear, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and is breaking some expectations.
Stevens here will be reduced.
Live is enough for him in the guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York musician returns to the series.
With the "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), 2005 is a masterpiece celebrated in 2005.
Overwhelmed by ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album is rising to the American Billboard charts and is missing in any list of influential music media.
After very productive experiments, Stevens, "The Age of Adz" (2010), uses very large pieces in electronic copies.
This sixth sound studio album is still orchestrated by programmed sequences and beats, and plays with all sorts of effects and reverence.
A long time ago the smaller clubs got up, the stage shows here to the colourful spectacle of Neon headband and large fluorescent stage deko.
Currently, Sufy Stevens is part of a five-member volume by Germany.
In the dark, Hamburg added more!
Theater mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" that has been available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are now locked in their seats, the much mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the public, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
The audience can hear that the lecture is "opulent" and you can thus throw away the "hard disk."
First of all, Stevens would like to thank him.
Jeremy Corbyns's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbett's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time is expected to be eagerly awaited.
The new Labour president Jeremy Corbyn is going to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and set himself up with David Cameron for the first time.
MR Corbyn will rise to ask the first of its six fixed questions shortly after noon, with its power being examined by the media probably and by Labour MEPs.
He called for "fewer theatres and more facts" for this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Corbyns's leadership, because they come after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the Tuc Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, Labour's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is at the heart of several pages of headlines in the newspapers.
MR Corbyns's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman by Mr Corbyn said that he had "in respectful silence" and that he recognized "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air around England."
But a member of Mr Corbyns's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he advised Labour leaders to sing the national anthem, "independently" by his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they claim differences in the economy, defense and foreign policy, while fewer than one of the six of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also within Labour, following Mr Corbett's comments about the position of the European Union and the limit on profits.
MR Corbyn said of the Tuc conference, that Labour put changes to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow working and pensions minister, said that the party "is very clear," that they are only opposed to the government plans, to reduce the limitation of £26000 to £23000.
MR Corbyn will be the fifth Labour president who, since he was Tory head, David Cameron has been facing the Dispatch Box in Parliament over the last decade.
The Labour leader, who promised a different policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced," ideas for questions to Mr Cameron, and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is confrontational, and that he will refrain from "spirited" and by the strident, and that he has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges for young people.
MR Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not take part, for example when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also mentioned the idea that other Members occasionally take the floor and mention John Bercow, the Speaker of the Lower House, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Pyramid" theater, which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question, but a few years later he admitted that he failed to do so.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time to the Prime Minister, as the main barometer of the judgment of a leader and his position in the House of Commons,, despite its position among its fellow Members, although critics argued that it had become a caricature, needed far-reaching reforms.
Shot in Joburg: Homeless people trained to photographers.
The centre of Johannesburg is a tough place to be left homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg), it is a charity that teaches young people how to capture photos from their environment and gain a profit from them.

The pound rises by accelerating wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound soared to data that show a rise in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was increased by the bid of SABMiller.
Between May and July, the result grew by 2.9% in the UK compared with the same period last year, without bonuses in the United Kingdom.
This percentage has been the fastest and most effective rate since 2009 about the date of an increase in interest rates.
The pound increased by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1.5505 and was climbed to 1.3730 by 0.84% against the euro.
The FTSE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229,21.
SABMiller was the most prominent share on the market and made a 20% jump after receiving the rival of AB.
A transaction would combine the two biggest breweries of the world and bring brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news of the competitor for luxury goods.
Richemonts's latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that China's sales - a key market for Burberry - have returned growth.
Glencore stocks increased by 5% after Bergbauriese said that it had taken USD 2.5 billion by selling a stock as part of its strategy of debt reduction.
The shares of Mondi, the packaging and paper segment, were the biggest losers on the index, with a 4.3% decline, after Goldman Sachs had set to "sell" its rating for the firm rating.
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million over the previous six months.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for the UK workforce "could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the rise in labor costs in its company.
The cost could be the expansion plans of JD Sports, it added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin bending in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin.
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
It's 21 years old, a hanging object with a touch of upper hand.
The type with the platinblonden hair is EUR 100 million.
It is more than that.
Currently, Monsieur Bieber is bending in Berlin.
And the Generation U17 rotates through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15 year old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
It is not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
However, since 7 a.m. in the morning, the upholstery sits on the cold stone plates shape Berlin luxury at Potsdamer Platz.
The bending structure: Here lives her idol, whose posters hang in Szczecin, since Monday night.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives, on the day costs exactly as much as their mwa Ewa earns half a year.
If at all.
It says: "In fact, my Wiktoria in the 10th class should sit in high school."
"I fulfil your dream."
Should they be required to do so?
Who to juge?
The fans do not.
Even bending of itself does not.
It has already done so anyway.
For the advertising in the advertising break of the super strike, he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company washing many, many dollars on the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like it is going on the ladder, Bieber also receives.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're amazed at the window pane.
It is supposed to have more than 100 million it exploits.
Some say that the hype goes too far.
Others emphasize that bending is ultimately in the United States and the United Kingdom with its new single "What do you mean?"
Bending itself, which should follow its fourth album in November, the many zeros do not interest first.
At least that is what he is doing.
Pegida brings Lebanese to the idea of potato döner.
Potatoes, or Döner?
It's both the potato döner, which the Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the phrase "potatoes instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potatoes and meat together on a spun.
The idea came to him with a poster of a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of Döner," which he accidentally had on television.
Since then, in his shop, there has been a barbecue stocked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multikulti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea is that the Lebanese now have to be registered with the Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to information from the agency, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Alhay does not want to betray the amount of meat and potatoes that it contains.
"It tastes better together," he finds.
Culinary traditions are also good at its customers.
Metcash launches Strategy's campaign to combat Aldi-
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an announcement in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a campaign of land to defend the IGA retailer's market share in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA-supermarkets strengthen their ties with local food suppliers and build the brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as events like Adelaide.
IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Ice Manufacturers Simmo from Dunsborough, who are distributed in IGA stores, and shop owners who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler for food, alcohol, and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
Much is at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30% of Metcash's IGA retail outlets and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the eastern states.
Purchasers to South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 percent in South Australia, and 24% in Western Australia, compared to about 14% in the eastern states.
However, like Morgan Stanley, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi's twelve months after the launch of its first markets, around five per cent of the food market in these two countries, will be grabbing away and will take away all existing actors, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA-retailers could lose $360 million per year, and $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in the next year and generate a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in any market.
The loss of food and food, and of the amounts on metcashs of a high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash's market share is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly Aldi and Coles, despite the fact that a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA purchasers are the most.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs's sales in food and food will be 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017, 2.1% in 2018, and a 14% share of the market share by 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to react publicly to the comments by Mr Douglass.
But it is assumed that a director of Metcash has made contact with Mr Douglass last week.
IGAS's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and revenues from Metcashs's food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting the operating deleveraging and the downward pressure on sales and margins.
The wholesale trader, however, is investing more than $150 million to upgrade sales prices with Coles and Woolworths to hundreds of products each week, and to bring IGA-retailers to the improvement of their shops by improving their shops and supplying them with a better selection of private label food.
Metcash chief executive, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and remediation programs are going to grow, and it hopes that, for the first time in 2017, the wholesaler will return to profit growth in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise as a criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Federation, deserves praise as a criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger version of the talented Duos, who is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks,", was in the limelight by the notorious battle of Kyrgyzstan with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifier game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and its opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the referees twice, and Harrison warned: "Waasp should have struck Kyrgyzstan, and I should beat the child."
Finally, when he was last seen how he had crushed a tennis racquet, after a crane stopped a potential US-open victory by Richard Gasquet, Healy's Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in the competition with Sam Groth, around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"One thing that I am rather tired of is the fact that, according to my opinion, Thanasi was caught in the quarrel," Healy said, said Healy.
He has broken a racquet when he lost because of a crane in the US Open, but he is not the first player to have broken a racquet with himself, and I know Thanasi good enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under quite provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think that he deserves much credit.
He has a great team around them, he has a great family around them, and I think that he has been treated a little too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is being respected in the dressing area, he is being respected in the dressing area, he is tough, he is good in form, he is a very stable and mature young boy, whom I think he deserves
Healy also supported the decision not to take account of the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for all, but assures the man of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term part of the team."
"First of all, we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and does not have all the controversies surrounding [Kyrgyzstan]," said Healy.
I think that Nick has made the rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he rises in the eyes of the public and has made some serious mistakes, and he has made some serious mistakes and earned all the criticism that he gets, but we deserve all the criticism that he receives, but we deserve all the criticism that he
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, limits the border, keeps refugees back.
Hungary declared the state of emergency and advised the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, and all of them who tried to get illegally into the country were all in a position to stop the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the line when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's-land and responded to Serbian officials.
The people who had fled violence turned to a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and settled there.
But frustration was rising.
When a police helicopter hounded over them, the migrants ran the rangers "Opening of the border" and arrested insults at the Hungarian on-call police.
Some rejected food and water out of protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said that it was "unacceptable" that migrants should be sent back from Hungary, while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) will be part of the solution, not a collateral damage.
There must be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serb border was not able to agree a common immigration policy a day after the 28-Nations bloc at a point of disagreement in Brussels.
The ministers, however, agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the failed Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that, after the end of the month or the end of the year, the EU countries would agree that the EU countries would include further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
On Tuesday, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not place its hopes on action by Brussels or of its neighbours.
The emergency announced on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could lock up roads and speed up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country also planned to build a barbed wire along its border with Romania in order to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after having a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used to the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and gateway to the European Union for many refugees from Syria, and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the incoming economic migrants are in search of a better life, not war refugees, who are entitled to protection - a view that is very much in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the shameful of the 4-metre (13 feet) high fence, which the government built along the southern border with Serbia, to be a crime.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are saying it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to approve the process of procedure, which is expected to take place next week, but reporters by Associated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs on a daily basis.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country's regional security advisor, said that authorities have invaded 45 people at an attempt to cross the border, while 15 others have penetrated deeper into the country.
They come along by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes in accordance with the new laws.
Authorities are repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a train car with barbed wire to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing of Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of human beings and to force a crowd of people to invade them.
About 20 managed to arrive, but thousands of them stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary.
Electoral 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead to Bernie Sanders in national surveys.
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit margin in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders gains ground to her.
Clinton now has the support of 47% of democratic voters in the pre-election (58% previously), while Sanders is second, at 27% (increase by 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency, gains support for 15% of the pre-election democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion has been determined which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders scored some gains.
Clinton holds a large margin for women and moderates, but these advances have diminished.
Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders has only 5 points here.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has evaporated, and Sanders and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a great deal of head start with the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was double-digit head of the Liberals before Sanders, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in this group.
About half of the primary democratic voters across the country say that they would support Clinton when they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations, and another 15% would only support them because they were the candidate.
Six per cent of them would not support them.
Perhaps it is hardly surprising that Clinton's current supporters, above all, are enthusiastic about it.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton.
While 48% of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate, the most common answer is that it has the correct experience (16%), followed by the notion that it is time that a woman (13%) is a woman (13%), that is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
Approval of dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.
Since the Vice President throws a potential for the presidency, 57% of the pre-election voters want to see him in the race - although one-third believe that it should not do so.
When democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice well before Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to stand for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead will rise to Sanders, from 20 points with Biden to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance to win, but this figure has fallen by 78% last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage to which he views it has risen.
Nevertheless, on the question of what is more important to a candidate, the Democratic electorate call questions about the eligibility of voters.
As in the last month, not a single democrat candidate, or potential candidate for these voters, stands to be deemed unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results on some of the key features of voters in their party's primaries.
Majorities regard Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, with strong leadership.
Biden best cuts across the three candidates from the point of view of honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leader.
Thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many of them say that via Sanders (15%), but 27%.
Democratic voters generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
For all these measurements, about one quarter of the democratic electorate has no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server continue to be asked during the term of office as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are content with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions have not influenced their overall views.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third is happy.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on Clinton's general opinions, even though 36% said that their opinion was getting worse.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is viewed by the voters of her party as honest and trustworthy, this remains a problem for them in general: Only 32% they see them as honest and trustworthy, eight per cent, less than last month, and 15 points since May.
62% of voters do not regard them as an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of the electorate also see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump are given good leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are best cut by honesty.
A majority sees Sanders honestly, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is moving close to a country by country close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump at the latest survey by CBS News / New York Times.
Half of the candidates now account for half of the voters" support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers, with support growing by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in Tuesday's Tuesday poll.
But Carson shot in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson was good with demographic groups and surpassed Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, was defeated by Wisconlike's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen deep, from 10% last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, is 6% on the third place.
The random margin in the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN / ORC poll, which was released last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls - with 19% support for the Republicans, Trump's 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a view to a carson rising last week, Trump found some side slides for the former neuroarthritis, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's belief.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Comfortable bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is now up to 29 degrees.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, it is enough to have a trip to the Mediterranean in order to find even hot water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer goes to the sea: A maximum of 18 degrees has water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, sharing the German Weather Service (DWD).
On the other hand, temperatures in the Mediterranean continue to rise to 29 degrees in the east.
In the Adriatic there are 25 degrees, 23 degrees in France.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a barge college newcomer.
Almost two years after a student died during a victimised ritual at a student link in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, assassinations are filed against five people.
Members of the New Yorker Baruch College Pi Psi Brotherhood attacks Chun "Michael" Deng during September 2013 when he brutally delayed his transportation to the hospital, which helped to kill him, shared the police.
Officials said that he was burdened with a 30-pound full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, and then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital.
However, they had time to change clothes, his symptoms to googs and Andy Meng to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide Utensilia and set the welfare of the Brotherhood fundamentally over that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning at his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added to blunt force injuries on the head, trunk and thighs.
"too many families were destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Dengs family since 1970.
Fratrices and their members must be held to account, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge for the third level of the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassment and education of a criminal association.
"We do not only want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has - officially or unofficial - sanctioned this, we will also draw them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The baruch college has banned the Brotherhood, and the national Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local group.
That will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
The rise in interest rates will rise, and the house will falter, returns on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long that will last and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance at the end.
A recession came within a period of 11 months after the first interest-rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial assets react.
Thus, representatives of the US central bank have said so vehemently that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather to the period needed for normalization.
Indeed, several variables have a role to play.
In the end, however, market participants could see that the excitement about an interest-rate hike may have been exaggerated.
"The first rise of the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US rates to normal levels, but still at too low levels in order to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, that does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here, a look at historical trends is how some aspects of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, anticipation of interest-rate hikes can do things for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset earnings to be blamed for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which perhaps reflects again the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what is happening after the Fed's interest-rate hikes.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14% - on the path to the rise in interest, fairly flat in the 250 days (average profit of 2.6%), then back to the normal status after 500 days, with an average return to the previous six past cycles of 14.4% according to a current analysis that was published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the recovery cycle and begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest-rate hikes often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that had not existed before, and which could accelerate a recession.
It is worth noting that gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the Fed's interest-rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal GDP since 1950 was less than 4.5% since 1950.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect this to continue and expect the Atlanta Fed to expect only 1.5% for the third quarter.
Interest rates on such a fragile economic scene could be risky, let the question "whether it is different this time" said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken stock of the Fed all year round, and all eyes were at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, the Futures Trading is only likely to be 25%.
"In our study, all recovery cycles from 1950 to today in a Super cycle have taken place with an increasing pace of GDP and have been cast in the shadows very quickly after the start of the recovery after the start of the recovery," says the report.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and that is 74 months so far.
The fixed income was also volatile because the market anticipates an interest-rate hike, and the pattern is similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in equity when its strategic course changes.
On bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first up/reduction occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the recovery cycle, bond yields immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise in interest rates will mean that returns between longer and shorter bonds will converge and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often yield better returns in such a climate, though "we are still wary of increasing returns," said Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the promise of more stringent monetary policy.
Short-term interest rates have been rising, recoveries are flat, credit bubbles have expanded, and volatility has risen - all of the market characteristics when the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the larger part of their operations in the US will benefit from raising interest rates and making local products more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes its products more expensive on the global market, as well as financing their debts.
"History shows that quality "tends to react very positively to three months after an initial rate hike," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report to clients.
Companies with a strong balance sheet exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the increases in interest rates in 1994, 1999, and 2004.
Companies with high yields of capital, as well as low volatility in their shares, also exceeded their low quality counterparts by average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is a major problem.
Companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of mere stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers may see gains from higher returns, even if experts disagree how fast that will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham.
The conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station for being "dumbing."
He argues that it is increasingly not enough to be distinguished by commercial rivals.
He also directed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they just imitated The Brits
Parliament's fellow Member, Damien Collins, attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms itself "to Classic FM, claims a leading MP and increases pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private sender does not.
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC bosses that the public service radio station "stupid," increasingly should not be distinguished by its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I use the word "do not like to - but it seems to turn to Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be The Brits only under a different name.
So if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples, to which you only imitate what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director-General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far in front of its commercial competitors when it came to live music and public awareness.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I will never learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works, I really think is important," said he.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work should be done to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production which, during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture, the media and sport, fell under fire to enter commercial rivals on the feet.
Tory MEP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly markant?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George - was produced on a special BBC way.
He added that he wants the company "to find a hit out of our in-house stall" when the next time it started a series of entertainment.
However, he refused to exclude the order of other ranks of The Voice in the future or spend money on the fee payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales grew slower in August, and the Black Friday can be responsible for it.
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago by using mobile phones to shop.
Experts believe that the Black Friday slowed down expenditures in November.
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has drilled, and many of the UK's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new numbers showed only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditures for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000, at just five percent in comparison with the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new numbers showed only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015.
"If you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then this has always been developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales started three years ago, when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
Now, however, this is moving, and we may see that growth is decreasing.
The black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the decline.
Experts believe that buyers are withholding their purchases before this event, which will take place last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of buyers around their computers, the average number of buyers, soared, and caused some traders to run off.
Experts believe that Black Friday, at which the buyer fought for bargain, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that little more than 1 £online was issued out of £5.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made by web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of the people buys clothes and footwear online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury the Mecca with the Kran accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned.
The corpses of 29 dead are driven by Muslims by the streets of Mecca.
Saudi Arabia imposes part of the collapse of part of the huge Saudian Bin Laden group
The Department of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were driven by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed at Mekkas's Great Mojee.
While they were largely dressed in white, the route to show their respect, when the first of the dead entered their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession passed at the holy place, where a construction crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the end.
The corpses were released for the funeral, when the Saudi King imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden construction company because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 people, who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Moschee Mekkas, were carried away by the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to the crane.
MR Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddsh at the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly agreed that the hijab to Mecca with thousands of people left for the city will continue.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin Laden group should not have turned the arm of the crane than it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but it said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the Great Moschee, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered together in front of the hijackers who were held later this month.
The Bin Laden Group did not issue statements about the collapse of cranes, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also sent the group to non-current security measures and failed to cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mekkas Großmoschee as part of the massive construction project run by the Bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990's.
The fall of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital.
Officials have ordered that 1 million (£174,000) to pay to the relatives of the displaced persons and to have the same amount of permanent injuries.
Other people are injured in half of that amount.
B & Q Boss says that the time of the cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over.
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury.
The number of qualified tradesmen from Eastern Europe has increased behind them.
The result is that 200 other screwfix-shops targeted at craftsmen will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q retail outlets nationwide.
By Rupert Steiner, City CEO correspondent of the Daily Mail.
It is claimed that Britons are putting down their pens and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Polish craftsmen who carry out work in their homes.
If you can handle a hammer or a brush to remove walls, you now seem to be a minority.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out home jobs in their homes, the head of the company is behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the construction markets, said that a large rise in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now outdated.
Thus, Kingfisher plans to open 200 other screwfix shops aimed at tradesmen and 60 retail outlets of B & Q.
Mrs. Laury said that she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop were taken by women.
At the moment, the men predominate in the hands of the employees.
She said that it is necessary to confront the growing demographic trends faced by more female single households who have made more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "It still works a majority of men in our stores.
We need to shift this more closely to a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are 80% of women with 80% of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of the leading companies listed by only five women at the head of a UK in the FTSE100 Index, has also reoried its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in positions of responsibility.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied just 50% of the team with women, including its Management Board and CFO.
Mrs Laury said: 'This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue.
It has not been difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in the period of semi-annual income and conversion, after the group owed the cost of closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich / Dob due to infidelity to the courts.
On Wednesday, at the regional court of Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice President, Aich / Dob have had to answer on Wednesday for being unfaithful and deductible.
They are not guilty of the accused.
One of them had also been accused of abuse.
He was acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to the Attorney General Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation crystallized that the accused used funds for private use in 2006 until 2011, until 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 Euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial crime.
This fact left the president of the office, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be discussed at a later date.
The reason for this was that the organization was not set up at any time.
The sports officials would only have set aside expenses for expenses and the sports club for which they had been involved from 1982 to 2011, to whom they had invested a lot of time and money out of the debt.
"At the time, we were faced with the situation: Carry on with the club, or shut it down," said one of the accused, who was in the hands of the bread profession of the auditor of finance.
With his colleagues and fellow Members, he decided to do so.
With all the risks.
"We have spent money there, our life insurance companies have come to safety at the bank," said he.
The organization was agreed: You can manage the money freely, you are not allowed to have any debt.
What is more, when it is necessary to achieve financial success, the disbursement of allowances has been decided retrospectively until 1991.
That is why some of the expenses were paid out years later, from 2003, when a plus was on the account.
That is why it seemed that the former Obman also seemed to be talking about things that had not been booked out to detail.
The accounts and savings books managed to manage the two defendants together, the second accused.
Why the payouts were not disclosed to the club, the judge asked.
The organization has not been interested in the detail for financial management, it was important just to have the freedom of debt, so the answer.
When a sum of EUR was transferred to the association account in 2011, a sum of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
These were reserves, the defendants said.
This securities account was run on the name of the second defendant and was not known by the association.
"Why?," the judge wanted to know.
For a long time, the interviews knew no answer.
Then he said that he believed that this was the best for the club.
If something had happened, no one would have known anything about this money.
The co-accused had been informed, it was right that he was able to do so.
This transfer has been formulated as the "Damage of damage."
Why the claim was made, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first explained that he had not agreed to this formulation because the organization had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says: "With you, you are all out of the Schneider."
"I am a legal representative," he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he never received a cent salary.
He had charged the club with the club on 1,000 euros per month, but the real effort was much higher and he added.
Accurate records for the early years failed to show the defendants.
They were no longer kept after an operation audit in which everything had been judged correctly, they said.
The second defendant was referred to by kilometers as well.
All of the homes are available in cash, and he said in his statement that he had to travel to the bank from his place of residence of the bank to the bank.
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the testimony of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard has set another 30,000 jobs.
In addition to the workforce reduction that has been going on for three years, the computer giant in the division of the company will cut further jobs.
There is no end to the job cuts with the American PC giant Hewlett-Packard (HP).
Within the framework of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce the volume of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division.
This would save EUR 2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion), which was reported by the company on Tuesday.
The step will result in a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The current reduction of 55,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed.
HP still employed a workforce of around 302,000 staff at the end of fiscal 2007/14.
After all, the Hewlett Packard shares recorded 2.3%.
At the moment, the California Palo Alto Corporation, which has grown with printers, is now turning out to be bundled in a new company this year, separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both businesses are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A more disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand by corporate clients for services enabled Lenovo to become the world's second-largest PC manufacturer.
In the third quarter, at the end of July, sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.4 billion dollars.
The revenues decreased to 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to changes in the industry with a split and massive job losses.
The 76 year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has late responded to the fact that customers are buying smartphones and tablets rather than on conventional computers, where more and more businesses are doing business online.
In total, Whitman's restructuring plans see the reduction of some 55,000 places.

Röszke: Violence of violence on the Serbian border
The Hungarian police have been using the Serbian border of Röszke Tränengas to several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent, Dániel Bozsik, has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind it, a police line had formed, and a watershed was prepared behind the police.
40 to 50 refugees started to throw stones, sticks, and plastic bottles to officials.
The officials initially used pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas has been sprayed towards the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn something of their own.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the area.
Children who inhaled the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees joined together and suffered from breathing.
The press spokesmen of the Serb police have also suffered injury by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
The time to decide on interest rates for the Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to take the important decision as to whether or not interest rates are raised for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half, which last week thought that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25%.
It is a historical event because it was seven years since the Fed set interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and launch a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Chief Executive Officer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global relations.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence indicates that the opportunities for such a step are good.
The decision to be announced at 8.00 p.m. CET on Thursday
Death guard at the Delta State University left writing letters of apologies.
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before being killed by his colleagues on the day of day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" at the first murder and he wanted "it could do it," the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi said that lamb, lecturer for Geography and Social Science Education at the Delta State University, to call the emergency number at 10: 00 on Monday morning.
And said that he had shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre that the police need to send police officers to their homes.
He said, "I swore my wife yesterday evening," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but that no one will disrupt it, but that it will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller by his name, but he did not give him.
Lamb did not explain for his shots.
As a police the scene entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten notice of Lamb, 45, who said: "I'm so sorry, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb rode 300 miles to the Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when he turned him in.
University President William LaForge said that he knows nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Of course there was something in Mr Lambs."
Despite reports on Monday, which the Lamb allegedly believed that it also had a relationship with Schmidt, officials on Tuesday said that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years as a "good man."
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and the prentiss would have a daughter who is 19, who was "destroyed on the ground."
He said that she was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online at home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had met lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police said that lamb had called relatives at a certain point of time on Monday to tell them that "he will not go to prison."
When policemen arrived at Hwy 1 close to Greenville later at that night, lamb drove his car to the side, fled to walk, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctorate from the Delta State University about how his life was listed on the university's website.
Stars who Lost Your Happiness
The actor (left), in the image with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against Leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor also claims to fight with drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa builds the Group.
Lufthansa plans a large group of companies.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization.
150 of the around 1,000 leaders around the world will cost a job.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and valuing the cheap coal industry.
The goal of the realignment was to generate a earnings contribution of around €500 million per year from cost and energy synergy.
Amongst other things, Lufthansa will henceforth no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The low-cost airline, Eurowings, should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt, the CEO of Carsten Spohr, will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
With the change, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
Thus far, the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of €30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective dispute with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations are to be resumed after the trial cancelled on Thursday this Thursday.
That was what the trade union told.
The topic of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
"In a year with a projected record result, "Cockpit wanted to achieve good results as soon as possible.
The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the pilot's transition, the pilot is the saving concept "Wings."
It says that in the struggle against competitors, Lufthansa is excluding the Group's own budget line from Eurowings.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months because of a twofold question.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this has brought the left hand to the wine and will be excluded from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not believe that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno at the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw had collapsed in the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg and is in the hospital."
It will be moved tomorrow, or perhaps a day later, and then operated in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it is very difficult and then fantastic, and then that happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, the six months last, and it will not be in the group phase.
I hope that he will be able to play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a Red card and the imposition of an Elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexicans.
Van Gaal assumed that the Italian judge had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elfeter and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack on both feet.
A tweet said: "I thank you all for your messages, words cannot describe how I am, my way to recovery now begins to return."
Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat of PSV.
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championships in France to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It is a very bad injury."
When a player leaves the place with this type of injury, all are very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to break an opponent.
Moreno suffered a near break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland during the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury that is not good," said Cocu.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction, so it looked as if he had touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In the interview with SBS6 said Moreno: "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad and I am sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a Foulgame by Chris Smalling.
Certainly, David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is a matter that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not be long before you know it almost by heart.
It is that you are perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite child book, the prime minister decided for The Lorax, who appeared in 1971 as the environmental label of Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a news on the website of the SuperCamp, and continues: "funny, moving, creative, with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give an image or a message that we have so far missed."
All this is all well and good, except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book, instead, reflected a summary of the film version of 2012 that added new characters and details in order to extend the fairly short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thmake-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by saying that he wants to see a real tree.
As if that were not suspicious enough, the text submitted by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the film presented by the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database, and begins: "in the walled city of Thneed Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of
Although he admits that he admits that he is a pragmatic father, Cameron is unlikely to be so familiar with the plot of the book.
Most probably, such a relatively low PR job was delegated to a helper who did not read a child 20 times before.
A Downing Street spokesperson said that the text was likely to have come from Cameron's electoral office.
SuperCamp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but did not make any other immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of the exclusion of England's team, but it is still difficult.
To run on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the cadres that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my card.
I would not rule out winning.
Alastair Cup side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting, and the Community spirit is strong; they will not bear scars of 2012, but they are a deeply positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin-off and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related messages: Adam Lyth leaves from the England test Kader and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to let Adam Lyth leave, of course, is difficult for me to see as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
With its seven tests, there were two good attacks on difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are targeted at results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - as I said earlier - players are their best selection.
A long time ago, Lyth would have been extended, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he is hopefully going to go further to Yorkshire, another one is possible.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not provide such good performance, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test drummer receives to set its character is difficult.
Lyth got seven odds - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and exit.
The only accusation that could be made was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - Lyth was at the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a drummer whom I love high.
He is an X-Factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early in the season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge spot, which struck us very much.
He has to have at least the same opportunities as those received before him, but this naturally depends on the team composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of beating Moeen alongside Cook, providing an extra Spin Bowler and getting four quicks appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a drummer cannot beat there, and it has already shown that he is a vicious circle of cricket players.
Moeen has perhaps failed to do his job for his County Worcestershire, but is number 3 for them, and there is no big difference.
My former team mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an Opentor in 2001.
He has three hundred Runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the kader as the back, and in my limited treatment with him he has impressed me as a young man.
People may see its statistics - average 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and thinking, it is a punt, but there are no large number of backup spiders who rise their hands, and the trainers have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some intelligent additions to the trainee.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman of Sri Lanka, as adviser to the test games could be a masterpiece.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, who will bring a wealth of experience as he played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player, or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights from which we can profit.
Sometimes new voices can take place in the changing room, even if the messages are in line with what was said earlier.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used by the One-Dayers, root received a similar break against Australia and I, for my part, have no problem with it.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and Teamsters do not determine the timetable.
And you need to think that, as with the players, their jobs are dependent on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.

My European friend, who wants to see Britain out of the EU, "Let us not stand alone with France," says Berlin - and it is possible to see that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached the point at which they do not care whether or not we are going to go.
Germany's cautious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years, and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them, as it did in the excessively long of Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14), and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks to his re-election, or its replacement in 2017.
It is also a force to be stopped.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left.
It is hard to imagine that they are going to break a leg to help the Selfie Britons, whose energy should be used better to stop Scotland's exit from the UK.
Thus, some of these ministers may even be planning deliberately unhelpful comments, in the SNP style, when Britain's referendum campaign, 2017, to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation was a default," and "Britain has nothing to gain from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense, and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press, as they were during the 1973 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
They are weak at Boris Johnson, the Erz Euro-opportunists, who made a name for himself as a "EU-strait banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.
In all its rigidity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
Among them was the Medley of Tax-fearing robes, foreigners who are using telephone, and the pseudo-non-residents who own most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similar to them, but found that when you are sitting with a hot gorilla in a cage, you are distributing better bananas to distract him, rather than for lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself, when he resisted Cameron's rhetoric, because Blair had opposed the principle of the unenacted constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened it up by a back door.
The press has never lost it.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who on Monday at Westminster gave me a kind of kindness on the back - I told him that he no longer need time to do for me - seems to be repeating Neil Kinnock boycott of Morsi's 1980s strategy, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns's official position on Europe is - I'm going to express it nicely - in the development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukips, traditional Blaufarbstin-tendencies and the wild fellows of Tory's Little English, may well say "yes" to each of them.
It is what Hilary, but no Bennite "Benn" radio and television, said this week when the Scout fought in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as the Shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70-ties when his old father on television tried to be illoyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilarty's struggle was more attractive.
However, in order to remain "under all circumstances," Benns's expression was not what McDonnell was saying, nor was what JC told his fellow Members after all the reports at their meeting on Monday night.
Whatever Corbyn's worn-out image, remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of television around the clock and, above all, in the Strudel of the Social Media, a breeding ground for paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign self-evident, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns, the basic ambiguity about membership of the EU - in line with their anti-capitalist past, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esotericism among leftist dissidents, for which the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic contentions.
As with its ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that JC will not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - in order to make concessions to the British, if all this can be meaningless?
The US is already rather disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even with a reduction of the Tory Government, which I remembered at the start of Monday, which I called the British influenza Security Forum.
Experts criticize Report of Public Health England on E-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "principled report" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
One editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month addressed the "extremely windy foundation" on which PHE established its main conclusion.
Two further researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand.
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
You said that the public expects that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that E-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed examination of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA), to lead their opinions on the damage caused by different nicotine products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose directors had previously been awarded by British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the TAOs on Public Health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said that it was going to receive funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not in addition to the funding it was supposed to have received from the tobacco company, Philip Morris International, by the tobacco company, which was added to it.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the body are not supplied, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also specify sector-specific funding on paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting, the tobacco management of PHE also participated.
The work done by the group "significantly" states that there is a shortage of "hard evidence for the damages of most products on most criteria," writes McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there has been no evidence that E-cigarette serves as a road to smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at PHE, said that BMJ's claims were already responded earlier.
He said: "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarette are low in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is proven and what is not, especially when there are so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National health system £2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking is that we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up Eastenders, says former boss of Channel 4.
The former leader of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as Eastenders and The Voice.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard-contested time windows, against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters, such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that for six years at Channel 4, without success, Channel 4 tried to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast that would clearly be shown by non-subsidised rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus-Communications Committee, as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea either in the medium term or in the long term, its production should at least be on programmes that others do not do or order.
They send The Voice in a premium time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax is financed by programs that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, Eastenders is another one, admittedly both of its own productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their rights.
I am trying to see how this is to be public service television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the quest for valuations "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC give again what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should be selling Eastenders.
Johnson said that the more public legal niches programs "should go to BBC4, where one quite cannot measure the audience, but they are fulfilling their tasks, and they can argue that when they go to their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They lay them in a window where nobody ever wanted to see them.
On the radio fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Of course all of them, we all think that you get a lot of money for 150 £per year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £, I wonder if that is true, because they do not consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky- and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also said before the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should review its Reithian mission "to inform, educate and entertain."
He said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it is 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should take an example to public service television stations in Australia and Canada to change "informing, educating and maintaining" these.
On the subject of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the proms, of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown, and the commercial channels to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves.
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes are changing the direction at the moment when they are being heard with sound pulses that are heard for the human hearing at high frequencies in order to be heard.
The impulses work by activating Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
More about this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light.
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process, called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Saltekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that the procedure one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation, a invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fat worms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, it found out, amplifying the ultrasound waves that then invade the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic shafts work on structures that are called TRP 4-ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the cubes.
The sound waves open up these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned.
In order to create Ultry-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Motoneurons are carrying TRP-4 ion channels.
When using ultrasound on the modified creatures, the sound waves of the Mikrobbers are amplified and transmitted to the worms where they are turned on the modified Motonions.
The procedure has some similarities to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with impulses of the light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light that has to be sent down to an optical fiber in the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic shafts can pass unhindered and can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Misleading Britain's Arms Trade
Watch Amnesty International, Amnesty International.
Terrible killer drones!
It is also possible to use foot joint!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock, which causes painful pain, but does not leave a trace!
The happy voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this display for the world's largest arms fair is a combative parody that was produced by Amnesty International in order to put the spotlight on the British Government's willingness to conceal weapons to repressive regimes on Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.
Related: DSEi weapons trade fair: Authoritarian regimes flood to London.
But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are at bus stops and the subway trains and require a second look.
"important notice: Travel from the 15th to 18th of September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) read in the font types of the London Underground and the hallmarks of the DLR line, which is transformed into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers are going to drive with the DLR... customers are invited to help to stop the weapons fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have issued their work in the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective with the name Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a 6£ -Pack of Inbuskeys, who claim that "access to about a third of the bus traffic advertising surfaces on the planet."
Transport for London finds this poster not funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol designs and lectors at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to make political works outside of galleries.
Many artists take turns with activists in protest movements and notice that they have to go out into the real world outside, so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters is the commuters on the metro.
The Amnesty International has been viewed over 24 hours on Facebook for more than 100,000 times and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, who works with the graphic and voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising of the weapons fair - by building the ExCeL calendar - and thinking: "Give them the campaign they try to avoid."
They played with the advent of a more realistic corporate advertising, but "thanks to the introduction of bright colors and animation keeps it stronger."
"You have made a fantastic job by helping us to sharpen awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we now need is intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be illegally traded outside our door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are selling fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab exposes an order of the US army to "the AT4CS RS" fired from the shoulder."
Among them is a "uniquely shaped combat head, which delivers outstanding after-effects within the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, when I moved to a student residence as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, still in faith in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smile of those who annoyed me - and the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The arrival in student residences ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to laugh: People tell where you come from, whether and where you have taken Sabbatyear where you are talking about Corbyn, and where you are talking about Corbyn, and why you do not love to love it.
Breathe.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak, even if your eyelashes were in fire and these fire extinguishers.
Let people be allowed to do so.
The rooms of humans are often transformed into drinks recipes, film night events, and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people are attracting and wearing their underwear.
In this case, do not think of starting at the university with a relationship.
Introverted get a rough treatment at the university.
Their rooms should be a refuge, but many of the student residences are a space for bony culture, which is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say: "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a commun of conviviality is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of a message.
To beat Apropos: Do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship are filling through baking.
Since you are starting the university at the peak of the back mania, the clapping is on the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brownies, less strange than welcoming the 1950" s "welcome to the neighbourhood, I've prepared something for you.
Homemade treats are a good way to make friends.
They feel obliged to speak and will eventually associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed clumps out of flour, sugar and fat to cause people to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, the claws of chicken is a theft, but is it the assumption of a drop of millet for your tea also?
Check that with the owner.
The chances are good that they are saying that they are using themselves, even if they are cooking internally.
When someone steals your belongings, that is annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to treat them more evenly than my fellow, who added their milk to punish thieves.
It is now in prison.
They should not make a noise that prevents people from being from sleep or from work.
It is not just a question of being a decent person, but you literally belong to the people who are sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbors whether it is something that makes them quieter, because it had three in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
She responded with even better music.
When they finally heard them at 5 a.m., they kindly allowed their neighbors to sleep two hours before they broke their own music, closed their door and went to their three-hour examination.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse were to join the same student residence by accident?
Conversely, it would not be unreasonable if you were to hold a fellow Member for your future spouse, go to them, get rid of them, see them again every day, and perhaps witness how they draw all common friends to themselves?
Of course, the heart goes through its own paths - but if a hot female definitely is not your future spouse, at least you try to persuade your subordinator some reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between an ulcer and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good trick is funny, but it only takes moments until he becomes a boomerang.
Give you a valuable and amusing lesson about security, but don't be afraid of a room with toothpaste and shampoo, you won't be able to do so.
Close your door, and insert your keys into a glass of water, which you will put into the freezer.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low salaries
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the Central Franconian corner of terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money.
Thus, for example, for refugees, but also as a signal: "It is not just refugees who need to live, but also the single mother and the low earners."
"I show how you can build even better today," says the 43-year-old in the interview.
Thousands of refugees are being pushed into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes that housing can be created quickly: It builds in a project for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees are being pushed into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass of accommodation in containers or gymnasiums has no sustainability.
After all, the people will remain here to a large extent.
In the face of the flow of refugees, we will also need enough housing over the next few decades.
A completely banal 3-story row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
It makes integration easier.
This is different when people are taught in blocks.
Each of the six houses built on the pilot project consists of three housing units for each of the four asylum seekers.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, kitchen and a common room.
It may be that many refugees are going to say, it is peace, I am going backwards.
Then the houses can be easily adapted to their respective needs.
How much is the cost?
Gildner: The price of 160 square metres per house is 184 000 euro, without land.
That is easy to understand.
The construction took six months.
That is appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I decided to run my project correctly.
What makes it particularly complicated is the threat of Damocles and the place of residence.
Gruselig.
It is still assumed that whoever creates three homes in a terraced house needs at least three car places.
It is only in cities that lack the place to do so.
And refugees and asylum-seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury constructions for asylum seekers.
This is definitely not true.
Do you not increase competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: The truth is: We have had a building boom in Germany over the last five years, but have been built, luxury housing, which can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
It is not only refugees, but also the single mothers or the low earners alike.
I show how you can build today even better.
That is what this is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems in Regensburg and first dealt with environmental analyses.
Ios 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, typing on "General" and selecting "Software Update."
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation because they get an error message that says that the "software update has failed."
In order to avoid the problem, users are advised to wait until the onslaught goes down or try to update on iTunes.
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process.
This may be the reason for creating the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it less likely due to the tightening of the update, and it will also be easier to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall apps when the process is completed.
It is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or that it is close to a charger so that the battery is loaded.
When the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may close halfway and could lead to a break of the update.

Rosberg's only motto: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the battle for the World Cup title in the Formula 1 against its clearly leading Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton.
The World Cup stressed before starting in the crucial seven overseas races, "that I have nothing more to lose."
There are 53 points that separate the Viceroy in Singapore on this Sunday by defending champion and winning champion Hamilton.
The British already won seven of the twelve races of the season, and also attacked the floodlit Grand Prix in the city state.
2009 and last year, the 30 year-old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an influence on Singapore's Great Prize is still unclear.
For days, a mist hangs over the city, triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member.
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen," which was founded three months ago, has included another member of its ranks, thus raising the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who has spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Federal Meritorious Cross and honorary citizens of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that took place at the head of Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to record chess players who are unable to raise the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search are also to be pursued.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the Chess Club and also friendly contact with the Tennis Club "Rot-Weiß" will be seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town.
Accommodation office is looking for direct contact.
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined forces under the mantle of the Social Foundation and have opened a new contact area at Graf Stauffenberg Square.
It is also possible to take part in courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city centre.
More than that, it needs to be placed at the Graf Stauffenberg Square.
A new service office was opened there recently.
Here, right next to the purchasing market, they immediately receive senior citizens and information about questions, such as care insurance, or services of the health and nursing staff.
For years, we have established with our outpatient care services that people who often care for them are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"It is also impossible to take advantage of many of the funds that have not yet been recognized, because the complexity of the insurance is hardly yet understood," explained the new owner, Jutta Weigand, who is responsible for the Department of Deputies, the Antonistit and the Civil Service, as well as the ambulance service "Amadeus."
In addition to the consultations, the new service office also offers prevention, health classes and wellness.
To this end, the Saludis was taken to the boat.
It is therefore possible to use additional offers such as falling prevention, memory training, or physical therapy.
The offers of the senior center and the Saludis complement each other ideally.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The senior center for care and care," depicts Heike Riedel, managing director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new service office in the city centre is that both business leaders are particularly concerned with demographic change.
This makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg vital in the future.
"There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite you to a regular social get-together."
Thus the social foundation makes a great contribution that seniors can live as independently as possible in their familiar surroundings.
The accommodation office is opened Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 2 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 and on Saturday from 10 am to 12.
Eintracht Bamberg versus Würzburger Kickers on October 6.
Now it is official: After having been set at the Fuchsparkstadion at the Fuchsparkstadion of the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg had not yet been determined by the third of Würzburger Kickers, now the 6th of October was set as the deadline.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg at the end of the Bavarian football Totopokals was finally terminated now.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6th, at 19: 00 in the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going on the stage, now we have planning security," FCE Team Manager Karlheinz Hümmer also points out to the pre-sale now started.
It is special for our team to play against a third party.
We hope for a lot of spectators, and that is not without reason, because flood lights have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg moved by victory to the district leaders 1st FC Oberhaid (3: 1) and 1 FC Schweinfurt 05 (3: 2).
The winner of the contest will receive 5000 Euros and will qualify for the first round of the DFB.
It is also possible to control the front cover.
The architect, Karl Mang, passed away from the age of 92.
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of the Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died already on 5 September at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and, at the same time, "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna."
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but has also worked as a teacher, writer, and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983, he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design.
In the 1980s, he was assigned to the Austrian Theatre Museum with the establishment of the treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws politics with money.
Former footballer Tim Wiese was noticed in Bremen.
Footballer was once, meanwhile Tim Wiese, ex-national hero in Germany, was involved in Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler was involved.
He wants to have 30 kg of muscle mass according to his own statement over the past two years.
In contrast, he has not allowed himself to be intellectually intellectual.
It was possible to cut the hair in the inner city of Bremen, when he saw how out a car park guard provided a criminal note for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Meadow storbled out of the shop, insulted the official and threw her the due fine before the feet, as reported in the "picture" newspaper.
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The thing is still in the examination," says the city of Bremen.
First of all it will be determined whether field is displayed or not.

Men Bold on 17 Years Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soder Salmünster: On Friday night, at 11.45 p.m, three young men were at the foot of Bad Soden towards the Salmünster.
One from the group, aged 17, was followed by the police by the police at a distance of about five metres and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft petrol station.
There were also three people on the gas station.
One of these men now shouted the young and turned them into the face.
The victim suffered a fracture of the nose and was fed up by his nose.
When his two friends rushed and appeased the racquet, he first left him off his victim.
From his friends, the injured young man has now been taken home.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a passenger car to their home and left them on several occasions.
When you no longer saw the vehicle, the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the racquet and another male person.
The face and the thighs of the victim were tested by the help of a stroke.
The injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
Up to now, there has only been a vague description of the facts.
One of the men was about 1.80 metres tall.
The second racquet was supposed to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and signers to report themselves at 06185/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over field tours and invests 310,000 euros.
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felöhausen.
We are also pleased to hear about Bernd Bormann, economic support in Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places on the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf is lucky: That is where Dr. Frank Müller takes up the practice.
While Ursel retires to retirement, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, is still at half over the next few months over the next few months.
After a period of reconstruction, Müller opened the practice on October 12th, until then he invested 310,000 Euros in the premises at the St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was a favourite of Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who were currently getting to contact with Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll and want to enter into practice at the moment.
"We had always in mind that the garbage would be well suited to this practice," said Dr. Ursel.
"When that was the case, I just called them."
Müller liked the idea of having its own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"Our proximity and permanent contact with patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany families over the years."
He also feels that he is soon to be his own boss.
And thus one was agreed that the garbage bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in quarry Vilsen.
There, the two-fold father, Frank Müller also grew up, of his Medizinstudium in Hanover, followed by stations in several doctors, as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nuriburg and Rotenburg.
At the moment he is employed as a chief surgeon in Sulingen and was appointed in 2009 as a chief physician in the County of Diepholz.
As of September 19, practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felöhausen works as a family doctor, his wife, Ursel, has specialized in gastroenterology.
The garbage lers, both internists, want to establish themselves as a family doctor.
"Endoscopy comes out," says the 38 year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After being converted, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound tests and long-term and endurance EKGS and need a chat room more.
In addition, the computer is completely overhauled.
A total of EUR 50000 will be given to the waste by the municipality (EUR 25000) and the Sami Community (EUR 12500) and the municipality (EUR 12500).
"This shows how proud and glad we are that practice continues," said Bernd Bormann.
For example, according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients arrive in the field in the field, and the North German average practice is about 500.
In Asendorf there is also a further in-house practice practice.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller's practice: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf according to Ursel.
If no successor had found its way, it would have gone.
Anyone who visits Müller's point of office will also be able to take a look in familiar faces, especially in familiar faces.
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, and it has been practised there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felöhausen.
She has felt a little bit of sadness after the long time.
"We still live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often," says the internist.
Her husband added: "We have a 6000 square metre plot."
"So far I have always pressed before garden work, now that could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and is happy to travel.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees by"
"Now border controls are also driven at our southern limit," said interior minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
Controls at the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an application can do so.
The supply and security of the people is the main priority.
"It is also clear that it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
The people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migratory flows, including the Austro-Hungarian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering "Corridor" - Slovenia
The Croatian Government had previously announced that Slovenia, too, wanted to leave refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also create corridors for the refugees.
However, the interior minister, Vesna Györkös Znidar, did not see it in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Slovenia is going to intensify surveillance of the border, especially in Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenians are going to want to shut down its borders for refugees.
"Every Member State must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
As announced by the Croatian Government, the first refugees had already tried to enter the night of Tuesday at Ost-kroatien at the Tovarnik / Sid border to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to follow them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to the local media, police vehicles with new refugees have constantly been held in Croatian Tovarnik.
These are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use.
In the coming days, his country with about 4,000 refugees will be counting, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian Serb border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to the direction of Croatia, reported by Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was, the people are saying that there are certain routes to take: "neither we nor we want to do so," it was said.
According to the media reports, at least in the morning, a first bus of about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid, that more buses would be expected during the course of the day.
Concerning Croatia, Slovenia and Austria after Germany
The inmates were on the road the entire night of the Macedonian border of Macedonia, which was about 500 kilometres from Macedonia.
"We have heard that Hungary has admitted that the police said that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
Thus, it may well be possible for observers to postpone the previous Balkan route, which has already been postponed, that has already been postponed to Turkey, Turkey, Macedonia, and Serbia to a slightly further west line.
Croatia: "Comprehensive opportunities for border control"
Croatia's interior minister, Ostojic, had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not refer to the details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had comprehensive options for border control.
Strict checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, which has been a good example to the country since then on the basis of the standard of border control.
On the Serbian side, there are still some 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they had spent the last night at the crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, both Horgos and Backi Breg continue to be closed completely.
Whether the remaining refugees want to move to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Home Secretary, Nebojsa Stefanovic, tried to reassure him on Wednesday morning with a local eye in Horgos: He considered the debates on alternative routes of refugees to be premature after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment.
One cannot say whether they would continue their trip to Hungary, Croatia, or another country.
Aid rates to migrants - dangerous, alternative routes.
However, private Hungarian refugees have already started distributing the refugees maps on which there are alternative routes through Croatia.
However, border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: In parts of the border area, there are still areas of mines that have not yet been cleared by the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine-spacers was sent to the border region.
Stock Hacker: Ukrainians are paying $30 million
Supranonok is supposed to have been part of a ring of cybercrime, who has been accused of gaining insight into still unpublished financial reports and press releases since 2010 on sites such as BusinessWire, Marketwired and PR Newswire.
With the information collected, insider trading will have been made in the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of over $100 million was seized.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught," says the SEC communication.
The trials against 32 other suspects were accused in the case.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are supposed to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ökumenische Hospizhilfe Mannheim has been in service for 20 years.
There is a lot of activity to do in Mannheim.
The people do their worries, sometimes fast steps, partly feel comfortable.
You control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalons at Paradeplatz.
Keep track of the city.
Pulsating, life with beautiful autumn sunrise, and moving in the middle of four large panels with the headline "Bevor I would be nostalgic...."."
The Ökumenische Hospizhilfe drew attention to its 20-year anniversary with this action and is well faced with mixed reactions.
"It is about life, therefore we have gone to the action in the middle of the city and people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical hospitalization is also at the disposal of the passers-by, as well as to questions and conversations, as well as to the volunteers.
While some people spontaneously stand up to the chalk and add "my life in affirmative," "to drive the camper through the United States," "stop the war," "to stop the war," while others are short of standing, others are short, read sentences as "as far as I am not yet" and go on.
Again and again, small discussions about the action in itself, about life, dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on the spot as well.
"When I realise that at some point the end of the world will come to me, I can live responsibly," says the director of the diaconic work of Mannheim, who, together with the Caritasverband, is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
That is why this public action on the 20-year olds is good.
The fact that not everyone on the panels wanted to share it publicly is, however, understandable, which is, after all, a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death remains with taboos, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although it is precisely the hospice movement that has played a great deal of work in recent years, that is that people are opening up.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The recipient of the pregnancy and trauma is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Through personal experience, they read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.
When Ökumenische Hospizhilfe was looking for honorary officials, they reported immediately and were involved in the foundation of 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected people and members in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her role and the experiences and experiences that have been made.
"I see life from another, it is precious and precious the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical service is free and non-denominational.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations by families and associations allows for the training, training and supervisions of the dying and wedding attendants.
Trainings for new employees are offered every two years.
The panels described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be listed on postcards as well.
Mixed with FedEx results, financial prospects for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant has lowered its earnings outlook to a year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its naval service.
The company also said that it plans to take about 55.000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would want to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The share fell about 2.5% in Premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening of Wednesday.
FedEx Corp said that a profit between US $10,40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that will end in May, is 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected, according to a survey of FactSet 10,84.
The lower views, despite price increases, which are an average of 4.9%, on 4 January, are going to take effect on 4 January and, despite the increased increases in the price of ground transportation, from heavy and large packages that are going to be made from November onwards.
The company said that it nevertheless expects that the result compared to the previous year will rise due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that "solid returns are provided by the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, who plans to end the same number of people, the same number of times as last year, to 90,000 to 95,000.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million a year, 6% more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, almost $2.44 per share, the analysts surveyed twelve of Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has recorded a decline in international priority shipping, which brought sales in its unit express shipping to Stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales of ground transportation increased by 29%, but the operating result was largely flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In Premarket Trading, about one hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell by 3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed a 11% loss for the year and 17% at a record high on 11 June.
At its most awaited meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise the policy rate for the first time in almost a decade.
The United States faces a wall image of the United States at the end of an end of the two-story assembly.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues want to set the economic interests of the nation before all else.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximisation of US employment and prices here.
But, since the Great Recession, the Fed has recognized leaders that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate may be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it.
Although most of the economy shows that it is growing well, the recent turbulence on the global financial markets may make the already prudent Fed officials anxious to amplify this volatility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds, even if it were just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It seems that the labor market and inflation will be the main thing that they are watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economics at the Maklermaker Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Kg.
"But I think that if they were in search of a pretext of not raising the interest rate, the heightened uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait, said them.
There is no consensus on what the Fed is going to do, which worries itself to the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to withdraw, with a key indicator, which only has a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists try to mitigate the blow by promising that further increases are far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average was at 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599.85.
Action was triggered by expectations that the Fed Policy maintained the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to lift the sentences at that time," he said.
If it does, "it should go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that an interest-rate hike would reassure the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed likely to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions, which would test the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen in the spring and early summer said that this year, despite the liberals' complaints, that more economic progress would be necessary, it would expect an increase in the sentence.
Even though the creation of jobs slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years, and proximity to the level that the Fed views as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And, while inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherd, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets joined the entire world at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May below its peak when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now being almost 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy were not affected in the last few weeks, they would be pulling the reins in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow of the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve.
Now it says that it will wait at least one month to get its effects better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not the focus of the Fed, so it should not be involved technically in its decision-making.
But, at the end of the day, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
As far as 2013 is concerned, the mere indication of the Fed in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed can expect it not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to advise other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of Envestnet Inc..
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve of Richmond, VA, remarked this month that "the Fed has a history of overreaction on the financial market movements that apparently are not linked to economic fundamentals."
Paint, voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is committed to an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to cut its policy rate by 0.75 percentage points into three sessions "despite the limited noticeable effect on US growth."
A year later, Fed representatives have reversed these cuts.
The Fed should take part in aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Poznań, a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England.
The recent turbulence does not come near this level, he said.
"It certainly doesn't want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of an interest-rate hike because markets're excited," said Poznań, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and I do not believe that it should be preceded by the time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Indeed, Chinatown
The market was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Lax-C is often referred to as Thai costal and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, he is in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market / the camp is a central point of call and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewellery and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department when you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes about an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If all shopping is hungry, there is a meal in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is close to the cash desks and has various participation options.
What is happening here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
Lax-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the bar will purify the fish and even fry it for you.
A good part of the store is the massive freezing section, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, all ducks, fish, blood of the blood and all of Galle, Gun natural darts, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Whoever buys here is: Restaurant owners and cooks, including individual families and individuals.
The wide gears are suitable for forklift trucks and forklift trucks.
You will find here: Fresh Monthong Durian next to the box office.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and the city centre - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: Lax-C has its own car park, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even though the shop is well attended, it is not difficult to find a car park.
Hoyerswerda: Small aid to refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
You will be greeted with a warm welcome without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support altruistic asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
They are still happy to teach them, even with their 74 Lesses.
Every Thursday it does it in the asylum seeker at the Dillinger Straße.
There, it helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo, and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is a very different lesson than at a real school.
Brazil's paediatric society promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding.
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS tries to inform women how important good nutrition is during breastfeeding, doing so with the presentation of images of babies who suck the breasts painted by depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a large number of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that a higher caloric intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake.
A recent study, headed by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that healthy nutrition actually affects pregnant women and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can have a negative effect on the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrian Sporthalle.
The municipal councillor of Bernried approved the contract for the EUR 2.3 million for the sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flat for the solar plant.
The plans for the long awaited turnaround building at the Bernrian sports grounds are taking a step forward: At the most recent council meeting, the work worked out without much discussion was unanimously approved.
Prior to that, the body had also decided on a request for a "exemption" from the valid building plan.
The "exception" was the permission for a special form of roof construction.
Thus, a "semi-roof" should be set up.
The planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar panels: "This brings us a wonderfully large southern roof," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was once again about the propensity to be below ten degrees for energy reasons - in contrast to the building plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "liberation" was thus required because the construction plan on the propensity of the roof does not allow for an "exception" - where the Bernrian councillor as a rule tends to be more restrictive about liberalizing applications.
However, this is not a recurring project: "We are not setting a precedent," the Steigenberger says.
The gymnastic building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
About 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense of costs.
Funding for grants is expected to be provided by the promotion of education and training.
In the next step, the construction request will be presented to the Landratet for examination for the 18 x 36 m wide hall.
The clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau.
The hospital Peißenberg is supposed to be closed sooner than planned - in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will be a member of a new medical director at the Hospital Schongau.
The station and the majority of the staff are moving from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is reflected in the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the County, which has been confirmed by the landlord Andrea Jochner Weiß.
A decision on this, however, will be taken by the Supervisory Board, and the meeting will take place on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 staff at the hospital in Peißenberg would be employed further.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the wider Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who are not able to go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim.
Employees are informed about the plans.
The change was caused by the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a doctor at the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice near the hospital.
When asked who to succeed, according to Joich-Weiß, the name "Fischer," he agreed to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, in any case, this means a "appreciation" and a broadening of the offer in the area of "Inner Medicine," that is Jochner white.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized on the interior station for gastroenterological diseases.
For the next two years, fishermen with its team, if the Supervisory Board agrees to the agreement of both houses, will lead the former hospital, which still has 35 beds, to be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years after a period of almost 140 years.
Thus far, the county had planned for 2018 when the current rehabilitation was completed at the hospital Weilheim.
Landlord Jochner White, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, has met rumors that the home, which is in the hands of the Federal Reserve, will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future.
"This is what I exclude from," and as the property continues, it has not been possible to say that there are several considerations.
At the moment there are a short time care of Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again," says Fischer, on the Quasi-move to the Lech, who was received by the staff "positive and very sympathetic."
There has been no real prospect for the house in which fishermen have been working as a chief surgeon for more than 30 years.
He was asked to take over the post of the medical director.
The hospital Peißenberg (once 100 beds) has been constantly threatened by closure over the past decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and maternity leave.
The handball players of the Rhein-Neckar lions are required this evening (20.15 p.m.) at the Bergischen HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be arrogant.
In the last season, the Badenes took a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to do with it.
Hunting case with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their corn harvest by shots on Tuesday afternoon.
While defaulting on a corn field at Pratau (district Wittenberg), several hunters were involved, as the police indicated.
After a shooting, a six- and 22 year man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals.
It was initially unclear how accurate it was to arrive at the accident.
The criminal police have been identified.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland Palatinate, victim of violent crime
A criminal offence has led the police to the body of the 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate, which had been missing from Saturday.
In the interrogation were the 20-year old, who killed young people and cast their corpses in a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing since Saturday, has fallen victim to violent crime.
The young woman was found on Tuesday night in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as were the prosecutors and police on Wednesday.
It is also true that a 20-year-old who was arrested on Tuesday night, according to the fact that it was stated, the investigators admitted and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-olds were missing on Sunday morning after they had not come home on the eve of a visit to a autumn festival in Rockenhausen as agreed.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal items of the victim.
Finally, in the case of interviews with the friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was finally a case of suspicion against the 20-year olds.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the corpse was found.
According to the authorities, according to the authorities, the authorities had killed the 16-year-old and placed the corpse in the channel.
The 20-year old should be presented to the court judge on Wednesday, the investigators put a dead letter to him.
The specific circumstances of the actions are intended to shed light on further investigations.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
There are also more and more refugees who are looking for an affordable leaded.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing faces a challenge.
The distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the incoming refugees and job-seekers from the EU, more and more people are pressing for a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with weak citizens around the last affordable housing.
In order to cover demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
The result is a study on behalf of the association "Social Housing."
By comparison: This year, 26,000 units in Germany will be completed.
There are thus a shortage of 140.000 flats.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first accommodation accommodation.
Many of them then go out to the housing market and join the long queues in front of the rentals.
According to the Statistical Office, however, last year fewer than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent.
The negative development of the housing market, however, is not only about the rising numbers of refugees.
The study also makes considerable shortcomings in the housing policy of the last few years.
Germany is shooting down a gap that grows from year to year.
At the moment, the number of units has already been missing in the agglomerations, Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals thus stayed in large cities in large cities of Austria.
Young adults were unvoluntarily staying at "Hotel Mama" because of the slack on the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square metres per capita has fallen again for the first time.
In order to solve the problem, the "Social Housing" Alliance is proposing a restart.
New incentives are intended to boost social housing.
The basic tax on subsidised housing could thus be suspended.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax write-offs are needed.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the state bank KfW is already well established with cities and communities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the EUR 300 million available was retrieved on Monday night at EUR 184 million.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free circulation: A corridor between Croatia and Slovenia.
After Hungary, there is practically no end, as ever more refugees choose the path to Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it has no obstacles to the transit via Slovenia to the north.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia intends to agree on the establishment of a corridor for refugees with the neighbouring country of Slovenia.
"I talked to the Slovenian interior minister, and when it is necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian interior minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the isolation of the Serbian border, hundreds of refugees have fled to Croatia in order to reach Western Europe from there.
500 people have come across the border with Tovarnik, the Croatian television news RTL reports.
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the previous day.
New legislation that came into force on the same day also makes proper asylum procedures in Hungary almost superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: 'You can travel and we are preparing to do so."
These people are there, women, children and men who want to live and who want to achieve something.
However, these are people who do not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the neighbouring country of Croatia.
Most came from media reports from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border city of Sid both by bus and by taxi.
Immediately after arriving, they would have been trying to get to Croatia on foot.
On the Croatian-Serb border, the refugees do not have border fences.
There are other dangers to this: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 1990s.
Mine-spacers are now supposed to create a secure passage.
After Hungary, however, after the closure of the border, there are few refugees.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 visitors.
Shortly before Monday on Monday, it was still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws introduce the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime.
Thus, in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 trials were started.
The convicts are in danger of prison sentences up to the age of five and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications, almost all of them - 93 - have been received on Tuesday in the newly established "Transeonen" set up at the border, of which almost all of the most important changes have been made to Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have been there as well.
In practice, however, no one has any chance of receiving asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian opinion, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered together.
In Röszke, workers are beginning to clean up.
They collected the garbage, which had left tens of thousands of people on the road over the past few weeks.
Gridgels were dismantled and one of the camps in the border town was converted.
No one wanted to express an opinion on the objective of this restructuring.
After the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria can only reach a few refugees.
The country also strengthened its border controls.
The population of 20,000 migrants was still in the country according to government data.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for further travel to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
Smaller groups of refugees regularly met in Freilassing.
The Mayor drove "Gestengete" across the border
"We were working on Sunday on Sunday when ten people were suddenly at the entrance of the tent at the entrance of the tent," says Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because Germany had surprisingly stopped railway traffic with Austria on Sunday, it had ended in Wernstein. "Stadler, who immediately offered his help, together with two other helpers and their cars, together with two other helpers and their cars had to drive across the border to the near Passau.
Prior to that, we've got rid of the unexpected guests only once, with snack and snack.
We said immediately, we brought them to Passau by car.
"That was of course for us," Stadler said in the OÖN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man did not take it to hand over a generous donation.
"It has been a pleasure for us," says Stadler.
On Sunday night, on the day of Sunday in Wels, the stranded train passengers were moving from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau, in order to try on the border after the short statement that rail traffic was stopped after Germany.
The regional train was parked just outside the border in Wernstein.
In Wernstein, the crossing of the border is generally high in the course.
The bridge with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday sociable, the day before a two-bridge course, is organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán is now sending further tens of thousands of us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping to build structures in stock, instead of helping to build structures that ensure humanity, our German Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian Government to the Dark Circle of National Socialism.
It is not only those Austrians who suffer from this policy, not just those Austrians who are now faced with chaos in the border areas.
They also have to discover that the "promised land" that they have been invited and welcomed is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, in the face of the ongoing migratory flows and approaching winter, to create humane conditions for those who are looking for protection.
And it will be an even greater one - the peace, security and stability of Austria.
Konrad in search of 35.000 wintry quartz
Konrad has all the hands to do with the transfer of refugees.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to draw up their service for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at Traiskirchen is already in the hands of Konrad.
"We have no homeless more in Traiskirchen," he reported of his first success.
Also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday, was done without a fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterpiece."
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, was talking about a "crisis situation."
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quartz in the year.
In order to fulfil the number, 35.000 accommodation will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are allocated to the countries, 15,000 of the federal.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it is not a bottomless pit," said Konrad.
He has already held talks with the regional leaders.
They would have promised him that he would continue to create a service for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's good," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, which is intended to clarify how the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action "Helping like we."
On the platform, private individuals can offer accommodation easily.
In addition, one hopes at hotels that are empty in winter.
Yesterday, Konrad and Maier criticized standards for accommodation as "very high."
In periods of emergency, it may not be necessary for service providers to have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holder or the size of the upper.
'emergency standards' should apply to a time-limited time.
That he is more successful in the case of accommodation, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, is the reason for his experience.
I am an older gentleman, who is not said to have the truth on the face.
The power of persuasion was its main weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any cost, as they themselves have said.
They want to raise them to three to four.
My own house has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to create a container on St. Stephen's Square as an office.
But there are clearly problems with the authorisation.
Linz calls for a Better Divide
At present, the city of Linz is not planning to open urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and the design centre for the accommodation of refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as those affected can be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In case of an emergency, however, further sites are to be tested for their suitability.
The chief minister criticises the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to contribute to this.
Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed.
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) has been involved in the further course of the refugee issue on Monday.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be closed down.
The continued journey of refugees to the Federal Republic remains possible.
However, it is precisely the appropriate border controls that exist.
Special trains with refugees to Germany are not going to exist at the moment.
However, the people in need of protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
The other member countries of the EU once again called for greater solidarity on the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is now introducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence of the action of the Germans."
The Next Runed is a question of time.
The general restoration of the "Neue Werft" in the industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production facilities, the publicly listed IT Group S & T has been recruited, the rest (2700 square meter) is to be leased to young innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In the IT the intelligent minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S & T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the New Shipyard and could later acquire which ones.
Right from the start, S & T intends to cooperate with the new neighbours.
S & T has invested EUR 1.7 million in the location, EUR 3.3 million from the TechCenter, which belongs to a third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria, and the federal (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S & T and TechCenter.
30 percent of the 2700 m2 surface in the building are already leased, for another 40 percent there are requests for requests.
LIA-Peroni owner opened a second store in the arcade.
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to purchase a dog.
This project had to push the 49-year-old holder of Lia Peroni on the Taubenmarkt Arkade: Finally, it now has an increase in another business local.
In the Furla shop, opposite the shop in which they sold, among other things, bags, bags, shoes and clothes of different manufacturers, all of them now revolve around women's handbags of the brand Furla.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were converted.
"I have long considered whether I am going to open a shop," says Breit.
One of the reasons for the decision was that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were struck by the idea of a separate location where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the Greater Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who themselves has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been made by her mother in the cradle.
I am most at fault when something is developing and I can show new trends at reasonable prices.
When so many women take care of a nice handbag, they are also unable to answer any last security.
Maybe it's that a nice pocket will appreciate every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump's ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are named Anencoders.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he is xenophobic, concerns journalists, or reveals the gaps in international crisis policies, the candidate for the US presidency is pushing the campaign firmly.
And it is a good thing to do.
This is also recorded in the Flemish Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the millions of real estate come from.
The New Yorker with the poster is a term for many in the Winzerdorf on the Wine Route.
Some parts of the 1200 inhabitants are related to them.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in electoral mode.
The Kallstädelle Simone Wendel turned a film over Trump.
And what do the villagers think about their goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think that these are somehow exciting, but they are not so impressed in their Kallstadter," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädner has filmed an amusing documentary about the town and its famous jumps, to which Trump also counts with Trump.
Trump, who is not known for humility, comes to the word "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would certainly succeed if he were to live in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the king of the heart.
While there is respect for the family's performance, it also tends to suggest that Trump "is already a bit of a great power."
Coincidentally, the nickname, the Kallstadt in the area, "Brulljesmacher," says: The dealer, he says.
Trump comes from the village of the Angians.
Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and the US opened a venue for gold graves.
The foundation stone of the real estate company was the first plot of plot in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: Their desire to return to the homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He did not record Trump because he was once without permission, the director of the Institute of Folk History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared himself at launch.
Trump is the grandson of a "illegal emigration."
This contrasts with the descendants of the descendants of their descendants.
He had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigration in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"This is not so nice," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative ("The Oma was a born Trump, the opa was born Heinz,").
In retirement, the wine growers tend to distance the Americans "that they are always so hot."
Does he believe that Trump is coming?
"I cannot imagine that," says the 72 year old.
"He has never looked at Kallstadt."
The owner of the Veronika Schramm, like some Kallstadter, mentioned that a visit was made by the Heinz family during a visit to the church organ, which generally came well.
"I cannot imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if he did not choose the vote, because "It has such radical views, I do not know if that is good."
If those who had the say at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.
And the President of the Commission?
"My president is not," she says.
And: "the grapes are also ripe without President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12 000 cinematographers, even in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian village of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain auction village."
Out of the hand of the vice-president of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfenng, the 1800-inhabitants village of the National Park of Berchtesgaden received the recognition for soft tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria, there are already 20 villages where you can find the "Bergauer Villages."
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain auction village" should have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the evaluations, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are running to Canberra to report the loss of the Liberal leadership, but there have been no major shifts in the reviews of Today.
The breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the Federal Capital, when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, the moderators of David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls, and Cancun.
This disadvantage for Australian TV viewers seemed not to have a role to play to Australian TV viewers, as sunrise reached an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared with the current 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase in comparison with the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283.000), but its number remained behind that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today, the gap has closed to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, the world reached an average of 318,000 compared with the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year the distance was between 40,000 and 50.000.
On average, Sunrise is 314,000 at Today in September.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are in order, thank you for the review!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015.
The main news was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently interrogated father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, has reached a very impressive figure of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered whether Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The outcome of last night answered this with a clear "yes."
The Enterprise was assigned to the USS Enterprise during the mid- 2360s.
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17: 00 to 5.30 pm) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe was on average 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17: 30 - 18: 00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night the first half hour of The Chase Australia achieved 520,000 spectators and 720,000 in the second half hour.
Hot seat averaging an average of 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will be confident that hot seat will prevail at 17: 30.
The Chase Australia is a million dollar replacement that failed to outstrip the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man, but whom will he choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jean-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may unwittingly see who The Bachelor wins.
The wife, where Sam Wood finally landed in the Bachelor, was filled with the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three girls left will certainly reveal whether they are the ones who received the last rose.
But when we checked out with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jean-Fellows on the day before coming out of three, you may accidentally have given a hint of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood continues to seal his lips until the final on Thursday.
All three women left themselves lyrically at why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude as the reason why they would like to be one of them.
However, when the question is asked "If not you get who should get Woods last Rose?", their answers to the spoilers could become who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jevon-Fellows and Markoski named both quickly - apart from themselves - by Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment when I went to the house and (Sarahs) and heard Sams's energy, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," Jevon-Fellows said.
"Sarah is on the earth with both feet, it is so much fun to be together with her," added Markoski.
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that they and Sam Wood are well suited to them.
In their view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood "the One."
"Once I saw him with my friends and with the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unreserved to him," she said.
And when they were asked whom Wood should choose, if not they, they were puzzling.
"I do not know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast to Ten on Wednesday, 19: 30.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open training session at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and Trainer Jim Tomole and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banished Hayne for the rest of the game when he lost a strait, as it did to the Aussie Rugby League with its first Punt-return on Tuesday of the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomic trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a punt return, and also to the current game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomic continued to show his true colours in the dressing room.
Instead of grinding his rushies to the rest of the team by the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomic strengthened Hayne also publicly after the match at his press conference.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patterned catch and cares about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patrols at a punt that was restored to the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter.
It was certainly not the start to have hoped for the Hayne and his massive Australian entourage for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the game after the Fumble and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't have a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was a thing that now occurs, one cares about the next game, and that is," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the machine to his origin in 2007, when a pass led to a Try for Queensland in its own Objective area.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and postete on his instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting to discuss the rights of the gay boys.
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian roller box with force of arms.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was arrested, his oil company seized Yukos, and his democratic efforts stopped.
The Free voters are calling for the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
"We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to protect schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we are going to get dislocations in the Bavarian education system."
The Day Freight of Free voters takes place until Friday in the Lower Franconian municipality.
In fact, other main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free voter meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will be superimposed," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the creation of UN safe zones for refugees in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"We do not go any further, we have to address the causes," said the Free voter leader.
Rejected asylum seekers want to push the Free electorate as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the management courts who are responsible for asylum actions: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticized the fact that a number of states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the Länder at the federal level."
"Bavaria pushes off, while others do not."
"We need to be more able to act."
However, the regional policy in the city of Greater Valais should not be on the table.
A long-standing long-burner remains on the agenda: There is the policy on education.
At the beginning of the year, the Minister for Culture, Ludwig Spaenle (CSU), started at 47 Gymnasia the pilot experiment "Mittelstufe plus," in which an extension of the secondary level from three to four years will be tested, and as a result will take nine years to end at the end of the school year.
But Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The issue of G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW boss.
We demand freedom of choice for all Gymnasia, which they want.
Free ride driving at G9 wherever it is desired.
Let's see what's going on.
The German stock market has closed its profits after a very broad range of leaner and nervous trading paths.
Only in the afternoon was a more festering start of the US stock exchanges, which ultimately transported the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points after the top.
The MDax medium won 0.54 percent to 19 552.88 points.
The technology-resilient TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1736,69 points.
EuroStoxx, the eurozone's flagship index, has fallen by 1.01% to 3207,60 points.
Solid profits also plummeted to the trading venues in London and Paris.
In the United States, the Dow Jones Index last reached about 1% in Plus.
Many traders expect the markets to take place on this Friday, right after the interest decision in the US, and also to a large decline on the futures exchanges.
In the meantime, the discussion about the burden of the nuclear exit has pushed the share of RWE to a record low and has also left deep scars on Eon.
According to the "mirrors" the German energy companies may be missing EUR 30 billion in reserves.
The Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered, but always lost 3.31% (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by 3.22 percent at the Dax tip.
According to a trader, a positive report was given by the US investor magazine "Barron" from the weekend.
Thus, investors have now paid too little attention to the German chip maker.
In doing so, investment in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
Car values were asked: Even in the traditionally weak month of August, more cars were removed than in the prior year, as the ACEA announced at the launch of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers issued by Autobauer Daimler and BMW stood at 1.34% and 2.21 percent.
Volkswagen benefits increased by 1.26%.
On the German bond market, the total return on federal securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50).
Rex rose by 0.12 percent to 139,55 points.
The Bund-Future lost 0.71 percent on 154,11 points.
The price of the euro in the afternoon last fell to 1.1262 dollars.
At noon, the European Central Bank set the reference rate to 1.1305 (1.1268) of the US dollar.
The dollar cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euro.
4 people killed after shooting riot at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, said one official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and bombs.
MR Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they fell back into rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets, which are known to be able to kill them, which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been held in violent conflict since the 10th century.
August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, was an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed over the centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators have voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Planning to be built in the city.
The plot at the Emder Youth Centre of Alte Post is to be rebuilt again.
The town is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - Emden - The City of Emden wants to market a about 4000 m2 plot of land in direct proximity to the Youth Centre of Alte Post.
The preparations for this are now under way.
It is planned to use the grounds for a mixture of trade, commerce and living.
You are waiting for appropriate offers, that is to say, on the part of the city.
What investor is in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no agreements have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought some of the land located on the Ringstrasse / Corner Main Street, bought it a few months ago and left the building at it.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table.
The plans for the holiday settlement at the Small sea at Emden take shape.
For the first time, the investor presented public plans for the project.
A number of trailers are further concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure time.
For months, negotiations had been conducted, debated, and drawn behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home at the Small Sea are close to Emden on the table.
The interest, the medium-sized company "System-Bau," presented its plans for the first time on Monday night in the City Development Committee of the Council.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the German Free Democratic Party, who accused investors and the management of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went to the offensive from the System-Bau management: "We have not yet got an answer to all questions," he said to the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to tackle all the rumours now.
The ten to twelve million euros of effort has been going on for months.
Violent reactions among marine owners who had come to the session gave rise to the images and new details of the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, the owner and member of the Board of Management at the representative office of the trailers, Pro Hieve, says: "This will be a gigantic poster that dominates all the rest."
In addition, it fears like a number of other project critics that transport would increase significantly by the intended size of the facility: "All the bus charges that have to come to this end," Schulz.
What exactly happens on one hectare of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There are still no operators.
"We need to have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.

Zwilling kids at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
Frankfurt zoo is looking forward to seeing young people in its Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorillas.
The last thing in a German zoo was almost 50 years back and had also been in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1967.
The sex of the new-born Gorilla twins is not yet clear, as Mother Dian has kept her closely on the body so far.
First, the "picture" had reported.
NHC says a 60% chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands.
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide low-pressure system, about 350 miles (560 km), south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60% chance to develop over the next 48 hours into a tropical cyclone.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, for example, in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, adding to the meteorological experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches the doubling donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google (Googl, O) announced a doubling donation campaign aimed at raising the $11 million for humanitarian organizations that are helping thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations, as they are fleeing from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who has fled her family from Kabul, wrote about her personal experiences when she was seven years old.
"To our trip, many dark train and bus journeys, also hungry, thirst, cold and afraid," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But, given that the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe has grown, many people, like my family, are looking desperately for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants: Médecins Sans Frontières, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million are doubled to $11 million, at $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether obese people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in the weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial for the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity levels for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven to be effective, but most studies have been carried out on people who are sick obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is regarded as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate here your BMI: 1.usa.go/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have gathered since 2007 in a study, comparing two types of obese surgery - stomach upsets and gauntlet - to medical treatment for type 2 diabetes for people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatment roughly at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% of the diabetes was partly at 28%.
In comparison with diabetes, diabetes was only at one percent and only about 2% in comparison with diabetes.
Moreover, the results of blood pressure checks, the triglyceride and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the 'surgical' group, which the authors found out.
The researchers also supervised hemoglobin, A1c, which reflected blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin, A1c, is best kept at 7%, write the researchers.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin of A1c fell from about 9% to about 6%.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But these better "glycemic control" - as you reflected in the improved hemoglobin of A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results to the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), increased returns in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1%), and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and recorded a complete escape of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was likely to die from obese people who underwent a dose of obesity, about 29% less than 15, compared to a group that tried to use conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit to the survival of surgery patients, Blackstone said that it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the process.
"It is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," without increased risk of death or a kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 with its BMI.
"I think that we are waiting for too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard."
Playing in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently being given greater attention in fiction: A young woman, at school times, unpopular and unloved, the sweat of their young people meets after years, and this falls in love with them.
Thus, also in the recently released novel "We we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hunsrück readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the countries' home countries.
The Dalai Lama mentioned the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of its tenth day visit to the United Kingdom at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics.
He demanded that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations, or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria in overcoming the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"to take care of several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long-term solutions to how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries."
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence, and also commented on George Bush's action after the terrorist attack of 11 September, and revealed that the US's violent response drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences to a letter to President Bush, and I said to him that the way forward lies in non-violence.
"I know that his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the use of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States report on a nearly 400% increase in the number of children under the age of 12, which swallow heavily alcoholic drugs, such as the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of cases of revenue to children under the age of 12 increased from 3.266 to 16.117 in 2014 from 3.266 in 2014.
"Children increasingly come to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the notary's," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children are drinking disinfectants deliberately, while some are doing to impress their friends, because of a test of social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap adventure.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-halogen water in order to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the attractive fragrances of the disinfectants.
"A child does not think that this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfecting.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapes and orange duvets, which are very appealing to children.
Hanging disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95% of alcohol.
Especially with young children, few spritzers can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, the medical director of the Giftnota call centre in the Hospital of the University of Kansas, to the station Fox 4 in Kansa City.
Well, you would not let whisky stand around, but people leave this kind of disinfectant within reach of children, and when children get there, it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a girl who has been a six-year-old girl, who recently had four spritzers at school after strawberry, was taken to the hospital in an emergency room.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, two times higher than the threshold that is considered drunk by an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated them in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was not able to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children's hospital on signs of brain trauma, because the girl had fallen by alcohol and the head had met, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products, disinfectants and means of hand disinfection beyond the scope of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, a number of disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died as a result of the swallowing of hang-disinfectants that contained a toxic ingredient that was not declared.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth grade in New York State planned to poison their "gema" teacher by issuing antibacterial products around the classroom," says a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hang-decontamination agents and verbes them out of her room.
The police viewed the failed plan as "trouble" and drew disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged.
In case of an accident on the cross-section between Nordring and Herder, a 33-year-old car driver has been slightly injured.
A 609-year-old truck driver drove on to the roundabout at the roundabout and started late that at the roundabout two cars were stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he went out with his truck to the rear of an audio track, and decided whether he would have the car on a car in front of it.
The police are involved in the vehicles involved in the accident.
The Audi of the 33-Year was no longer ready and had to be towed away.
Scaffolding kitchen: No Disharmonie at Celtic.
Griffiths plays the talk of Disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but he'll contact them again.
It will be fought by the SFA for charges of Neilson and will be cautious about January new obligations that could destroy the unit of the caste
Dons Build Leaders Over Celtic on Five Points
Adam Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a slight victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons created a five-point gap between himself and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talk about Disharmonie.
There are rumors about Disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously turned away by Griffiths.
I do not think that we feel under pressure, I think that the players are happy about it.
The lack of cover competition in Scotland's football bore Dutch - de Boer.
The Dutch football fans have said that Dutch soccer fans are interested in Celtic, because there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador to Ajax, said: "In Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why?"
It is because the rankings are not there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You are talking about the Old Firm.
They are talking about both teams, and that is what they are interested in.
There is a lot of excitement in the Old Firm games, and it is not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
Ronny Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss swear to turn things around.
After defeat with Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, defeat was followed by 10-man from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table at the top of the table with five points.
But Deila said: "Celtic already had bad times before, and we are going to get back."
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel that this is the case, but we need to go further.
We really need the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
Now it is important to stand together.
Warburton careful with January transfers
Despite its comments a few weeks ago, which suggested that he sent some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of signing new entrants and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox Kaders.
Brentford's ex-head said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this pre-season in order to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic Goal Michu with withdrawal notes
Swansea striker Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the interview, has hinted that he can withdraw when his contract expires at the Swans.
The 29 year-old has been plagued with a annoying ankles for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA Battle for Neilsons's Comments
The Hearts led 2: 1 when Paterson was sent by the field, and then 3: 2, but the Red card of the defender was later lifted - the third red card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months, was removed.
Neilson remains what he said, and he insists: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid tynecks.
The incorruptible Hibee was reprimanded after he admitted that he had sung a song with offensive lyrics at the ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel, which was offensive.
The incident occurred in a tavern in the area of Roseburn of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the striker, adding: "It is certain to say that I am not returning to Tynecastle when it does not play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United Management.
Simon Donnelly insists that the Board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around, but admits that its demise will have to end on the pitch.
I think that Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the guys back on track," said Donnelly.
Mcllnes is happy to "win" Hamilton "unpleasantly."
Derek Mcnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight desperately for Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them a margin of five points before Celtic at the top of the table, thanks to Adam Rooneys Elfm, the first half of the table.
McDonalds said: "There is no team that has won everything, in games or leagues, which have not won such games."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 164,000, while the number of people without work to the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was above the UKs of 5.5%, such as the figures of the National Statistics Office (S).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% over the quarter - a number above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland took the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we have seen further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment.
It was the end of the process that was disturbing.

Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma?
Somewhat late today, with the exception of a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope that it will not happen, I will sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glosip is executed by the Giftspritze.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation already started in January about its best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day closer, I began to fear me.
So why should I do it?
I voted because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and as applications are often available as places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Anyone who is selected will be able to watch it emotionally.
I cannot do that.
I am sitting next to Richard Glossips, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone numbers and two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I am not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
That is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and receive access.
I complained to her about it.
They admitted that they "it could have been better," but they still think that it is wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things that I said and wrote.
He does not tell me what I have to write, and I would not do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that public relations will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I have made.
I am not going to dwell on all the details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Mr Corbett is innocent.
His actions following the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a benefactor.
But I believe that there is a strong probability that it is not guilty.
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters whom you can use to do so.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death.
The canning river kills a man who is chasing the Canning River.
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when he overtook the man of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man of Perth to hang off the police was unsuccessful when he was in a shallow and marshy water, a few metres from a police officer who tried to "persuade him gently to return to the bank."
The police of Canning Vale was set up on Tuesday at a peace settlement incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspects, he tried to escape to them in the direction of Canning River.
But it did not go too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I not come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates."
"Sometimes people do funny things to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins took a car in the trench to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired indigenous people to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race.
Peter Moody claims that the stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He directed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing, and found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt drum of Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had been arrested for 18 months on charges of espionage and did not want it to "look like too many grapes."
"I had nothing to say about it," said Moody.
You know that it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home this evening and sleep well.
I want to walk around, and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them.
If they start to think that I do not, I should not be more coach.
I then have to consider what I am doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department tried to spy on his stall.
"eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am being asked - and offered to provide him with a job in my stables to deliver information about what I am doing in my stables, said," said Moody on Racing.com.
You seem to believe that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should certainly take their noses because they have failed in the attempt to take me.
Robert Roulette, Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of the RVL, were conscious of it and are still today.
Should I think that it is going to be personal?
Did the RVL behave in a cowardly manner and do people outside of trainers in charge of what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Perhaps the people out there think that I am.
Perhaps they need to take my licence and break me, and I have no doubt that what I say allows them to think about it now.
But I have now reached the point where I do not care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I am going to put pressure on them and urge them to take a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The training levels of the trainer have been built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late Scratching led him to say that he "could throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the undefeated master of Black Caviar, referred to the race treating rule "laughable," after a packet of mud or clay had been applied to the horses, which violated the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing sports.
I have to take full responsibility for this,' he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been that last night.
It could have been so yesterday, which was also the case.
It also had it on the day of the race.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race.
It is a joke.
People who draw up these rules know nothing about the horse.
"we all see that we need rules, but we have gone too far," said Moody.
Man After Drivers of the Road
The police arrested a man at the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequently cursed in Cobram.
The helicopter was delivered to the Royal Melbourne hospital with heavy injuries after it was taken by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the car driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned to Shepparton.
It is expected to be indicted for curling and reduced assistance and for other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy beats rivals for claims to ring fights back.
Black-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has described criticism of the Tackling of its players as a "agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the referee allowed the Storm players to "wrestling" with his team during the High Storm victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane's coach, Wayne Bennett, made a barely disguised comment about the Storm team after his team won the Final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, called the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the rings.
Bellamy defended the ball of his team and said that they were concentrated on their "contact" at the Tackling.
Bellamy added that the critique of two leading trainers at his team was confident of him, because it means that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This repeatedly occurs - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling when they beat us at 24: 2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real priority, and that has been a trend for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he is unlikely to get used to it, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always appears at this time of the year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennetts" idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring football."
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He has likened his game to our game on Friday night, and how exciting the game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that St George was criticized as a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said that he would care about a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially among its young players at its speed.
This is the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like them.
I have more faith in it because they are saying these things, because they are a little concerned about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they did not think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game of Storm against ROOSTERS achieved a better result than the game of Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably a good game, I have not yet looked at it, but what was the outcome?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two more experiments in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks and are not points something exciting?
For me it is the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we are going to meet them at one stage.
The Storm team has free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the pre-finals in the AAMI Park.
Compete with 200,000 dollars of deposit after buying drugs.
A man who may be threatened with a life sentence because of his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kg of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released for a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America through Vanuatu and headed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watching to see how he met his colleagues at the marina during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially viable punishment for the attempt to have a commercial volume of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to have the entire crowd, and that the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape by Maksimovic.
It has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
When it came to the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 to secure his release.
"After reading the reasonable explanations of the two people, it is clear that the imposition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him not to appear, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail under the conditions under which he gives his Australian and Serbian passports, is reported to the police daily and is kept at an initial lock from 18: 00-06: 00.
Accident at A5 near Karlsruhe: Company that splits apart.
A truck driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe.
Two of the three lorries involved had slowed to a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn to the left at the last minute, as the police indicated.
The operator's house of the accident creator was completely divided.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe Nord was closed completely over six hours to 2.
The amount of damage was caused by the amount of EUR 122,000 million.
Stevan Hogg used the phone of girls to attract paedophiles to send images.
A paedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl when it fell, logged into an online messaging service from which he received a number of unacceptable images of children who were sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked at it, found the confusing news and alerted her mother immediately.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, analyzed then computers that were found under the address, and found "concerned" web searches, which used terms for searching for decent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet, and then "vored to be a policeman to scare them."
The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said that it would be an addiction, that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer had been conducted by him, but said that it was because he wanted to claim to be a policeman in order to scare paedophiles.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person, who sent the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said that he did it to attract them.
He said that he was sick when he drinks, and said that he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
MS Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the lemon and on the wine.
She then also looked at the indecent images on the phone and confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used computers and Playstation to speak to girls who looked much younger than they were.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, is guilty of the indictment of having recorded indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, to have violated the conditions on 25 January this year and did not appear before the courts to be held at a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg should not appear in the register of sexual offenders, because it could be argued that no significant sexual element could be found in its transgression.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael left the judgment until October in order to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted in this case, but it was held in custody because of hearings on other outstanding cases.
It was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Locks allowed at small border crossings to Germany.
More and more refugees are taken up away from the major points of control on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers, out of fear of discovery and arrest, have increased people at smaller border crossings.
On the Austrian side, a spokesman said to the Federal Police.
Along the border river Inn have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday, more than 1000 refugees.
They were at the foot of the German side by walking over bridges and dams.
There they are taken by the Federal Police and passed on to the registration.
At the Munich Main Station, according to Federal Police Data, much more refugees met on Wednesday, compared to the start of the week.
When around 700 people arrived in the provincial capital only until 8 am, one speaker said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of checks at the German-Austrian border, the city had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Expansion of tropical storm "Henry" in the southwest is expected.
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Because of a low pressure area above Western Europe, currents of warm sea air are now flowing into the land, divided by the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart.
The strong was the boom of the tropical storm "Henry," which was pulled over the Atlantic in the last few days by the Bermuda Islands.
Intense storms and thunderstorms are expected above all in Baden.
According to DWD, until Thursday morning, also in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and on the shore of land is expected to take 60 to 90 hours per hour.
On Friday, therefore, the sun will go out again.
The mass makes the difference: Every two years, the coaches at the IAA show their novelties.
In 2015, there is mainly movement in the car cars, which currently sell well at the moment.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: 28.1 percent of new registrations were in this segment only in August only in August.
This is also reflected at the IAA (audience days 17 to 27 September).
This year, all of the futuristic concept cars and new luxury cars will be presented to a large number of new compact models.
One of the greatest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at traders in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It is at the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive.
Opel has a start to the biggest competitor of VW Golf, which will start at EUR 17 650.
The current Astra costs are at the end of EUR 16 990.
The Astra has a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW / 100 HP.
In addition, the Hessen offers further diesel and petrol engines of 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / 200 PS, to which for the first time also count for three-cylinder petrol.
Unlike the main competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only a fifth of its competitors.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the Kombi, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And what's going to be done next to the Astra at the IAA at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is going to send the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane.
At the fair, the Mégane is to be seen exclusively as a fifth in a conventional and sporting GT version.
In the trade, he comes to the beginning of next year, then as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new to the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan boom wants to find its position in the strong growing segment.
The compact Infiniti fits into the brand's design line with its curved lines.
The basic model will get a gas/petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 HP.
In the offer, there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: The Suzuki Baleno segment, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt, is also new in the segment.
The model is offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0 litre turbo engine and a capacity of 82 kW / 111 HP.
The maximum torque is according to manufacturer specifications of 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: The compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA, has been completely renewed.
On the other hand, designers of the noble Citroën laid hand in hand in front of the front part, where the radiator was redrawn, while the changed headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was upgraded, reducing the number of buttons by a touchscreen and integrating Apple's Carplay for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants are offered at the IAA in the compact class, including Mercedes A-Class (Mercedes) or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin Tegel: 5 m2 of cells are degrading.
The Federal Constitutional Court was right to provide an ex-detainee of the law enforcement station Tegel, who had been placed into a small cell for months.
Due to the violation of their dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells.
This has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the people concerned can even hope for money when they have been locked up for a few days in which they were locked up in the close spaces (Az: 1 BvR 1127/14).
A former prisoner was successful in Karlsruhe with his constitutional license: He was placed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space in a single cell in a single cell in the office between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated in space.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, was now left at free, was transferred to a larger cell.
While he was arrested due to the undignified conditions of detention of the country of Berlin, he was failing to do so.
However, the Constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Court of Berlin and rejected the case again.
They are violations of the human dignity of the man.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, the period in question only gave rise to a couple of days for the compensation, if there was any compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, it would be "a fear of the legal protection of the personality."
The Chamber now needs to clarify the level of currency damage.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
They only promised a prisoner of prisoner in April, because he was locked up naked in a cell.
According to a decision by 2011, according to a decision by 2011, also is the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet.
In addition, on Wednesday, the Berlin Constitutional Court, which was certified by a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009, confirmed a humane accommodation.
The then plaintiff was placed between 15 to 21 hours a day over three months, between 15 to 21 hours, in a similar cell as in the area of Karlsruhe.
The Berlin prisons have also been in the headlines for lack of staff over the last few weeks.
Prisoners are thus always included 23 hours, and the aggressiveness is rising, even thugs are supposed to have come already because of the tense situation.
There are 21 posts in Tegel due to lack of talent, 19 are to be removed in 2016.
Angela Merkel, and refugee policy: "We are creating that."
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to adopt them.
What is going on in Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers are expected to be in Germany this year, according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, as Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) states that Germany is even able to absorb one million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) demonstrated determination in light of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can create that, and we create it."
What is to come to Germany gives the following overview.
What is needed, according to different forecasts between 350,000 (the estimate of the Department of the Federal Ministry) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel-Institute), are used every year - for the next five years.
This is almost twice the amount that has been built (250000 homes).
The shortage of housing, however, is dramatic in the case of affordable rental properties: 60 000 to 80000 out of rental prices are falling annually, and these particularly cheap homes are going to apply to refugees.
For this reason, Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) intends to double its funding, from the current EUR 518 million to EUR 1 billion.
There is far too little evidence of this from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 of the social housing per year would have to be created, and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion a year in this effort.
The scientists and the Federal Minister for the Interior agree that there should also be more fiscal advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it can be assumed that, in the long term, 55% of the poultry in Germany can work.
However, the refugees in Germany would not systematically be asked about their qualifications in order to help them, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
But it is vital for refugees to be integrated into Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to the appreciation of the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migrant researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround: From the prohibition of work to the recognition of work.
Whereas previously a working ban on asylum seekers existed from up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, just like the residence permit that limits asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, partly because of the shortage of resources, the majority of the population has accepted that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A large hurdle for access to the labour market is a lack of German language.
Up to now, there is not yet a sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts.
Thus, the building of networks is, in the view of Thränhardt, the gateway to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has noticed that only a handful of parents who have fled are giving their children to the kite, estimated ten to 15 percent of them: "For the uprooted parents it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, speaker for youth and family in the administration of Berlin.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the Kita, the administration distributes handslips in different languages.
If the need for female educators grows significantly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would seek to increase training capacity - for example, by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students are prepared for instruction classes without knowledge of German.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers, who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20% of the refugees want to study in Germany.
As a matter of principle, no country for asylum or for study has been banned - the only exception has been Berlin, and the interior designer Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned its position.
Student willing refugees could be relieved of access to the university.
Refugees who have a residence permit or tolerance do not receive benefits according to the law on asylum seekers when they start to study.
In principle, the latter are not given a Bafög, because they do not fall within the circle of people who are entitled to drink.
Patient refugees have thus far had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be free, from 1 January 2016, shortening the span to 15 months.
The funding gap also needs to be closed down, Steffen Krach, Berlin's Secretary of State for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk are asking for it.
Students should get straight to Bafög.
Islam will continue to play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should give Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing state of churches of a new state religion.
It would also be important to create an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the newcomers professionally.
They also have a duty to do so.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree to clear partners and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas.
This also involves being willing to take decisive action to combat religious fundamentalism.
The Chairman of the Muslim Democratic Council, Aiman Mazyek, said on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be recorded to Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "are immediately entitled to be here, in Germany," said he in Bayrischer Rundfunk.
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will continue to be a matter of all the society in the future.
This will also have to change the majority society, which makes the reduction of discrimination and racism more urgent.
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti-discrimination unit for a decade and a general equality law.
But it learns very slowly, as demonstrated by the NSU murder series in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and interest groups of non-white German have been demanding for a long time, and what international agreements, such as the anti-racism convention, are binding on Germany, will have to become a reality over the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new opportunities to its new citizens - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to supply the refugees who have been expected to provide medical care.
"When it comes to man- power and capacities, we can create that, as it said.
However, additional money should go into the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for all arrivals to hand off health cards immediately.
Services provided could later be settled with the Länder.
And, in the long term, it is highly questionable to eat as many people with the limited performance catalogue that the law on asylum seekers is going to see.
Apart from that, doctors are mainly trying to create language barriers.
Up to now, as the Berlin Health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated, migrants are educated about their illness than other patients.
It is not only in clinics, even in doctors" practices, that interpreting costs should be accepted.
Help would also help many refugees, however, even with more general medical contact points in the emergency hospital.
And with a different diagnostic view.
Among the refugee children, for example, there is much more untreated disabilities, and the young people are concerned with the HIV education system.
Montgomery Scott was a Starfleet officer who was assigned to the USS Enterprise.
"Parasites or tuberculosis are not so hard to see," and as far as doctors are concerned, the refugees may even have some relief in sight.
The Syrians would have a developed educational system, a number of refugees that were even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and perhaps re-evaluate them.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are estimated to be mentally ill according to the German Federal Patent Office (BPtK): Most of them are suffering from a posttraumatic and traumatic stress or depression.
Particularly vulnerable are refugee children, explained Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that each of the fifth Syrian refugee refugees is traumatized in Germany.
Whoever is ill with a post-traumatic stress disorder suffers from, among other things, flashbacks with breathing, dizziness, heart disease, and death fears.
Further symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong horror, and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, if early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only 4% of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum seekers are able to set a motion for psychotherapy in the Social Offices, it usually lasts several months.
What is more, in the social services, agents or doctors, who are not trained for mental illness, would decide whether or not a treatment is necessary.
This often leads to misjudgments, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream!
With the new "passion" of production, the circus takes up the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw any age group in the spell of fascinating acrobatics, to draw animal pairs and one-to-one entertainment.
Now the circus invites you to dream of the manege on the bricks.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine how to live without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chef.
"Passion" - under this motto, current management stage.
For more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the family.
Thus, the family is inspired by the gift of the family.
"It is important to get people away from their everyday straw and bring them to a completely different world for two hours," said 27-year-old junior junior officer.
Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept "a cocktail with world town flair."
50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometers of tour can experience this flair now.
The circus programme convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft as well.
With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo will be able to capture all.
Lightness and agility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art is supposed to conquer women's hearts during the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salads, the acrobatics of the circus also fascinate with a sense of sensitivity and strength.
Balancing the unicycle on a ball?
There is no problem for He Yuan.
Snake people also fascinate and scare.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics and is fascinated by its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect.
"Animals are part of our family," says Stephanies mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuses in the position of circus animals are too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes a position: "If our animals do not go well, we are not doing well either."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match unit.
The "four-legged artists," as they are lovingly called, are possible according to the possibility of any desire by the eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun.
If the animal does not feel comfortable, it doesn't want it either.
What is important, then, is to ensure that animals are good.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland ponypheng and a zebra, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," Brigitte Probst told.
Zebroid is not ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the circus.
It is something that is likely to be something for each visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst, "no matter if five or 1 200 viewers, we are always our best.
The circus invites you at 17 and 20 per day from 17 to 20 September.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11 and 16.
Thursday is family day, the prices are reduced for the presentation at 5 am.
Animal viewing is open daily from 10: 00 to 18: 00.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes a false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down to the steps at the beginning of the year.
It remained offensive, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
The opening of Parliament has also been tarnished by allegations by Members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mugabe with calls for fines.
Last month, they ordered him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - that is the speech he reiterated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they warned against disturbing Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title of death," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament that immunity ends in Parliament, and as soon as it leaves Parliament, that its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerns" at the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is going to cut up to 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will be split up this year into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected job losses lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"The restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who is supposed to lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of shops that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual sales, and "is focused on the supply of unrivaled, integrated technology solutions for companies," so a statement made by the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electric equipment whose Palo Alto garage was called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to overcome the move from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the major US companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates have to stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb.
Wenger emphasized to Wilshere that it was only September and that his rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan, that there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss the next four games for England, and in the light of its history, its participation in the European Championship next summer certainly remains uncertain.
The great shame on this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre-season.
"this kind of injury does not threaten career," said Wenger.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
This is not a major issue.
This was just a matter of an accident.
It was not in connection with his buttons or the injuries he had before.
This may be purely medical, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the danger of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an uncomfortable pattern.
The study by Premier injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 League games during the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007/08 since 2007/08, one of the two Premier League clubs.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the vulnerability rate will continue during the last season.
"sometimes, when you return to a violation, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and win combat power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and that he will pursue a career of the kind that he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before playing at Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in lieu of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players who need a little pause," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites, by group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unchallenged after 41 games after the "unconquered bar" campaign was started in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, on the Richter scale of 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal has drawn the lesson of the past season with the Champions League capitulation of Monaco and has been driven by the distant hope to lead the club to its first Europapokal triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never folded at Arsenal.
We were very close to that in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in the business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not a dreamer.
FriendsFest: The comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships.
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially with regard to how the need for men to open has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men show at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death for men aged between 20 and 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common to men than to women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign against a wretched life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the goal of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need them.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight in order to rise to this challenge.
A recent study at more than 2,000 high school pupils with symptoms of depression found that when the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", its chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends are halving the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on style about substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, viable and successful, even if the reality is dominated by isolation.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists refer to in particular values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper effect on our mental health.
And, as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really cannot buy money.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, who distinguished by the interaction as a friend.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hubris, moments at the football look in cozy chairs, and the yearning of Ross to Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it anyway, even if they often reserve themselves to explore fully their feelings.
As a member of the telephone team explained to me, "My listening role has really been shown to people who feel depressed and who are suicidal."
The men who contact us often feel unable to speak to friends.
The old saying "I am right" has an enormous impact, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when one speaks openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer longer-term response mechanisms.
She clearly presents the little moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone might also help people in sight of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, when you visit comedy Central FriendsFest at this weekend with the scenery that is totally new to the day, do not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see Starbucks sitting alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest.
Di Maria meets to help to help PSG to crush Malmö.
Angel Di Maria is celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to prepare to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who led the French champion, but after that, she missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead, as Cavani reached a headball-tor during the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk, even in the group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, because they are striving not only for the qualification for the knock-out rounds, but for an improvement on the way to the quarter-final in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn't a class game of Laurent Blancs team, with Zlatan Ibrahimovics, who missed opportunities before the gate, as he was changed later in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career as early as in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it is a good start, 2: 0 to create problems and look back to our enemies, even if there are certain things that we need to perfect in the course of the season," said Blanc.
"That is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not have one or two other goals."
After he was injured, he returned to the Paris team by three changes that could hold a 2: 2 undecided on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League, although he was stabbed by Di Maria during the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was designated as the man who was able to take the PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, when he entered Marco Verrattis's pass behind the Malmö defense before passing by Johan Wiland to Johan Wiland, he turned to the long edge of the network.
If someone believed that PSG was going to win a big victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, which beat Celtic in a play-off in order to reach this level, entered the field at Anpiff with nine national players, and was ranked by a five-man defense and two deep in the middle.
But in addition to a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed by far to Kevin Trapps post in the 34th minute, she provided little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes relied on some misps and bad connections, not least of Ibrahimovic, who at no less than five attempts in the first half of the first half patched and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after restarting.
Nevertheless, he demonstrated a lot more of skill when he brought his fellow players to the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic, who turned Di Maria into a shooting passing by Wiland in the 52nd minute of the post...
The second goal was finally thanks to Cavani.
The end result was that Malmö was able to return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the end result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was detected at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegians said: "Our last Champions League game was last December in December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualification games are not enough."
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!

Xavi: PEP Guardiola prevented 2008 changes to FC Bayern.
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
The FC Bayern was apparently a few years ago, just before the obligation of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona at that time.
Eight times of Spanish champion, three times Pokal, four times Champions League winners, two times Club World Champion, two times European champion, one World Champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to al-Sadd Sports Club to Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi now tells us that he was already leaving Barcelona before the end of 2008.
"She told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at that time," he says.
And the German also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was a offer of Bavaria.
"Rummenigge wanted to have me."
Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern in the summer of 2008.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change.
However, the change failed to materialize.
And the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champion: PEP Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça took Guardiola under the contract and I've played a great EM."
"PEP told me that I would not alternate that he could not imagine the team without me."
"That's what he got me."
Who knows how Bavaria's season 2008/2009 would have run with Xavi?
Xavi was in cash at the quarter-final of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the grass, turned out the Red (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated its end at the end of the royal classes triumph.
Matt Damon plays variety in film creation
Matt Damon confronted the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a debate about the variety and said that she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night of HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, with regard to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"When we talk about diversity, then do it at the cast of the film and not at the filling of the show," assured Damon.
Brown was shocked by insulting disbelief, and called "Hoo!
Damon and Brown joined the producers of Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I would like to ask people to think about it," said Brown, whoever to treat the director as he treats the figure of the Harmony.
The only black person, and she is a Nutte who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People fought for the Finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights at the film; Damon replied that "at the end there could be something we do not want."
When the debate was aired, social media exploded before disapproval of Damons's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni pressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in space, so he can explain their diversity - that is SO WEISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 Retweets and 4,000 Likes since its release.
Damons's comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
When the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement acted nationally nationally and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against Farsi.
In February, the singer made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Album still matte" (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter have published a statement in response to the question of Fox News hero Elisabeth Hasselbeck, who should be viewed as a hate group.
"Network Black Lives Matter is a love group," said the leader.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior is crowned by the first Champion.
Professional sports climbers and operator help Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $1 million.
The competition show, which closed its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season, there were two men, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten, until the final.
The last task was to climb on a 75 foot rope climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time, which was the first athlete to complete the exhausting Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero ended the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero talked to E, news after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of profit of the Grand Prix of 1 million dollars.
"I mean, it is amazing to think that I have never earned more than $10,000," said Isaac E!
Suddenly, as I cannot even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
The lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final, and why Britten, despite the fact that he ended the course first, was not given any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than a finalist, it gets the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and changes life, it gets the great gradation.
I do not think that he has any resentment.
He is so happy to have what he has done.
He was awarded masses of prizes by fans.
He's a great guy and a father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I should be beaten by someone, I am glad that it is Isaac."
And I think that Isaac would have felt the same way if they had swapped the roles.
The America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the filming will start in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are passing by Minnesota's Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS-- The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously, they were one of the best teams in baseball.
The Tigers were reduced to their role as spoilers, but on Tuesday they played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins was a chance for the rise within a match of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard.
For Detroit, if only for an evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word, which was so hard to grasp across a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories do fun, no matter how it comes," said tiger manager, Brad Ausmus.
Tiger Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Innings, then in the sixth, and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) beat you up 6 times in the 1/3 innings and enabled three Runs.
It was its third successful start in its last nine matches.
"I want to stop this year strongly," said Simon.
It is hard to throw all the game in the Bullpen, and so I will concentrate on the game.
The designated Tiger Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two Runs, his first from mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"It has well curved the drum," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (percussion), he clearly looked better out of the bullcup, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three Runs in the back at the end of seventh Innings, the Twins had their best chance to return to the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left field.
Right Fielder, Aaron Hicks, reached a Bunt, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to Strikeout before he was replaced by the left-winged Blaine Hardy.
Hardy, the only man he was confronted with, was in front of the designated Rookie drummer Miguel Sano, who cut a two-run to the border of Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe into a double play.
It was the 27th time in this season in the Major League that Plouffe beat a double play.
After Detroit added a service-run at the end of the ninth interior, the wall set up a RBI double against the closer of the tiger Bruce Rondon and reached the level of 5-4.
However, at three rows for his fifth Sano, at the same time, Sano performed at Sano.
Detroit is one of the most powerful drivers in the world.
The tiger achieved three Runs in the first two Innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed from the vulnerability list before the game, after missing more than a month because of the back of the game.
"Obviously, the start I've desired, Hughes said," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable than I sat down and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches in the third inning."
After having received the Leadoff Batter, Humps gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez to the game, who managed to create a single "middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos was followed by a single on the right side, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third, ending the threat.
The tiger went to the second, achieved a one-Out Double of Catcher James McCann and a two-out Single by Center Fielder Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
"That was a great blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He has not done well, but he has got the right job.
Hughes was in a pitch-Count, did not score points in the third before he was replaced by the relever.
At Hughes it came to three Runs with six hits and a walk with four Strikeouts.
Notes: Tiger RHP Anibal Sanchez left for a breach of the Wurfschulter.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the work of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August, on the vulnerability list, should be activated for the start of Wednesday.
Using Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris will be removed from the vulnerability list to launch the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four Starbucks with the tiger since it was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July.
It has been missing since 20 August because of a tie in the right hip joint.
The Tiger and the Twins will end their series of three games on the Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) is going to play against Minstrotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4,73).
Hundreds of refugees are supposed to suffer in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected on Wednesday for the night.
The people involved in it are then to be housed in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden, such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday night.
It was expected to receive 450 to 750 refugees.
Several sporting halls of the Hesse state capital were prepared for this case over the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees are able to enter there temporarily.
They are to be distributed to other communities.
In the last ten days alone, the Heads of State of Gießen, 7500 people in Hessen, who were responsible for the first shot, had arrived.
Also Frankfurt and Hanau have set up temporary accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ishinger: German military action in Syria an option.
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, holds military action with German involvement in Syria for one possibility.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options cannot take place without Germany," said he.
He accused the European states of "a collective vision of a collective nature."
Four years ago, one could have been pleased that the kelch of a military presence in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is hitting our door," said he on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees.
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also started to introduce controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, said on Tuesday night in Austria that no one should be sent back to Hungary.
Germany, too, have not sent refugees back to Austria.
"No, that is agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement in which Germany could host a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
Concrete figures did not refer to them and referred to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin.
Over the last few days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague, Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders applied for a special summit next week.
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU Ministers for the Interior want to take a new start to the binding distribution of a further 120 000 refugees next Tuesday (22 September).
In the face of the strong refugee population in Germany, the Federal Government wants to give stronger support to countries in the initial intake and distribution of the people.
The Bund will manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel late on Tuesday night after almost four-hour consultations with the prime ministers at the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those who needed protection would also get it.
But those who do not have a lead perspective cannot remain in Germany either.
This perception was strongly shared by the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now have to deal with a "huge force."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its border to Serbia at its 175 kilometer long road on Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government announced in Budapest, including the border with Romania, with a fence.
This neighbouring country, unlike Serbia, is part of the EU.
Hungary wanted to prevent traffickers seeking escape routes from Romania, Hungary's Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said to the planned new border fence.
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, meanwhile, eyewitness reports indicate that thousands of other migrants are moving to the Greek border.
Raumsonde "Cassini" finds Ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus.
Under the ice-cream of the Saturnmoon Enceladus, a global ocean splashes.
This includes researchers from observations of the "Cassini" rooms.
Thus, the Moon is slightly swapped on its orbit around the ring planks.
Although this tug movement is small, it is too great for a constantly stable celestial body in a communication by the Cornell University in Ithaca (New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus."
It has already been known that the ice cover of Enceladus has to have liquid water.
Thus, in 2006, "Cassini" discovered ice volcanoes at the southern pole of the Saturnmoon, discovered the water vapour and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole, there should be an underground sea, the astronomers at that time.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama is missing in 1860 Munich several weeks.
The 1860 Munich has to give up about one month on the offensive player Valdet Rama.
An investigation showed that there was an adulation by the 27-year-old.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to the Munich lions, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced break."
"We find this difficult, Rama is a loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," said SportDirector Necat Aygün of the "Bild" newspaper, with a view to the possible obligation of a united pro.

No Diet Fruit - Mangos contain plenty of sugar.
Mangoes are exotic and juicy.
But those who want to pay attention to their lean line are often discouraged by them.
Mangoes contain a lot of sugar - especially sucrose.
They are healthy: In them, they contain B vitamins, vitamins and, above all, mangoes, but a lot of vitamin A and its pre-phase beta carotene.
Anyone who eats the fruits thus supports vision, the immune system, and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smash.
The shell colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet dishes.
A mango also gives a hearty meal a special note.
It balances the slightly bitter taste of some of the leaf salts such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well to fish, poultry, lamb and game.

The next night breaks in the valleys of the Alpine north side of the hair dryer, as MeteoSwitzerland announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the hairdryer partly blows with storm strength through the apron valleys.
After arriving on Thursday morning, we are crossing a prominent cold front, which brings heavy rainfall, wind gusts and a drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest run.
On the northern side of the Alps, the night breaks through the valleys on the day of Wednesday.
The result of the wind is blowing from 60 to 100 km/h (60 to 100 km/h), to some, and especially in the Urnerland, with more than 100 km/h in the Urnerland.

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square.
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now Martin Luther place in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday, a nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on behalf of the German reformator.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as "German theologian of the Reformation."
The park lies in the very heart of Rome, next to the Colosseum.
The name was sought by the work community of the Protestant Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, the pastor of the Evangelish-Lutheran community in Rome, reminded them that in the town of popes, over centuries as a minority, the Protestants have often only been able to live their faith in secret.
With the place, it becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome.
Martin Luther (1433-1546) was held as a young Augustinian monks around the year 1510/11 for a few months in Rome.
He found the city to be a scapegoat at the time.
His negative impressions are expected to have reinforced him in his subsequent struggle against Rome.
Luther had then started to divide the church.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible.
Jesus with the (gold-plated) village krone is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
What was the start of the word?
No, not to the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs has formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has received the 75 year-old - but that is not synonymous with "fun."
On the contrary, it is true that the respective subjects are adapted.
Around three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his bible project, for which he has taken a subjective-artistic selection of the many topics of the "book of all books."
The result are cycles that are dedicated to topics such as the crossing, the precursors, the precepts or the fades.
Thus he has spontaneously captivated several partners: This applies to the Luther Verlag with its theological orientation as well as for the Kettler-Verlag with its emphasis on art books.
And there is the author, Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of painting, has studied the Bible in the Bible.
He interpreted the Bible texts chosen by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alts Painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist, who here formulates his personal thoughts about the respective situation.
The jewelry band has golden letters.
Thus, the 75 year-old gives a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the catalyst for the bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode, grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"Education already happened with the tubular stock," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to do that, and perhaps I can stand again with the Lord."
His second concern was to make art more important in a fast-paced time: "The perception of educational worlds is now shaped by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is pushed aside.
Artists have a different desire to show things.
Images always have some secrets and are not decorative.
"In this respect I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to drop into the pictures, let them work, discover and feel the power they have: "the image is looking at its counterpart."
On Tuesday, at the presentation of the Otmar Alt-Bible in the Otmar Altepost, Klaus Altepost set out to be "always" a lover of Otmar Alts's art: "I like how he sees with his pictures."
Old did not take care to capture the Bible fully, but selected the subjects that are important for him.
"This was not cooperation on an eye level," says Altepost: "There are images that are explained here," says Altepost.
For Hans Möhler of Luther Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Alts's images speak for Möhler (Biblical) as well as the language of love.
Some of the originals - paper and screen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Otmar Alt-Foundation.
Breaking the Road for BMX Rail
Plans made to be found, companies were given the task of modeling the earth for a circular course: A year later almost everything was finished - yet even before the official opening of the BMX track, it has already ended.
There were failures in politics and administration, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
That's why it was possible to find new places, with formal planning and application for construction permission.
The approval will take place in October, the first councillor, Sabine Mosebach-Bock, was now able to inform the children and youth committee.
"I hope that this year still happens to happen," she said.
It should start with the work of the former indoor pool without having "more memorial break."
DFB is intensifying engagement with refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees by 2019, and the Bundesliga will send out a clear signal at the weekend.
The football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and ensures its help in dealing with the problems facing us.
"I think this is our country's greatest challenge since reunification."
"In principle, no one can say that nothing is at fault, I have nothing to do with it."
"This should be of interest to anyone," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he intends to discuss the refugee situation intensively in Germany.
"I am the chancellor next Wednesday and I am going to meet the Minister for the State of Özğuz and the German Chancellor."
"The subject will certainly have a central role to play," he announced.
The football can and will help.
However, the decisive course has to be set for politics.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its Refugee Initiative "1: 0 for a Welcome" by four years.
"We ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," explained Niersbach at the margins of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's and Malta's.
Some countries also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional associations are sending out a clear signal when they are going to bear the pressure "We help."
"We also want to make it clear that everybody should help where and how they can only be," said Leverkusens Sportchef Rudi Völler of the "Image" newspaper (Tuesday), describing the project as "self-evident."
"The refugee drama is going to everyone, no one should look away."
"We can support football, no, we need to use our beam capacity, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig talked about a "prominent sign of the league."
The national qualification game against Hungary this Friday, the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football."
It is great that all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their places.
It is just as great that small and small clubs are active.
The message "1: 0 for a Welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.
"It is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and the next year, the association is providing EUR 300 000 000 for the integration of refugees, along with the DFB and the Federal Government.
"The clubs have already retrieved the entire sum for 2015," reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP Management Board loses an eye in the event of an accident.
According to several reports, the Chief Executive of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost the left eye with a fall at the beginning of July.
During the accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the United States, after midnight, he had fallen to a water glass that he bore in the left hand, reporting the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He is almost dead, he was powerless, she then moved out to the street - that's what he tells us last week," the "Wiwo" quotes "WiWo" SAP founder Hasso Plattner.
However, McDermott could pursue his work.
"At the beginning of October, we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was fully operational at the meeting.
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday) that he will return to Germany in October and will continue to run the software group.
"I am fully in my job for SAP."
"Of course, I was always in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner," said McDermott.
McDermott usually commences between Germany and the US, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important for him to get to the public with such a personal history, said the manager of the "SZ": "Everyone can do something like that."
"It is important to stand up again when you have fallen."
The team will be pleased to announce that the team will be able to...
Magnesium emailed a photo and declared that he had suffered injury when he was overthrown by the wheel.
It is also a matter of doubt when it comes to the weekend in Singapore as soon as it is going to be considered to be a reserve, just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BvB without Reus towards Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the Gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have been shattered definitively.
The national player will be missing to the team leader of the football Bundesliga also in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00) / Sky.
"We cannot use it," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be taking place on Sunday at the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen, the BVB coach was open: "We expect him to return to Friday with a return."
Due to the heavy load of its pros, Tuchel will not only change its base on the Reus location.
Thus he announced a change to the goalkeeper position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the soccer teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller can be used in all European League matches in the future, however, Tuchel has been open.
He will be able to play the second game as well.
He also said that it was possible to find a way to ensure that the final suit for the BVB in the Europe League should be the goal.
"I think that we have a good chance to get the title off."
Robotics Cars: The Government aims to lead Germany.
According to the will of the German Government, Germany is supposed to be the driving force behind the transformation of the car technology.
The Federal Reserve decided on Wednesday a strategy paper of the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides for investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt was speaking at the edge of the Automesse IAA in Frankfurt on Wednesday at the end of a "new mobility era."
Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and will ensure less traffic congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also intends to discuss the subject with its G7 counterparts, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Department of Transport highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband and a rapid turnaround on digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is being built on the highway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to avoid imposing additional liability risks to the driver, the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments.
Germany, for example, wants to ensure that the permissible maximum speed for self-driving cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government is also in favour of a change to the Vienna Convention, which thus far only provides for the man as a driver.
When it comes to automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, while the driver becomes more and more about the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics, high-speed driving on motorways by 2020 will be technically possible.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles are to be expected on public roads "only after 2020."
The added value of the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German location value the authors of the study for 2025 at around EUR 8.4 billion.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to the greater safety and efficiency of road traffic," said the SPD traffic politician, Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data should clearly be clarified.
Still, Germans are skeptical about cars - much more than French or Americans.
A survey submitted by the Forum of Forsa-Institut on Wednesday by the Forsa Institute, on behalf of the Institute of Testing, comes to the conclusion that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be established over the next decade, 32 per cent of them expect 31% not to believe at all.
In France, 21% of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, compared to 33% in the United States.
Anyway, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-propelled vehicle.
After a survey by the Digital Association Bitkom, only 7% would agree to control the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway, the traffic could be 15% in the traffic of traffic, the congestion of 45 percent.
Well, each of the four would not be left to the car under any circumstances.
Boll says teamwork and double start at table tennis.
The Düsseldorf wants to compete for the title contest from 25 September to 4th of October.
The final decision is to be taken at the latest on 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The guys have experienced it in the morning."
"We are strong enough, even without Timo," said Bundestag's Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf.
At that point, Boll was on the flight to a long-term and agreed sponsor of sponsorship in China.
The 34 year old German champion is expected to be returned on Friday.
"Without Timo, the downside, we are now no longer such a clear favorite," said single European champion, Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who directs the list in Jekaterinburg, also reminded the EM of the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time, Timo was also missing, and we became the European champion."
"We should be guided by this," said the world ranking fifth.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has got a heavy injury on the right leg.
At the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was arrested by Héctor Moreno and swapped for a long time.
The first diagnosis was hinted at by the 20-year-old player of Bastian pig rider on a shin.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible.
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figure-sized cabinett: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: Mannequins, which look terrifying in character thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the main star of the fashion scene with Madonnas and used men in skirts.
"I cannot tell today that I am the Enfant terrible of Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"In the past, it was easy, now it is true," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk, From the sidewalk to the catwalk, from 18 September to the Kunsthalle of the Hypo Cultural Foundation," it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
"For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in Canadian Montreal and in Paris.
"It is so much more than beautiful dresses," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed training.
The film is not built chronologically, but it is a highly choreographed piece of work for which a lot of effort has been made: In order to devour the puppets, for example, a stylist was involved.
14 tons of material have been mapped to Munich according to details of the Kurator Thierry Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, a special highlight was: A leather pants outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men"), and for those who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Even Gaultiers old teddy can be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first and very timid steps taken by the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football), he was attracted to his teddy bear, Gaultier.
To play with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
It was then that he brought him back to himself.
He stole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers, such as Gaultier in Munich.
Later I bought it of course.
He was unable to pay the models for his first own fashion show.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plaued tip as fashion niche.
In the past it went to the long embroidery machines in and chat to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities by customers who, for example, used them to blankets and curtains.
That alone doesn't work anymore, explains Andreas Reinhardt, the Managing Director of Modesight Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
Fashion played a larger role in the early days of the while, was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt calls some examples: Lace in jewellery, for accessories such as bags, and for regional costumes.
When it comes to vintage fashion, it is an increasing demand for vintage fashion.
Anyone who does not use niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all contracts.
Together with a team of nine other companies, Moears is a member of the industry association with all the rest of the industry.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, around 80% of sales have been broken.
There are almost no more than private retailers and wholesale companies.
Our products hardly reach our customers on this road.
The bulk goods are now manufactured more cheaply in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed by chains.
Moreover, exports, now to Russia and the United States, are also weakening.
There are plenty of reasons to do so.
The industry association also tries to point to environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explained by the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have been producing a quality seal that shows that we are producing ecologically and socially acceptable products."
Reinhardt adds: "It also refers to the materials used."
Mr. Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch of the WestSaxon University of Applied Sciences Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter competition from the Asian region, you need to find high quality and innovative products.
That will take time and courage.
It creates a tension between the most imaginative ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically," says Schmidt.
That is why an existing design is often very easy to vary to keep a client base.
A few years ago, textile designer, Kati Reuter, revived the historic snowball.
It is the machine that works in a number of places.
The chat of gold in Bianca Hallebach was inspired by inspiration: "Initially, I couldn't start with a traditional plausibility."
Now it is using the snowball tip for its jewellery.
In a costly procedure, they shape the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauen," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia, and Finland - above all, to customers whose ancestors have lived in the region and who want to have a memorial to them.
In doing so, I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the get-togethers.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" film.
Legend does not touch legends, but Disney still dares a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins."
However, according to the "Entertainment Weekly" it is not a matter of refiltration, but of a kind of continuation that is playing with the magical child care 20 years after the first film.
It is the experience of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director says: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
XI urges the world to open the economy more broadly to the world.
The economy needs to open up more externally in order to encourage growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday a group tasked with steering reform.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group for deepening a comprehensive reform.
Promoting start-ups and reforms, creating new momentum and vitality, and providing new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a set of directives, including a negative list of rules on market access, relaxation of border controls, promotion of the state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and the overhaul of the resident reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is created, identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important because it assigns the market a larger role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also ease controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to do business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
As part of a bid to open state-controlled sectors, other areas of private investment will be opened up.
"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them," said the statement.
In addition, it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to practise their activities and use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also included Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
The EU aims to double mercury limits in predators
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury to large predators and allow consumers to have a much higher dosage of the nerve.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, who has a corresponding working paper of the EU, criticised the plans sharply: "Risk and side effects of miscellaneous industrial policy and environmental policy are passed on with full force for pregnant women and children," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, for 'economic policy reasons' are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
Large predators, today, are already burdened with mercury that, on the basis of the current limit values, about 50% of catches cannot be sold.
After a doubling of the limit values, only 14.5% would be unsold.
In return for this relaxation, the EU, according to the Foodwatch, wants to tighten the limit values for other fish currently from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligram mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch described this as the "trick" because smaller chants, such as carp, are usually so low that they are already meeting the targets at present.
The reason for this is that the reduction in the case of small wine was "a perfide red herring that only helps the economy."
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which is heavily enriched by the food chain, especially in predators.
As a result, the Federal Government warns that "already low quantities can cause particularly low levels of the nervous system."
The Federal Environment of the Environment declares that it is not expected to be "a health threat to the general population" on its homepage with regard to the current maximum levels.
Above all, mercury comes to the environment through the incineration of coal.
According to a written report by the Federal Environment Ministry, German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example, in the Elbe, the Rhine, and the Danube, was "permanent and widespread," the "Spiegel" cited in March from the paper.
Last year, EU-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
Foodwatch calls on consumers to protest at the EU's plans under:
