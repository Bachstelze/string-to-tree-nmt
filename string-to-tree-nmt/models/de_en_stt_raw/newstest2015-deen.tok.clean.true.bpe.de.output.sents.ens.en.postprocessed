Police of Karratha arrested 20 people after a fast motorcycle hunt.
A motorcycle was seized after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70km/h zone and bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried this morning to stop a blue motorbike after they had observed it, as it left a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver ignored the holding and continued on the Burgess Road before he turned off into the bushland, where the officials lost their eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarian.
The police of Karratha accused a 20-year-old man of failing to comply with a stop and reckless driving.
He would appear on 23 September in front of the District Court in Karratha.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.

Reverting to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish trade unions as civil law.
"As trade unions die, even the middle-class jobs die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, and Deputy Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I take pride in the civil rights law of John Lewis.
This ground-breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on account of the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops anti-union forces.
The amendment to the national law on labour law, in order to create an opportunity for discrimination against workers in the organisation of a trade union representative in order to bring justice to a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative, at least according to American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal are suggesting is the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries across the country, Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and comply with labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy, Hedki Tojos, was replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions had a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "workers" rights to unification and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight, David Eisenhower and his staff, urged Germans to write a constitution that would make fascism replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organise themselves and should speak out in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly said: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve labour and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and to each profession or profession.
Agreements that restrict or target this right are null and void; targeted measures are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which was drafted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as it was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors guaranteed that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect its interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that human rights are human rights.
When this country consulted other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to the formation of a trade union - and that this trade union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - should be protected.
Indeed, as these rights in America have been under attack, it is very wise to see the American ideal again, so that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now all of us know that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and increased the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History reminds us, and that is what we should do.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and that led to the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporarily the law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana may be forced to close down.
On Sunday, for the time being, a US federal judge stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, from the lawyer, that it would probably have led to the closure of all five of the state's abortion clinics.
This measure, which Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, was elevated to the law in June and is to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out abortions to purchase a hospital at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles.
The decision of the judge, however, means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being, while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue working in law while they seek to obtain these rights," wrote Federal judge John Degravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing will be held for the judge in order to bring about a more durable decision for the law.
Abortion welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of sentences against similar measures, and the fact that doctors had more time to gain access to hospital.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana do not escape an insidious law that seeks to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, which had complained in the name of three of the state's five hospitals to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who did not support the case and had also applied for the right of referral.
Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi as unconstitutional.
Keys to a law in Texas that would have forced most of the remaining clinics to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that intervention rights by doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion believe that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who carries out abortion in Louisiana has access to patients, sharing the centre for reproductive rights.
If all of the other doctors in the state are forced not to carry out abortions, the group would not be able to carry out the operation for fear of its security.
In their argument against the ruling, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, during which applications for patients would be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James put a video for her mother, who died in 2007 with ovarian cancer.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, who detected ovarian cancer in 2005, noting that only 25% were in life for five years after diagnosis.
The research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDIE: New drugs could slow down lung cancer and ovarian cancer.
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, existing precursors and social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
The survival rate was the lowest for older women and those whose cancer has already advanced at the time of diagnosis.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not study why women outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
In spite of the improvement of telemedicine services, in order to counter the distances, it proposed as a possible remedy to strengthen the service of doctors flown in, specialists who can provide specialists with the possibility of supplying women more closely to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, found a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and highlighted the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden of Garden regrets the fall in the number of homeowners
The decline, together with a growing decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause garden centres to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year when today's young consumers arrive at a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55% of the amount that people spend on their homes.
The rise of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular method of aspecting to asphalt for parking purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which £5 billion per year is spent on sale.
In the Greater London area, where, over a period of 6 years, the share of homeowners has fallen from 61% to 43%, the lowest costs for garden products per household are reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot pull plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for RHS, said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when they move with them."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail trade, owing to rising homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980" s to the middle of the 1990s.
For this year, he also forecast an improved market situation for the better weather after unfavorable weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the cleric Tahirul Qadri, continues in Pakistan.
In the capital, Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators have stormed the public television station PTV.
Information minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed protesters out of PTV buildings.
The transmitter placed its operation for about 40 minutes, but now broadcasts again.
At the same time, around 3,000 demonstrators tried to enter the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometre away from it, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones to create collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters called for the resignation of Sharifs, but he refuses to do so.
The country's army, meanwhile, calls for a political solution to the conflict, "without time to waste and apply without violence."
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Premier Sharif of being cheated in the parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests were escalated at the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters to invade Sharifs' residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appointed US diplomat on charges of espionage
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered a report on American and British espionage in Turkey from the country's oldest US diplomat.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the business entity of the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept showed that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a key activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all the major countries were spied on each other.
An earlier report that also targeted Germany's most important secret service, Germany, caused much angry reactions from the Turkish Government.
Warning strike: Drivers are in danger of commuters.
The nationwide warning strike of the train drivers on Monday evening could also interfere with the movement of persons in NRW.
The booth, which has been announced for 18 - 21 hours, will take place throughout Germany.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

Said the head of the union of the union of German locomotives (GDL), Sven Schcentre, in Düsseldorf.
We are counting on significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so that it would be difficult to foresee the consequences.
Police Chief of Magaluf of Corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors provided evidence for the blackmail of policemen and employees of the city of Calvià.
The head of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested for allegations of corruption by businessmen and bartenders in the notorious Binge Drinking Hotspot Magaluf.
Main Commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, has been taken into custody following corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs lie.
According to the online daily of Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors put evidence to the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Majorca on Friday for the blackmail of policemen and employees of the city of Calvià.
Two other local policemen were arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the corruption charges and are jointly consulted with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that angry nightmares were saying that the authorities had serious implications for their business.
"It is no longer a matter of making money, it is about survival," said one of the businessmen in the court.
Let us put our livelihoods out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer because of a viral YouTube video, in which a 18year-old British tourist was shown, taking care of 24 men during a coffin Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop the illegal behaviour of alcoholic tourists in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants to the infamous alcohol-related Kneipp belt tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the male case took place, was forced for a year of closure, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage together had to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73.000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British tourists, is also known for several accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of the "Balconing," where people jump from a balcony to the other or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet weather conditions and weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport.
The FRÜHLING has brought a winter surprise, with heavy spectators and strong wind, affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
At the end of the night there were a lot of rain on the town, after 6.6mm, which had already been going down on Sunday in the night.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a bus that started just before 20 and caused almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After winter took place last week for an early dose of spring, the temperature in the city on Monday fell to a peak of only 15.8 ° C.
The gusty weather has probably led to the late arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land shortly after 7.30 pm, but was hit by a joke - a sudden change in the wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to run through.
At that time, the pace of the wind reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to start with a second landing flight and finally set up at 20.40.
The flight delays led to the delay of several other flights, including a Dubai flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible spectacles.
Matthies believes it is time to go to the big net.
In view of the rapid technological progress that threatens to turn our cosy home into high-tech switchgear, Bernd Matthies is comforted by a very familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this here, I notice the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone, and I think: Boah, as retro is that?
But there is a thought behind this: If the cable weren't, all listeners would fly around in the house in a very short time, and that would be much more retro.
In any case, it is the eceltronic (ekeltronic).
No, typo: Electronic) sector is the rule that the world's newness is today the electrical waste of tomorrow is bought - outdated.
Those who, for example, still have a tube TV in the living room are simply saying that they are opposed to television as a matter of principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressure of the Ifa on the radio tower this week is once again pointing out our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
Today, the Laie, who used to control the washing machine and the CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread to him with untouchable expert spree: "connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies."
Yes, we are going to go?
What are we supposed to talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such Quark?
In fact, for some 20 years, it has been about the fact that we are supposed to connect our house.
In order for the yoghurt to be reordered, the fire alarm on the Maldives tells us that it burns in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we had from the office out of the air conditioning to our early arrival?
Yes, air conditioning is required.
But a dream will come true in the near future: We are going to lift our wristwatch, say it according to her!
Misleading.
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred," one industry of the industry, you can connect the washing machine with a headphones, the steam cooker sends the weather report and the data brides show how long the pizza is still needed in the oven, but that is not good because we are in the middle of it.
We also know from daily practice: If a new one is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed.
What is another reason for this is that the spiral cable will also survive the next radio show on the phone.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after they had spent the summer in air shelters, while missile and mortar fire on their communities collapsed during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school start brought a sense of joy and anticipation to communities in the south of Israel, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff of the "Pashosh" child garden hit by a rocket, before the arrival of the students of Granatsplitter from the walls and sliding lights.
"We have a bit of fear, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, friend at Kibbutz Saad and his English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that it feels "a bit weird" to suddenly return to school.
"These were difficult times, and we have not gone out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz close to the border with Gaza in order to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of residents of the border communities like Saad in their homes left their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer grenade, are reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education has said that a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children have been housed in other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is badly designed by the Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children, learned a lot and said "We will ensure that their knowledge becomes acquired and gives you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an open-ended ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire has provided for an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for the abolition of the Israel-Egyptian blockade in Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel is calling for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them were killed, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the displaced persons are fighters, but they did not provide concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza region, and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were rebuilt into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective spaces and the fighting continues, the education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be open so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amaro, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza.
After election in Saxony: CDU Vice-Strobl calls into question NPD
In view of the loss of votes by the NPD in Saxony, the CDU Federal vize Thomas Strobl has spoken in favour of an end to the current NPD prohibition procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU Federal vize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should be brought to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD performs worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU's head in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung."
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that leads me to conclude that the NPD are fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
During the vote on Sunday, the NPD had failed very much at the 5% threshold.
A first attempt at a ban on the far-right party had failed in 2003 because constitutional protection had also had informants in the NPD.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag were not united.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
On the newcomer, refugees are now placed in tents.
The primary recording for refugees in Harburg burst from all seams.
Now the interior authority has set out three tents of the Red Cross.
District leaders were informed in the first place - they were little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to raise concerns among the citizens and give regional politicians no possibility of participating constructively in the humane housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, group leader of the Greens at the Harburger County Assembly.
Their party demands that the district administration of Harburg currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overcrowding in the initial recording are the onslaught of help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in the following facilities.
Many refugees remain, therefore, for longer than the regular three months.
Home prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in Australia's capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data of Monday.
With this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2%, the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price increases were 10.9%, more than double the rate of the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne drive a two-tier market.
The figures from RP Data show that home prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, compared to 11.7% in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where prices rose on average by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale there is Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lawless said that with the start of the spring, there would be an increase in real estate for the next few months, which would put the market in a real test.
"When we look at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast rate of sales and the constantly low interest-rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion on the New Press, he contradicts statements by the Managing Director Peer Medau and attested to this "as a Feldherr."
The style of the university is not, that is, in the communication.
The Medau family had already been informed about the idea of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only known in July are definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he refers to the fact that the plans are not about 'prefixes or even decisions', although it would be "preferences."
Even the development of the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than that feared by the Medals.
Of a nine-metre long road, it was and is not mentioned.
The current situation is around 5,50 meters, which is a metre wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and owed parking space will only be used by university students in the future is something that Pötzl does not want to apply.
It's not at all because this can be solved intelligently by other public parking spaces.
Thinking about people living in the vicinity
The children's crib, which is located on the site and would lead to the entrance to the parking deck, is said not to be affected by the university president.
Rather, he admits that this is not only about the crib of the child, but also about the inhabitants of the entrance to the Friedrich-Streib street and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring Realschule.
It is therefore a question of much more than the special interests of Mr Medau.
Whether the critique of the parental authority of the child's crib, with the development of the road would be allowed to be "the few natural spots of Coburgs," "the reader can decide for himself."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl wants to inform the city councils of the development of the university by 2020 and, in this context, address the importance of the new development.
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the kindergarten about the school's plans last week.
This means that access to the new parking deck should not take place via the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but through the Medau Mountain.
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometer.
According to the projections of the Medals, traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would be tenfold.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles a day.
The city did not want to speak about the project.
Glandorf comes from a team of handball.
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from SG Flensburg, Germany has raised health problems for this decision.
The decision has not been easy for me; it has been matured for several months.
It is for me time to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," said the 2007 World Champion on his Facebook page.
In this way, he is going to take stock of 167 country games and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement.
He is now no longer available to the new Bundestag, Dagur Sigurdsson, because it is going to want to go to Torejagd for a few years for the Champions League winner from Flensburg.
With the Icelanders who announced on Tuesday that the country matches against Switzerland, Glandorf has had a long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as they will inspire my long-time fellow players and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be healthy over the next few years.
The left-handed had to fear his career in 2012 following a ferrata infection.
Because of Achilles" problems he had been treated by team doctors of the Deutsche Handballbundes (DHB) with a cortician injection, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, and the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional life and eleven years of national career do not pass by body.
I have some health sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infectious foot operations, which were carried out in short time in 2012, I have never managed to get to grips with my blood pressure.
In this respect, there are a number of other veiled complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I realized that I can control my head, but my body cannot be deceived," explained Glandorf in the interview of the magazine "Handball Time."
For a comeback, it would only be available in absolute emergency.
"If all stripes tear, I am always ready to talk," explained the two-fold family father of the trade magazine.
However, I can count on the years in which I can still play handball.
I must also say that, following my long stay in hospital in 2012, I have also become rather humble when it comes to my health.
After my career I would like to go at least to some extent.
In addition to the World Cup of 2007 and the win of the Champions League 2014, he took the EHF cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup with Flensburg.
Germany's Economy of 0.2% in the Spring
The crises around the world have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2% from April to the end of June 2014.
This was shared by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade, too, has slowed the economy.
For the first half of the year, a GDP increase of 0.8% over the second half of 2013 would be a 0.8% increase for the first half of the year.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the Münsterland Mooiste, which led to the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar on Sunday experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzencher."
The biggest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, hosted the so-called Münsterlands-Mooiste.
This is one of the biggest cycling routes across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked us for organizing this trip through the Münsterland.
This tour has been offered to interested parties in various professional journals.
We come from Den Helder and are overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland also in this way," the cyclists were delighted about the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration at the club of the Schützenborn Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city on the wall, where the start took place.
The route continued in the direction of Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld, via Havixbeck and Billerbeck to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres with 1475 metres altitude and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were cared for on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
One of the highlights of this cycling event was the success of this cycling event.
We are happy and it was a nice experience for all concerned.
The organization ran without problems and there were no adverse events," Heinz Lölfing drew a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizers who had hoped, which was probably the result of bad weather forecasts and of the morning rain.
"We are going to see nice weather on 30 August or during another weekend in 2015," the cyclist promised to return to the Münsterland.
This is the first time that he has been accused of being accused of committing suicide.
It is in fact more philosophical testimony than Biography, which Konstantin Wecker, Liedermacher, pacifist, politbe activist, ex-prisoner, has put on paper in 287 pages in "monk and warrior."
On 1 June 1947, his memoirs, which were written by Munich on 1 June 1947, were written by his memoirs, each of which was initiated by a piece of lyrics.
And he is ruthless: From the Onanie, as a high school up to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also takes abstract, but the more important terms are one: Love, soul, ego, the being in the now, spirituality - all that he tries to go on the ground, on a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and the way in which he has influenced not only the music (opera lovers became a soul and rock musician), but also his imprisonment.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the asketic monk, who is "through subtraction," as he says, "by leaving everything away."
There are also brief anecdotes on earth between all of the highly spiritual views: For example, over temples in one of GIs or a crazy car ride in which he heads up a tree.
Here, too, he is ruthless.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me to the arm.
Has never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was, worked in a factory and its relationship was limited.
Henry rehearsed for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, who was partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with vivid melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, but he only heard his voice: "Listen to the collar.
Let your sister be quiet.
Go ahead!
I want to look at cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub and talked about things, such as the form of beer, or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life he was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It is now slightly brighter, but they are dark, rough, deep stylized labyrinths with flame wounds and smoke and soot.
My father used to put it into the tub and then he could slowly hear how he started to sing because he could wash the foundry.
When I went there, it became clear to me that he had done that for years to bring food on the table and my respect for him was greater.
However, Henry, as a child, grew up without love of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went badly at the end of her life, we began to say "I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love that he had missing as a child.
Could you stop saying "I love you?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still a friend of French with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys's own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to their death.
So when I became very, very overweight and symptoms of diabetes showed, my doctor said "you need to be radical.
So I pulled this fitness through and had to make a drastic diet in order to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henrys's career change is perhaps reflected in his elegant, short-cut bar.
Ever since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he was captured by the theatre.
It followed The comedy of errors, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled its busy working life.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was for a rather long time the only black imitation on television."
He learned in the profession.
I had to learn not only from the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient Witze story machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 in New Faces
As his manager had the stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people of "black to old" were performing, Henry introduced his comedy there for five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I somehow wish that it never happened, but I do not regret that I did it.
It was a curious, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a big audience.
But this "year-long award-winning easy pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
In the 1980s, by introducing figures that were celebrating British black culture, Henry worked in an alternative comic circuit in the 1980s.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie boss.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles were predominated for the next decade, but according to his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What do you do next, because everything feels like it is just the time you have a little on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was very allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never learned anything about him in school and mostly held it for a domain of the middle class, white in pantyhose and a cabbage head.
So I was very afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Don't do it badly if you don't know what you are talking about.
Take a few of the words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare so much.
Henry made 20 lines out of Othellos's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put the head on his head.
"That is what we are talking about, it is a serious matter, you take your text seriously, you can read your text.
The samples were brutal, and I read it for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car crash, and that simply did not happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed you."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me "You have to bridge 10 minutes now while repairing the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God."
I am not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stick in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre.
The text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
That was also good, so it is like a big sign of the gods who tell me that "this is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a given voice.
So I stand by it.
I really love that.
I love to be in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of stranger is somehow dangerous.
If you look for it forever, you are going on a wall.
I sometimes go live in the Apollo if I want to do so, but overall I don't have as much as I did before.
I wonder if he will make a stand-up Comedytour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning, a middle section and the end of a journey - I do not think I want to give up.
Is this the new incarnation of India?
I think so.
I am happy to be an actor.
It is fun.
A story is always being told, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels blocking roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis have been called into civil disobedience in the capital, Sanaa.
Huthi supporters would have occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Huthi Party "Ansar Allah."
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report about a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had been called on to take action on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened to threaten the conflict with a further escalation of the conflict, if its demands were not met.
The Shiite Huthis are fighting for more independence from the Sunni-led Yemen and are demanding the resignation of the government.
The tribe of the Huthi has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the main access routes to Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya Registered civil servants to reduce "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to register all public officials with biometrics to delete "ghost workers" from the government's pay lists.
Employees who do not register for the next two weeks would not pay more, a government notice sent.
The government suspects that thousands of people are still receiving salary payments even after they have left the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised corruption in the civil service when he took office in 2013.
In a review at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700,000) per month was lost to payments for "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that wages continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear in the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data are received via biometric registrations, has been reported in a government message.
Anyone who did not do so without credible apology from the payroll continued the communication.
"By doing so, it will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service, by identifying the actual number of officials and clearing up the payroll at both levels of government," said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of Defense in the Ministry of decentralisation and planning.
The scandal of the art adviser Helge Achenbach will be in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are calling for damages of Achenbach and two of his companies involved in insolvency proceedings.
This was shared by a lawyer on Monday.
In the box it is said that Achenbach had cheated the purchase of works of art and vintage cars, and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher prices for purchases that were actually paid.
As a result, the commission that was agreed would have been higher.
For 121 million Euros, Achenbach purchased valuables for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school for 44 years, 23 as head of the school.
From that time, Manfred Richter knows many of Petershausener's and Kollbacher's times as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but were always inspired by his desire to see people in the student.
The Schneekoppe is the best known mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif of his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau / North Bohemia, now Trutnov.
After four years of secondary school, he was interested in the teacher's profession.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their homes.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagons.
That is how judges in the north-west of Germany are getting rid of.
The teaching of teachers took place in Bamberg.
To this end, Manfred Richter had to take ten kilometres per week to the nearest railway station, drive by train to Bamberg, go there three kilometres across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping opportunity in a red-cross home in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951, after three years of apprenticeship, he made the second state examen.
Since Oberfranken had not taught him a free teacher, he went to Upper Bavaria and joined the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Miss room" was his first "apartment" in the school.
In 1958, in addition to the school, he moved into a three-room apartment.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, in Kollbach, there were three classes and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 196/69, they were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only primary school remained in the area.
In order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school, the then rector changed Georg Sigl to Karlsruhe - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and in September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to refer to today's building, which was extended to Judge retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had been building a workshop on municipal costs in addition to a work space and the extension of a cellar in 1997, although this was not eligible for support in accordance with the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," recalled judges.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a representative who replied to a lecture by a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love."
"You have to give children two things: Roots and wings," says the age of 84.
And he had to learn that "this will not always succeed."
In any case, judge was sometimes unconventional.
When pupils were tested, they did not receive any kind of criminal work and were not sent back.
At the expense of the congregation, Judge had created two pairs of boxing gloves and allowed the two parties to compete against each other, even if there should be a bullet.
For the benefit of the school, judge, as a rector, had a good relationship with the then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
He moved the non-partisan judge after retirement, at least in 1996, at least as the last on the CSU list for the local council.
But judges were elected in place and joined the CSU.
180 Kilometers in Three Days
Hr4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists put a stop in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten.
When cyclists go on tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast, this is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of stopping impressions was made: The 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the free sky in the gravel Alteburgpark.
On Thursday the participants met in Bad Vilbel and experienced a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was taken seriously: The cyclists took the first stage, the 60 km from Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of the Mayor Hans-Peter seum, who was started in Bad Vilbel with the bicycle, and the head office of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring, were welcomed.
For refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: The landlady from Ranstadt and Nieder had 85 sheets of apple, Zwinger, and cheese cake.
"Such cakes can only bake country wives," a participant from Aulendiebach praised, while he changed another bit.
Cold refreshments could be enjoyed at the drinks booth of the sports club of Geiß-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" stopped visitors with familiar melodies from operettas and musicals.
The hotel is located in the heart of the city.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage of his partner: "He has earned him, finally he has already fixed a chain of bicycle chains again today."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: They were interviewed at the fountain in front of reporter Rainer Janke's tip and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Since the first hr4 cycling tour in 2004, Tobias Hagen has also been able to do a bit of snow, since he had to do a lot of equipment on the ground.
His Pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and a radio device with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle stunt of the police in Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even many cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends on the accommodation capacities available.
In Category I will be accommodated in hotels, in category II in class accommodation.
From the spa resort the cyclists had a good impression when they stopped again after an hour and a half.
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!
After the arrival in Scots, the group could take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were called in idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the gravel company for tourism and city marketing (GTS), the park had a nice festive atmosphere and of course you could have prepared treats, such as flame cakes with well chilled spring white.
Mr. Susanne Schaab, GTS CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors in his function as a member of the board of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen.
The Three were visibly pleased with the "many businesses in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to ski in the open air has been eagerly used in spite of sporting activities on the bike.
Among the guests, there were increasing numbers of citizens, who were also taken by the good spirits, such as the great schar of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations of Birstein, the Guardian of Guardians and Bad Orb were on the agenda for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on the basis of the suspicion of the "conspiracy against the government."
The police authorities made no immediate comment.
Among the arrest of 14 senior police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they were supposed to have established organized criminal organisation and tapped telephone numbers.
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) described her approach as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric's emulsion against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school.
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he informed journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in any school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere in Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian national front must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, school head of the school in Slavjansk who visited Jazenjuks's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that children will be given an education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud retirement from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And it has its own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consultancy Bain and Co., which she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the first post of parent company Pearson went to a younger male colleague.
Her compensation was supposedly nearly £1 million.
Their political ranking is also sound.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, for more private knowledge in Whitehall: She became adviser of the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory of the Council.
Already in May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: The first guard of the first guard in the BBC, but also the voice of public alarm and alarm, is wrong when things are going wrong.
This provides for an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires a complete reform.
But whatever new president would risk, it would risk going to everything and dismounting an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he himself may be doing his job.
It is a difficult task.
And, as if that weren't enough, there are also many who are interested in seeing the BBC fall out - power, money, and status.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of the licence fees for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of €145.50 per year, the British public is buying the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: It says that it reaches 96% of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And it seems that the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53% support them today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits of the BBC have changed: I get news reports on my mobile phone today and see them later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and considerable institution.
It needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she has found it.
Perry of Texas says that lowered tweet was not authorized.
A tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, contained a belated comment about the Democratic Party Prosecutor, who is at the heart of a criminal prosecution against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perrys's user account.
Just a tweet was sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and I have deleted it," said the later news.
Perry staff did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perrys's official account went out, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavorable picture of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, which was condemned in April 2013 for drunkenness, was drawn.
Perry put a veto on a financial support for her office when she refused to step down, which led to a charge against Perry - who might be a candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet is: "I am not always drunk with the triple permitted alcohol level... but when I do it, I put it to Governor Perry when he deletes it."
I am the most hated democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the study of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His top class team of legal counsel asked for the law that was used against the oldest governor in the history of the State of Texas, arguing that the law that took place against the oldest governor in the history of the State of Texas is vague.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state money to the state's public integrity unit - located in Travis County and determined in the case of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint on the part of a left Watchdog group.
Perrys's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After graduating from Iowa during the Iowa elections in 2012, Perry suggested that he would stop by sending a tweet of a photograph of himself at a lake near a lake, with the words "South Carolina!"
Berkeley explains the housing market again for "normal."
One of the most prominent building contractors in London pointed out that the housing market returned to normal levels in the south-east of England.
Homes in the capital were hotter and subject to huge price increases, which the Bank of England, owing to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, led to set limits on mortgage lending in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and CEO of the high-class building company (Berkeley) said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013."
The property market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the registry office, the prices in the urban area alone rose by 18.5% last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales price of private, low-cost and student offers in terms of money rose by about a fifth of last year and was £423,000 at the end of April.
But a stronger pound has made property in London less attractive for foreign buyers in recent months, as some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a possible "home tax" in the run-up to the general elections in May.
The London Real Estate Agent warned last week that in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April, which introduced more stringent lending rules, would result in lower market growth in both property sales and prices.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage credit in July, which also indicates that the housing market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another property agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in housing prices in London in 2015 to 3%, on the basis of an already weakening domestic price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by one quarter to a quarter of the year, in the case of the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due to appointments amount to more than $2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and, as a result, sales of appointments remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased by 40% to €280 million per year, generating revenues of 18 percent to €1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley would be likely to meet current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts unanimously value the annual pre-tax result to 450 million pounds.
Berkeley shares were still £23.96 in London in the afternoon.
Naked pics of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet.
Jennifer Lawrence appeared at the 85th Oscarlet.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence's Oscaraward have been published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and blamed the hackers for "flagrant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
In addition to this, some of the most popular games in the world have been reported to have been posted on the website.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are genuine, although Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at the photos that my husband and I recorded years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the nickel metal series "iCarly" and "dead" denied that the photos were pictures of her and tweetete "These so-called nude pictures of me are fake, people.
Let's take a look at the beginning of the game.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop stars Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photographs of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed novel about love and the letter J.
They were crushed, so it was best to describe them, and they were slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
From time to time a woman said that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, more distant.
And then he shook his hand.
He knew how to scratch.
He was stubborn, as in Igel.
The last victim of this bliss was an incipient affair that had been more promising to alleviate the lonely boredom of his life, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling beauty with unspeakable hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even remote and rough as Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older escort, who had inherited a land in a moist but idyllic valley, with the true name of Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The tubes were leck, in the baths there were still spiders, neck snaps had left their mark on all windows and they believed that they belonged to them, and the garden was watched by weeds, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house out of a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had enjoyed an unusually hot spring afternoon with Ailinn, enjoying an unusually warm spring afternoon, which gave the country soothing music and soothing news, as the sight of its crossed brown legs that reminded him of an old song by a long forgotten black entertainer who had been listening to his father with closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
It was not forbidden - nothing was properly prohibited - simply did not play.
It has been successfully rendered obsolete, as the word becomes obsolete.
The general taste of what would never have done would have been, and like the people on books they chose to choose from the hang-case for millionaire memoir, cookery books and love novels, so they chose ballads for the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano, singing in a coarse comic Serenade.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"It was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That had always done his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J, it costs you a penny.
It was not a fun game at that time and it was not very funny now.
He knew that was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard which one.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not banned directly.
The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable.
It was only place for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
So is the mind.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically pushed mind.
Although he had been ten years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection.
But at least he didn't have to declare Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
In her age, she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of group talent - with gratitude to those of fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports, in other words.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed as by nature with electronic talent and were served with the task to ensure that no family remained without a working service.
What was still left of the Polish community was taken care of by the sewers, which was crushed by the Greeks.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had not left the country quickly that had been accused of being accused of being accused of fire, out of fear of being indicted for fire, in fear of the flames that they would eat next, had opened them up for the next two - had been given labels and shisha pipes
Each according to his skills.
As she only heard ballads, Ailinn was hard to understand, as the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could ever be demonized.
Music was an expression of love.
"These are not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father has never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the giant cohesive leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why should your father have loved this?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in her presence.
She already thought that he was rather curious.
"It seemed funny for him," he said instead.
She shook her head and locked the blind eye.
There was nothing to be seen around the world, as their undisguised rabbits.
There was nothing he would otherwise want to see.
"If you say it," I don't believe it.
But that does not explain why you want me to do so.
It seemed to be honest.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet do not do so directly.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
You hate?
Of course, I don't hate you.
After all, that is the stupid song.
He could have said 'I love you', but it was too early to do so.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you do," he tried instead.
I am a little perverse here.
That was wrong.
It had to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the calming charm that was needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be kevern that is.
In spite of his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from their deckchair, threw the console and swallowed up the wine that they were drinking.
The wine of wood, therefore, was no excuse for him.
In her excitation, she seemed to tremble, as Palmwedel did in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I felt pervert to you," she said,...
Except that I am not.
She was sorry, both because of the uneasiness of his words and of the fear that she showed in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did they think that he would beat them?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was in essence as it was here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke here as it was there on the shore.
The same confusing men, with even thicker skin and driething after THE WHOLE WAR that had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from Kneipe to Kneipe, always prepared to raise the hand against a woman who refused to speak or lost them.
Dickens?
They would have shown a thick fist if they didn't fit!
You've only crunched - Knutschen was the most common word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a antidote to the fugitives of love ballads from the console - they kneaded and then beat.
According to Kepler's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, because the crackling itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through his body.
He arose out of a deck chair like an old man.
She also felt pale, but the usury of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They were hard to know.
She saw him as he departed - as he saw from a room on the upper floor - a man complaining about what he had conjured up.
Adam leaves the garden, thought it.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, succumbing to his back, ashamed, defeated without fighting spirit - why was it a sight that she seemed to know well when she could not remember a single time she had already seen it before today?
When she was alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at their feet.
Several years before the events that have just been recorded, ESME Nussbaum, a smart and enthusiastic young researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for the public mood, in a short lecture on continued violence at the low and intermediate level in the areas where their reduction, if not abolished, would have been most likely to be expected, given the money and energy invested in eradicating this violence
"It has already done a lot, and much remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness was rarely felt in spite of the high resolution of the hedges.
But some properties turn out to be unpalatable.
The higher the tower, the less the passion that it continues to inspire.
The population is crying out for listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicating stories about the excesses of the past and claiming to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but it is not only the history of rural communities as well as our urban fabric, but also evidence of the emergence of a new and insightful dispute at home, in the workplace, on the streets and even in the game fields
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor, when he read the whole report.
I suggest that you read fewer novels.
ESME Nussbaum cut her head.
I must also ask: Are you an atheist?
"I think I do not have to say that," answered ESME Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, ESME invoked its right to privacy and denial.
Feminist?
Silence.
"I don't ask this," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, reading and feminism.
This is a job that is unprejudiced.
We are in favour of an unprejudiced society.
However, certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely acceptable and commendable can sometimes distort results that you have presented.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things, which you refer to as "insidious" and "roh," could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a sense of strength and vitality.
If you continue to go on what is going on, WHAT IS IT IS, if it were, if it had happened, would be to take its essential power of life to the country.
ESME Nussbaum looked at, while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED label in Flingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter-century or more.
Smile your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballet, listen to musicals, use your phone, talk to you, tell you, listen to you, listen to you, you agree, you'll be sorry.
Speaking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to do," the ESME Nussbaum answered, with a quiet voice when she was sure that her previous one had spoken, "and I say nothing other than that we are not yet as effective as we are deceiving ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in a situation where we are repeating the mistakes that have actually led to THE BUSINESS that has been used for that purpose.
This time, however, it is not the others in which we leave our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with hands.
To indicate the patient of an angel.
"They go too far," he said, "if you refer to actions as "errors" that our grandparents may or may not have made.
They also go too far when you say that they have left out their "anger" and "distrust" to "others."
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past, as in the case of the protection of the present, we are not talking about "us" and "others."
There was no "us" and there was no "other."
It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.
"If we are honest with ourselves," ESME dared to accuse, "No part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I am not sticking to anyone.
Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened, has happened.
That was the case at that time.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we agree on that.
Just as no blame has to be apportioned, it is not necessary to blame it, if such repayment would be appropriate and if there were a way to wipe it out.
But what does the past to do if we do not learn from it?
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I may say something about this
Luther Rabinowitz brought together his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," said he and her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorcyclist who, as passers described, was in a kind of "brutal anger" on the footpath.
There are coincidences.
Lesotho says that no coup d'état is planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho were arguing that a coup d'état was planned to overthrow the government and say that they were opposed to policemen accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the army of the country was surrounded by its headquarters and government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after reporting threats of assassination.
Military spokesperson Major Ntoi said that there is de facto no coup d'état that, however, the military is reacting to the threat of "political fanatics," whose armed forces are in the hands of the police.
"What happened this morning was that the Guard of the Defense Forces of Lesotho acted after he had received several intelligence reports that, within the police, some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc," he said to Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that military action gave the impression of a crash.
"Although no one has claimed that the government has seized power by force, all the reports agree that the activities of the Defence Forces of Lesotho have so far shown signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Speakers of the military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers would sit back in their barracks and be calm in the capital.
In the meantime, the vice-premier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the governance during Thabane absence.
Thabane said that he believes that he has become a target for his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, since June, there has been a great deal of tension after Thabane has suspended parliamentary meetings because of the arguments in its unity government.
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government, despite accusations.
Production in the Eurozone on a 13-month Tief
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point of the last 13 months, according to a study that was closely monitored.
The final market value index of manufacturing (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a booth of 51.8 in July.
A list of 50 indicates expansion.
New orders went back, and factories experienced collapses in a time of rising tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will take place before the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect a clear plan from the Bank for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and for the threat of deflation in an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the ECB's head, Mario Draghi, could provide further information later this week whether he would consider quantitative easing for the eurozone, in line with those made by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although a little growth is better than zero growth, the slowing effects of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, leading economist in markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a sorcerer, as well as Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications that growth in growth in the key industrial mechanism in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are no longer effective are also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say about the purchasing management index in the eurozone in August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone are obviously rather difficult at present, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - are widening in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and it is likely that some contracts will be delayed or even cancelled, in particular large contracts.
He said that it would be "more and more likely" that the ECB eventually needed to launch a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The survivors of the survivors of Beslan have passed away: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children involved in it are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people from Chechen militias were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day Martyrium that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united East and East in abhorrence, and surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell is going to follow them forever.
Their greatest hope?
The war that Ukraine is now searching for - and in the child that it kills - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed during an attempt to climb up the crushed school sports hall.
She was photographed and known by the Russian star, Dimitri Beliakov, when she only tried to use her underwear to climb into the crushed school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused by her mother, Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
Both were held dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me that I should run for my life, but I could not," said Aida.
My legs were bloodless.
I stood up and climbed again to search for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a number of operations, she considered herself completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I am afraid that I have to go again.
Some shells are still in my knees.
Your goal is to become a dentist in order to help the people, as was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it has not broken me," she says.
"That happened to me, and you cannot change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who have stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think later of a family.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, although the memory of each year becomes a little weaker.
I am glad that many people in the world are still reminded of our horrors, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see online the photo of me, as I read into the school back, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help to ensure that this does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball thought that his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (Russians went to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year, he said: "Mama told me that I should sit down when there is an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion he thought she would die.
She said to him: 'Run'.
Afraid that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying baby on his way.
His father, Vladimir, who joined his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said: 'I could not save them'.
In fact, Tamara was outside, with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn in the assumption that her son had died.
After reunification she said: "I was crying for joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now unresolved newspaper News of the World) in order to get the title of a barns's Children's Champion from the then Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop the remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will be cloudy in my memory.
I know that I threw away all my toy guns directly after that.
But now I can play games with a shot and this is not a problem for me.
"I have no fear of going back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those children whom I played in the courtyard and who did not make it outside.
We never say that they were killed or dead.
We say that they have remained in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially at the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted and drive in an open car.
But now he is afraid of the place of Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me of it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from greyhounds," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I would like to help.
I will one day go to the police and I hope that they will take me next year at the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, you can imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could cry out and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers vividly her journey to London with Damir.
The people of London cried when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her yourself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borchsch and how she called all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant.
And that was just a month after horror.
I was surprised that the British so readily shared our pain and supported us.
She said: 'I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just such children as ours.
I think that for many of the war is a part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I cannot stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the last abominations.
I know that he does not like to be reminded of it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go into the sports hall and the light of the candles.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes turned on the sofa, the face of us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he was going to continue all his weapons and other military toys.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for some hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion, I looked around and saw the hell around me, with body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell was unable to survive.
"I remember that I was running him, "Damir, running, run away," but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he has gone away.
And that is how life goes, unlike many others for us.
Mr Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of the atrocities of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan survivors of Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima, after the siege of 2004, on the right of Georgij today.
His bloodstained face was marked by fear of running his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had deposed him for his first day of school before she rushed to bring her older son to university.
"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgian managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the more difficult it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it is long ago, I think it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days are following me forever.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Strong: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school this day; he said that he wanted to kill his teacher.
I knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the wine-making Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: 'It is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People always investigate such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they are investigating the fall of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Are we ever going to know what caused him?
This world is becoming something of a horror.
"I cannot understand how that is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war.
Ten years are nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a couple of nightmares because of the siege, but then it became better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and were afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That is why I am always going to the sports hall when 1 September approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old children.
It is difficult for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I do not feel myself as a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not try.
My life continues.
I completed the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I will become heart surgery.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgiy Faniev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
A miracle: Georgiy Fanyev was caught during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was caught in the sports hall and was sitting next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel it was as if it would have been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret agent, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, it is nothing I have left behind me.
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say that this is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt I was actually a little better, but I cannot forget it.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - in the year afterwards - this was the first and only time that I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous image.
Survivor: Georgiy Faniev today, with a photo of herself in hospital after the siege on the laptop.
My pain is incredible and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I don't like to think about or speak about it, and they never asked me about the school.
Physically I feel good.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can now walk well.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's secret service academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I have sent my documents, I have also sent them in medical cases and they have replied that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been behind me for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this and they should not, of course, suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse, when the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the ceremonies to commemorate.
I know that Georgiy will not go.
It must be much more intense for him because he was there and I was not.
I waited at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that if there is something so unfair.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he cannot take part because of his knee.
He has been operated on several occasions, he can run, but he cannot do sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror at 50%, but we can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege, and this only increased my pain.
I have lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart wept around the thieves.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who have never married.
It is difficult to accept that life will continue, even if you do not want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I cannot believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are being killed.
If we could only attack and go beyond all these rebels - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, which was so moved by a special command in safety, was worn in safety.
Baton: Aljona Tskajewa is placed in security by a Russian Special Command Command (left).
It is now ten (right) and it does not recall the atrocities at all.
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was born in the poor of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but they held back in their cruelty to their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister of Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, who was three years old, escaped, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has been married again since then and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana that he named after his lost daughter, Kristina.
Aljona, who is ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into a smart and happy girl, neighbors.
"You are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and will spare them all the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused girls of crossing pedestrian crossings in Fife.
A 78-year-old man is on a pedestrian walkway in Fife because of the overtaking of a three-year girl.
Gordon Steward is accused of having driven a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charge was made, Mr Steward took his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charge to the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC launched the case for January.
4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos.
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a choice of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point and shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are for about $300.
I have recorded these photos in a family party with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are close.
Also place your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
A number of cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the underwater conditions that are underwater.
And before you jump, check out what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the reviews of digital cameras for conventional and watertight models.
Make multiple shots - because many will not fold.
Point and shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So take a lot of pictures.
If your camera has a row mode that makes a series of shots with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse the further you remove itself from the surface.
If possible, you will remain close to the surface if you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice to the country, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light.
It is particularly important for you to work with an action cam: These devices often have a strong wide-angle lens, which means that you have to take a closer look at your objects when they need to fill out the entire image wiring.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an advisory, he dedicated his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the anguish of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers a MI6 staff who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to the diagnoses and diseases, while the treated are predominantly employed with something quite different: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose suffering began.
"I did not feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulty getting me up.
While fighting with the flu symptoms, he noted that he made a impatient reproach to his wife.
"I want everything as soon as possible," he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusually disturbing.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an x-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he was skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray inspection was there.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, that is the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancers have been smokers in the past.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber that once was considered to be fatal.
For most of us, Mesothelioma is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s, when industry voluntarily undertook to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries were working directly with the substance - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers.
As an industrial hazardous material from another time, it hardly seems to be worrying today.
But that complacency is misguided.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the culmination of a Mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from Mesothelioma than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.
Annual numbers of mesotheliomial cases since 1980 and prospective future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are now experiencing the deadly effects, despite the fact that asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999, all types of asbestos were banned), is that a mesothelioma is developing only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not confined to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and still is often, in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And that is why Mesotheliom knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no shelter.
The buildings in Parliament are contaminated by asbestos.
The hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy have already been identified as the source of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber either.
It was indeed difficult to imagine where he might have been in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years on my education," wrote he.
All - students, nurses, doctors and carers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many people will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question in part.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who suffered from mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I'm the last one who still lives."
How many of us will fall ill?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty per cent of all mesothelioma patients die within eight months of the diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many will fall ill?
Britain's leading expert, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that, between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to come to a standstill, a total of 90,000 of the disease will fall.
Most of them do not yet know that they are going to die.

A quick look at the files of the courts, to which the people concerned often object to claims for compensation, shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioms is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted that they were exposed to asbestos by Janice Allen.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her work at M & S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I did not really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestos form," a description of the fibre structure, which makes the fabric resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof tiles, floor tiles, pipe isolations, boilers and even brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is nevertheless seen by the EU and the WHO as a "great risk of health."
However, the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain used to be the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts assume that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was one of the main reasons for the uniquely high mesotheliomrats'.
An employee at Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy in the flagship store at Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not have been seen as a typical mesothial victim, but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their history is not unusual.
It has produced a study by those affected, which states that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without a known suspension was caused by work or in the home, presumably through asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks as if no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance even in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service powers and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be raised by something as harmless as "heavy air movements".
Members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is the case.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Employment Service insisted that the Western Minster Palace had received a "clean health certificate," it is now undisputed that 1 billion pounds have to be paid over several years in order to renovate Parliament to modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and after the general elections in 2015, Members would prefer to meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green benches at Westminster
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
Everything that can be done is waiting.
A person who has never been able to determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital where asbestos actions have been positively decided," he says, 'but I cannot prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where you worked and the data.
What he has yet to remember is the day at the beginning of December 2009, in which he got a kind of fever.
He was 45, and an operation took place late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came very suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I believed that it would no longer be possible to make the journey home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the breast, the skin, was stirring around his lungs.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He did not go to work one month.
Young doctors made X-rays of his breast and placed Pleurakathether in order to take the liquid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health was improving slowly and he returned to his job.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after physical activity and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient came with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not link this with his own case.
After all, his patient was older for several decades and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray images to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time, a probe fitted with a camera was introduced into the cave between the ripper and the breast.
I am an optimist.
I usually go on," he says.
To be honest, I did not have so many concerns.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "You told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
First of all, he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now contracting.
Mesothelioma is now hitting younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos solids in hospitals were under the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many people who changed pedestrians from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely to get in contact with toxic substances.
It is apparent that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving but life-threatening for the doctors who are treating them.
It is still being removed today.
Students turned their bags onto asbestos mats.
And it is not just a matter of hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties.
Also schools.
In fact, many people have had first contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemicals, students have turned their buns onto asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently mentioned on websites.
In the meantime, so innocent items have been included in our houses, such as floor tiles or scales with the use of asbestos.
"It is an industrialist that is included in large parts of our properties," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to a woman concerned was the demolition of a horseshoe in the 1970s.
So you can adjust how you tear your garden plot.
The effects of diagnosis and knowledge that the disease is incurable is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I will not experience another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how he was overwhelmed by all the information he had to cope with.
"It was very difficult to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long I have yet?"
And there were about 12 months to go.
I remember that I thought, "Na yes I will not experience another Christmas.
That is what it was."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most of the cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is raised and the fibres are inhaled, they can settle in the breast, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is caused by the inhale asbestos fibres that are inhaled," says Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac thorax doctor who changed to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital from which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has been exposed to asbestos, ironically, is a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were also likely to have been exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says that they are pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From the very beginning it is invasiv.
The usual options for other cancers do not work well with Mesotheliom.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is highly controversial.
Some say that it is worth trying.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut the breast," he says.
They do not get around with the knife.
Meanwhile, cancer "on chemotherapy" doesn't speak very well, but doesn't heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But, in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients are actually living for a long time, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a member of the community for four years after his diagnosis.
"Hi, cancer is central," he made himself happy with call.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would take four months and are expected to be extended by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson managed to make things appear in a slightly more positive light.
Following the advice of several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, the heart of the guy's thorax.
"We had an advantage by not having to be passed on, I simply called and got a date," Graham said.
A normal patient would have to receive a bank transfer and wait for approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial to mesotheliom sufferers in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But when these treatments eventually fail, many people are affected by another financial worry - about the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very small burden was also a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually placed their case, but it was not what Morgan called "full compensation."
After the investigation into his death, a spokesman of Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar were removed in the 1990" s.
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesotheliom sufferers, who are seeking compensation, who have a huge problem to be associated with a company or a job - usually for decades.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there has been clear new legislation in this year that makes it easier for Mesothelioma to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer able to find them.
The law has set up a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for all who were diagnosed after July 2012, were able to prove a contact, but were unable to sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiff receives 80% of what a court could have received in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 £.
About 300 successful applications for the programme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many Mesotheliom, thinks that 350 million £were a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and it indicates that this is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time was not passed away and Mesotheliom sufferers found the company and could sue them normally.
Mike Penning, Minister of Labour, also admitted that the law was not perfect.
But both Pening and Morgan said that rapid action is needed every day in the face of seven death victims.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Law in December of last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple-therapy with which Lang Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is, of course, the most important thing," says Abbott.
This is always the case with patients.
There is something that allows you to continue.
If you register, you will get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott joined the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last one of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Subsequent scans showed no evidence of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I have just been 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That is vital.
Once again, Abbott has undergone six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no trace of the tumors.
But the process is physically and mentally demanding.
They need to think about practical things - about money when I am no longer, for example.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
They must look to the future.
As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents this is difficult," says he.
It is hard to know what to say and how much is to be said.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and undisturbed.
They told their friends and we got very many calls soon.
Ellie was more restrained.
She did not say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to undergo.
But for mesothelioma, such talks are not crossed by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings grim security (as is the end of Stephen Jay Gould).

China denies Hong Kong the right to government elections, protesters swear retaliation.
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by Hong Kong's electorate.
This approach is probably driving the protests that have long been announced in Hong Kong's business district, while activists are planning and mobilizing them within a few hours after the announcement.
In principle, the decision of the Chinese National Congress allows the Communist leaders to expel all the candidates who are not of interest.
"That's not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing had promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong were lied.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-Secretary of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations to the Hong Kong government elections would be chaotic.
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow the residents to elect the government in 2017.
China's leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong's citizens would have direct suffrage, but the decision also made it clear that China's leaders retain control of the process through a closely controlled nominating committee controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates with love for land and love for Hong Kong are to be allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district, stands to deny that Beijing does not allow a genuine right of universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within a couple of hours, hundreds of Occupy-Central trailers had gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks they planned waves of protests.
However, they did not provide information about this, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers said that the movement "the occupation of the central area had only been considered as a last resort, an action that should only take place if all of the options for dialogue have been exhausted and do not have any other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for some days, and stronger security measures, including police forces and barricades, were introduced on Sunday in front of the government building.
The riots are reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The entry of people from the mainland reinforces competition for products and services.
Moreover, there is a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under Beijing's growing pressure.
Some criticized the hold of the Occupy Central Movement as they put business - Hong Kong's lifeline - at risk.
"The protests that they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they will last," said legal expert on Regine Ip, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We do not want to fan fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media recently reported about democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters - engaged in an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 78,000 participated.
In July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school leaving balls in the USA is now transferred to universities, where there are Freshmen appearances with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the first luxury travel service in Britain to students of today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the University, the company also offers transportation such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also admitted that the service had a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to steal their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A business spokesperson said that no new bookings were made as the service had just been introduced, but it added that "students would book the service in the coming weeks."
The company also announced that it would expect a market for this offer despite the tuition fees of £9,000 per year.
Students today differ in their expectations and needs from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Student Alliance, however, criticized the service as being lifted.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who are beginning to study this month are facing a crisis of the cost of living, as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and grants does not keep pace with the sharply rising bills for the simplest bases of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something like the arrival in the student residence.
Feminists are critical of race and police behaviour after Ferguson.
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo..
The participants hoben their hands in the air and sang, "hands high, do not shoot," while they were waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown noticed a change in the online discussion of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
But, while tensions in the Middle East rose and were taken into account throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women turned out to be 100% around the race.
In comparison with the answers of black women, shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "Reason to Ferguson of a White Woman" and "feminism revolved not only on the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think that feminism can find many people who are talking about the white," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the events.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnised that they have to express this.
For English professor KAlgoritha Mitchell of the Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems that are exposed to black American women every day, although they are not regarded as "women's rights" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partners and I get 150 Likes from all over the world," said Mitchell.
When I talk about something about it, like the color in your own country under siege, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship rather than security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who studied race, sex and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women are now combining the themes of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white women like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the fight for the right to vote could only be a success for one group: Women or black women.
"They met the decision to stand up for the right of women, and the right to vote for black women should come later," said Hattery.
When you look at such things, one becomes aware of why coloured women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade before white women were organized against the lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was born almost 40 years after the original request for help from the sides of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists were playing with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"It would not be great if the activists who had such traditional feminist platforms had the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception," Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation, who built their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Stone went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist of the Guardian, in which she asked for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger that is inherent in the body - and opinions on race, which are markedly different in public opinion polls - will lead to change," Steiner wrote.
Although Stone stands for a rather intersectional feminism, where racial and gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on racism in America are puzzled.
Christina Sommer, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole Feminism," said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems to Ferguson are in contrast to their earlier criticisms.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But, when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Stone.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that matters in the foreground of mainstreaming.
After the US border police took up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is returning to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the subject, as one of the most important women in women, she should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
If the vast majority of the working visa goes to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate in women's organisations," she said.
"Pig-house" in Ipswich stands for sale.
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate brokers when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for €120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig that had its head on a sofa.
Real estate broker Connells said that the pig on the photo was the owner of the owner.
"The photo was published erroneously and it has been removed," said a spokeswoman of the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former collecting house as a "unique one-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The sale of houses caused interest in the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is a new millionaire after Lottoprofit.
Harvey is a Lottoplayer from Harvey this month.
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner, who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
For the second time in five years, a newspaper kiosk in Harvey drew the jackpot in the draw of the first division, after 1 million dollars in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner must still be informed.
The shopkeeper Steve Forward said that profit care for talk in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is rather excited.
We thought that such a gain could occur.
Eight Winners celebrated last month in the first division, a fitting conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
In the past week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had achieved the mega-win of $7.5 million only a few weeks ago.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that profit would give them the chance of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire of Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the gladiatorial arena
It was not only the gladiators who stood deep in Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Roman day in the park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday, defying the rain and the cold of cold and enthralled by the historical spectacle.
There were a variety of pictures, shows, games, exhibits, information about the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the naval force of the gladiatorial school "Amor Mortis," who used any period of rain to demonstrate their robust combat art in the Arena that was prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" turned out to be a humorous and knowledgeable presentator and successively sent his men to the ring of the heroic Zweikampf in various gladiatorial raids.
First of all, the "provocators" were on the right arm in the row with a rectangular blade and a short range on the left leg.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, shortwave and litter as well as iron gladiator helmets, tail and armguard.
Particularly impressive was the performance of the "RETIARIUS," which was joined with a worm net, trizag and a dagger against the "SECUTOR" and recently joined the Burschen in a very short time.
As the heavy metal collided, the shields and the limbs floated through the arena, that a fear could be caused by the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an always attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman day of life and present the culture of the Roman times," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friends of the Roman Canal," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, for a day, a Roman city, a Roman city, became a Roman city, which was mentioned in his greeting address.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we are still admiring today.
Remains of this were also appreciated by the Roman day, for example "aqueduct marble" from the eleven metre-long Roman canal bridge, which once stood at ventilation.
The Frontinus Society once confronted the water and energy supply once and now, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still taking advantage of the knowledge of that time."
This is also confirmed by Ralph Heiliger from the "Engineering Team Zwei" from Rheinbach, the surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocrites, the hot air conditioning that was once the Roman villa.
Impressive are the footprints that had been left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of sound before burning them.
In 2011, the Office for Territorial Heritage of the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the industrial park Nord in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building were found with a darre for drying grain and malt.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, a farm, the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A series of finds from these excavations was presented in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the Germanic Germans arrived in the then Roman Rhineland.
They also dealt with the Roman windmill, similar to today's millstone, as Roman students once wrote their names with metal sides on wax boards.
At the stand of the Roman thermal springs Zülpich, the children were allowed to make mosaics, at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach Glasmosaiken, at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim, using a heavy wheat mill made of stone, in order to grind the flour for a pancake or a cereal.
The visitors went through the park and came here at the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman-project weeks."
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be involved in the Roman year 2014, which is to be remembered for the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander association, the partnership association and the Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and remembered by the Roman past of the history of the town.
For example, a Roman legionnaire from his work is presented by his work on the mountain of Wachtberg, presenting plants as live monuments from Roman times and teaching a witty lesson in international understanding between a group Wachtberger "Germanen" and the Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous, often unseen traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be re-experienced at the first glance.
In the town hall of Wachtberger you will find a small presentation of the discovery of the mountain of Matlon in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is afflicting West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go on distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rotates in the fields, the mines are deserted and the markets are orphaned - the virus has made the region difficult.
Some international companies are also distancing themselves from distance.
"Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," explains Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest hit
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
The market only comes to who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, but more than 600 people have been killed by the fever.
The health authorities recently declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people, thousands of others, died.
Foreign Companies Get Employees
Firms operate everywhere in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies like Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local merchants and farmers are also reacting: Few merchants still leave their home cities in order to supply supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, we have eradicated the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export.
Farmers dare not leave their homes for harvesting.
Food Goes Again
"People will travel less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.
The man for example, who is normally on the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore receives the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: Food is running out.
On the markets, stocks of staple foods like rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is highly dependent on international companies, is threatened by an image of image - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will spread.
In the case of investors, the impression can be given that "it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia."
The disease also places strain on the countries' strained national budgets.
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the states concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be greatly strained by the high levels of spending on the healthcare system and by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are also being felt in Nigeria, where few Ebola cases have so far been diagnosed.
It is true that the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people already remain in fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced.
To Protect Your 50th Anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Berngau Foundation celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
Preparations for the 50-year-old foundation from 12 to 14 September are scheduled for full tour at Schützenverein Tannenwald.
It is planned on Friday, September 12th, a great night of entertainment with the group "Dorfrocker."
On Saturday, the big villain will take place at 6 pm.
After that, in the big marquee, the mood evening is with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam."
Blaskapelle provides music for music.
Highlights on the Sunday are the celebration of the sacrament and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the great feast at 14.00.
In the afternoon the price distribution of the Federal and Gauge is also included.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festivals with their Dirndln.
Festkapelle is the brass band of Berngau.
The patronage has been taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907 when the association was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime had initiated the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men, who were born on 30 April in Gasthaus Lukas, were born in Berngau.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a champion for a difficult initial period, in which it was primarily a matter of finding a club and installing the shooting range.
Already in the fall of 1965, the Schützenverein at the Gasthaus "Leininger" started with two teams in the lap competitions.
In the following years, the sporting workers who were now organised in seven teams were established in all classes to the 1st Gauleague.
For the first time in 1980, Rudi Meier, a member of the Board of Directors and the magical border of 380 rings was reached by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooter has increased, the membership numbers have developed positively.
After the association "Leininger" no longer satisfies the demands of a modern society, the then Board of Management under the leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988, the pastor for the new trenches gave the church blessing to the church.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaushoot, combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooter in July 1991.
On the 23rd and 24th of April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a bad group was set up.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the direction of the Bavarian Böllertreffen in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the club members have modernised the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof last year, thus bringing it to the cutting edge of technology.
Eleven teams in lap competitions
The sporting achievements of the association can also be seen.
In total, eleven teams are currently taking part in the lap competitions: Six air gun crews, an airgun crew, a fighter KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Keller is set up in the district league 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen to the Gauoberleague.
In addition to shooting sport, there are events such as Bocking, Carnival and Königsball.
With this the pupils are also at the festivals in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffered an accident when he returned to the race track.
Tony Stewart's return to the circuit ended halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went to the wall for the second time, after his right hand stretched in round 172 and his evening ended.
Stewart drove his damaged car in the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that his 14-headed team was disappointed, but he now concentrates on the race this weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We drive to Richmond and hope that we can do it better.
Stewart already went into a wall on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to get the right side of his car repaired.
"I have good hopes for a good result today," said Johnston, who added: "It simply didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewarts was loaded into the tractor and the team had packed up and was ready to leave.
Stewart was the first to be NASCAR Sprint Cup, after his car hit another driver at an ash race in the north of New York and killed him.
He decided to return this week and to win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his job, while an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. was investigated during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities reported on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken on whether Stewart has to reckon with charges.
The three-time champion was received with great acclaim when he was presented before the race.
After a start to the 12th position, Stewart had briefly penetrated into the first 10 and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a reboot in round 122, bushs began to fall.
Car with No. 18 out of control after the curve 2 and collided with Stewart, where both cars drove against the wall.
Stewart went on, but fell back to place 21.
The Beginning of Dancing Dreams
Just try it: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Director Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to contributors.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in the TV Jahn also make it possible to take full day classes at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have sharply decimated.
Now we are looking for more talent for a sport that is healthy and has great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, a former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits," there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of 8 to 12 year olds, six in the group of the 12-15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more athletes the whole thing would make much more fun, "you could dance other choreographies," she says.
Anyone who wants to dance can take a look at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without any obligation.
"Training begins regularly with a warming programme," says the trainee.
After that, various choreographies will be carried out.
Jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical music to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, sociability is not too short.
"We are also going to eat, you can see dance films and we have already stayed in the dance room," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot of your own motor development.
For those who don't like jazz dance, you can also take a look at one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always take lessons in the lessons in the areas of children's dance, jazz dance, bamboo ballet, video clip and hip-hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult pairs are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you are interested in Discofox, Langberry Walzer, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango may stop by and take part.
Protesting Bulgaria's Prisoners nationwide
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Even higher salaries are on a list of demands that are to be discussed with the interim Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
In spite of the meeting between the union of prisoners and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached that reported the national Bulgarian debt (BNR).
The negotiations are continuing, the Director-General for the implementation of sanctions, roses Zhelyazkov agreed to BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian Army of Luhansk Airport
In eastern Ukraine, prorussian fighters continue to advance.
After hard battles in which Russian tanks were reportedly also involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk, has given up.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine had previously drawn personnel from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without mentioning the details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot aircraft from
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussal separatists on their own account have once again fired a combat aircraft and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in the region of Donetsk, according to the insurgents on Monday Russian agencies.
Ships of Coastguard
The insurgents also claimed that for the first time in the sea of Azov there were two boats from the Ukrainian coastguard.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of its ships were under fire on Sunday near the port town of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, said one speaker in Kiev.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several villages in the area of Donetsk had been brought under their control.
Diplomacy in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group meets today in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, there should also be an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine.
In the run-up, all of the actors took advantage of their appearances on the public announcement of their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO is not going to break its agreement with Russia by the planned stationings in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is following the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a flagrant breach of the agreement."
"Today we have to face up to reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
Documents and opinions from the Russian side show that "they see us as an opponent."
Strengthening NATO's presence
Rasmussen also announced that he would strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have a more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow on New Gas Talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks on the settlement of their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for Saturday, as Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It will wait for a decision by the European Union, whether it is also a representative for the talks.
Because of the dispute over gas prices, Ukraine has been receiving no fuel from Russia for weeks.
Finally, the Commissioner for Energy had communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine has warned that Russia may also interrupt the supply of gas to Europe.
Europe accounts for about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, one of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power: Toll will be "very clear."
Now the Chancellor has made it clear once again that it is.
However, it is not a licence for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against tolls on cars have visibly softened the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken of a power word for the introduction of a car toll following persistent opposition from her CDU.
"To make it very clear: It is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU leaders in Berlin.
For the time being, Merkel failed to define a detailed model.
In the black red government program are called "certain parameters."
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal and is now working on it.
The NRC-CDU, however, persists in its "no" to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also made a constructive contribution to the discussions on a draft legislation.
Beyond the subject, he also talked with Dobrindt about other ways to enable more private capital to invest in infrastructure, including in broadband.
Schäuble had left a "mirror" report in place on Sunday, and his house considered his own concept to compensate highway investors with tolls - after the election in 2017.
CSU Chairman Horst Seehofer then warned against developing tolls against the minister responsible in the Cabinet.
CDU's Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all of the circular and federal roads were to be painted," said the CDU of the CDU in West Rhine-Westphalia.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that it will speak again on the subject.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU state associations of Baden-Wuerttemberg and the Rhineland Palatinate.
The background is that a toll affects small border traffic with neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had asked for its toll from the ranks of the CDU coalition.
The Left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said leader Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll the minister fails," Dobrindt wants to introduce a duty of vignetting on all German roads that are to start in 2016.
However, according to the Association Agreement, domestic car owners should not be subjected to additional charges.
That is why they are supposed to receive a full compensation for tolls via the motor vehicle tax.
The model should not, however, penalise foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often wrongly diagnosed
One Britin says that she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all of her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another illness.
She actually suffered from the Charcot Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnoses are a common problem for people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe cycle and curved toes.
The disease is incurable and progressive, and it means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers 13 was, she believed that she had a graveyard (IAs), a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she would be 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who is 51 years old said: "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I constantly fell and everything lasted for me longer.
I could never ride with the other children rolling shoe or skateboard and was often left in school because of my way of going and going.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve their Achilles tendance and the impact of their feet, she looked at her hospital when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from IAs.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I did not tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I was given a reply, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought that with 18 I would be in a wheelchair and would die with 25.
I made all this with me alone and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she was 17, she became aware that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up, hugging me and saying, "My love, I don't think you've got that, lest you are already in a wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, it was found in its CMT.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt as if I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Awareness Month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working since the closure of the former troop force.
For almost ten years, the former troop of troops in Münsingen is no longer being fired.
Nevertheless, lethal ammunition is still appearing in the heart of the biosphere reserve of Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be blown on the ground.
A deafening bang resonates with the explosives over the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot on the prison area of Münsingen was closed down after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005.
Since then, the 6500 hectares have been at the heart of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open to 13 designated trails for hikers and cyclists.
Taxation of businessmen in the region of Washington is rising with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
Public and local tax breaks for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published study took place last week, and firms in the Washington region were no exception.
Companies in the district, Maryland, and Virginia paid together $27.6 billion to public and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8% over the 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The public and local tax burden on companies rose by 4.3% last year, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9% per year, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes rose more sharply than local taxes, by 4.3%, according to the study that was carried out by the Ernst & Young service agency with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of District tax revenues come from corporate taxes, while 36% of Marylands come from companies.
Virginia accounts for 28% of the lowest tax revenue from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is based on a recovery in the property values of companies, the researchers say that an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7% this year led to growth rates of less than 1% this year after the three consecutive years.
While much of these gains came from large states like California, New York, and Texas, the process also seems to be reaching Washington.
Businesses in the district, Maryland, and Virginia paid out more than $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to €9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2% over a year.
But the seeming recovery in real estate assets is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes amount to little more than one-fifth of companies in tax.
Companies in Virginia and DC pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the real estate, especially in the fiscal zone around D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay for property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland, therefore, is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market.
Company revenues also seem to recover, so the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes for government organisations from $2.3 billion to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland accounted for $1 billion in income tax, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly across all three places.
The entry rate in the District was 4.3% of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported an above-average tax rate of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6% in all three areas of office, has the markedly lowest corporate income tax (all three in all three).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and a relatively high 9.975 percent in the district.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower levels of government and local taxes are required, and there is a better tax climate than that in Maryland.
The District was not investigated in the study.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed legislation to reduce corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5% next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state income tax rate by 2017 to 3%.
In the meantime, small businesses seem to be doing better in Washington, and they are therefore paying more public and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure in which most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland, and Virginia grew 20% last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate tax.
Researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes across the country will probably last this year, with an increase in the general government tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 in comparison with the same period of the previous year.
Yet, if the federal government's spending cut has an impact on the region, the Washington region may lag behind.
Partner City: German Beer for Guangzhou.
Hop and malt - a popular combination in China.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's twin city in China now wishes a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - is the urgent desire of the officials in China.
"We would be delighted if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said the Deputy Secretary of Congress, Li Yiwei, when he visited a SPD delegation in his city this week.
Time and again, the functioning of the ruling Communist Party has returned to this concern of the Twelve million.
Guangzhou, also known as the canton, is one of the richest cities in China.
That is why people also have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD leader, Thorsten Schäfer Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be interrogated in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
"For beer it does not need much: Good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party upper in Guangzhou.
This joie de vivre, which Mr Li already enjoyed, flattened the host.
As a result of this, the function from Guangzhou came with Schäfer Gümbel - however, with red wine, which was served to the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business
A second desire of the Chinese host would be a flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party chef Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," local politician showed.
"Commerce between our two cities continues to grow."
At present, travellers would have to take the detour through Changsha in Hunan Province.
Also the administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is hoping for the flight connection.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," said Schäfer Gümbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany.
The Partnership for Partnership
Guangzhou's leuttering Vice Chairman hopes that he will be able to attend a partner meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but he is not yet in this function.
He was only in office this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office for corruption charges.
The local leader, Wan Qinglian, also had to go.
The action against Guangzhou's officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration that is being enforced harshly by leader Xi Jinping.
The new leader Li Yiwei had been working for an American company in his party career, which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top designer in Fujian, where he built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen town-twinning activities.
The connection to Guangzhou's 9000 kilometre distance is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South China metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen with its economic strength.
In the next year she wanted to reach a gross domestic product of €250 billion, Li reported.
The family of Joan Rivers "expresses the thumb."
Joan Rivers became unconscious when she arrived at a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter was hopeful today that the 81 year-old is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We will keep our fingers crossed.
According to her mother, on Thursday, after an emergency, she was hospitalized in a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy in the Mount Sinai.
Doctors consider them to be intentionally sewed and closely monitored until they are more satisfied that they are still described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sites, even in the form of an overwhelming online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners in trade from today.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from 1 September are given a label on which the buyer can see at a glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, the pollutant category "Euro 6" will have more stringent nitric oxide values.
In addition, there is more money for scaffolding: They receive a uniform minimum wage of EUR 10.25.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion.
Amazon confirmed just now what information had been reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a lot of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected to take over Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google for a cool billion was decided, and cooperation also appeared of course.
Twitch, which was founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their Bravourts in games, a "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which the better of games give a painting of intelligence theater (mostly older) are already very popular on YouTube.
It is true that YouTube is often mentioned when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy is bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not happen, because the company reported that it was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say that they prefer to practice sports than to watch, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes from watching others in the games instead of taking control of the control panel.
It is one thing to take a look at a friend by 3 in the morning, while resident Evil, and something quite different, is watching a guy as he shot 20 times in the call of Duty.
You could see all of these games now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are now ego games, so the audience can be a good recipe for headaches without control over the eye.
I admit that the quick-runs in which the Roger Banners of our electronics era complete whole games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as it is not a game or human virtuoso, his Twitch-channel is unlikely to be so interesting.
But what do skeptics know about this?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated in Amazon Instant Video, as YouTube Twitch could easily swallow.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: Thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers.
As the Chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both of the future of the gaming," and the medium shows no signs of contraction, even at night - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot to do on Saturday at the "Hüpfburg" at Burggarten.
The concept of the organizer was right.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday evening, it is estimated that there were 1200 music fans at the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the admittance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salty of light and fun.
Out of two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name of Amula.
The Open Air in the salt refiner Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness on the day and in the evening through various shows.
And the fun comes from you alone.
This was already evident at the early Saturday, when the first visitors started to visit the Open Air.
A feast for all generations was promised by the organizers.
And they have succeeded in doing so.
Around the castle grounds there were salt refiners, but also guests from the close and wider surroundings.
They watched the first live performances, and cool drinks were enjoyed with the foot in the beat - in short, pure relaxation and pleasure were announced.
And this across generations.
While the white sand on the ceiling was lying on the beach bar, others were preparing for a quarter of the wine in the wine cellar, and the younger generation on the hip raged on the hip, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
In the truest sense of the word, however, the volunteers had to do all of their hands in the truest sense of the word, in order to become a member of the Andrang and to conjure up imaginative creations in the little faces.
They made use of the Kickertables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot crew made out of salt.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he put down on the visitors, especially families who were looking for the space and the dry.
But the appeal of the festival did not detract from this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."
That is why there is nothing to do with a repeat of the big party next year.
Although further work needs to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear in a first record on Sunday in front of the popular vote.
He described it as annoying that, in the meantime, the admittance had to be stopped.
Apparently the security company had been booked with too few forces.
The result: Some who had already paid no longer came to the area.
The response was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the salt refiner spoke of about 1200 visitors, who took part in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound technology.
The salt refiner Hip-Hop band Blocks 'n'Rox broke off their performance away.
The technicians were unable to create a fairly reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt because of a tyre.
"In the next year, they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes, which will be delayed for the first time, but will have to be removed from the second edition.
In the social network of Facebook, too, the organisers have to make criticisms.
"Sorry, but for 12 euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"You have unfortunately taken over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it is very good that some people are trying to put things on their feet.
Hats off," Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.
The organisers will now have time to correct these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark schshrinking
That is not what is expected.
What is more, the prepared component is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the establishment of the Space Observatory, the TIRA will be completely renewed.
With a diameter of 47.5 metres, the new cycle will be slightly smaller than the old one.
However, the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new case is the Kappentausch.
The upper part of the old covering is separated with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new case will be set up.
As far as the weather is concerned, the action is scheduled to take place at the beginning of this week.
The event will take place at the Ice Bucket Challenge.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom shouted out so much that her icy water was cast over his head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge was painful next to it.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she had so much trouble with the Ice Bucket Challenge.
Isabelle Roberts, from Great Britain, so did when her icy cold water was cast over her head that she lost her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I shouted, and while I did, my jaws simply standing," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that did not happen, the pine was blocked, and then I understood that something did not agree.
My mother and my sister saw this and made themselves laugh almost in the pants, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to the hospital in order to resume the jaw after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an Internet sensation and a thousandfold on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the Burgclubs be pulling together soon?
Finally, there has always been a clash between the two Wolfratshauser of Burgundy.
Now we are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, carried out the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgundy friends Wolfratshausen.
Up to now, the positions on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Burg and the possibility of reconstruction seemed very different.
Now the two camps are moving together: Talks on joint action are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the boards of Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on the demand of our newspaper.
"I phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together," said Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both clubs would be able to pull together in the future.
That is how it is possible to achieve visible results more quickly.
While the castle's friends were at the forefront of rebuilding the castle in the mountain forest, Sjöberg was at the forefront of the development of the area.
Herbert Piffl, Chairman of the Burgerie of Burgundy, was delighted to provide information about the call.
From the time of his death, he has been in the hands of the House of Burgundy.
A new president is to be found in a member's meeting in the middle of September.
At the moment the club has about 40 members according to the 74 age group.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have let the association activities rest out of respect for the first time."
According to Piffl, the new president is to go to the talks with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfriends could also make a current mood within their group.
A candidate for the presidency does not yet exist, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself."
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer would like to continue working on the project.
In the eyes of Piffls, the different positions on reconstruction will remain in the near future.
He praises Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.
They are a tourist magnet for a high level of public participation, as well as for volunteers from all over the world.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical about it.
But in the course of time, I have found more and more to believe that it makes sense to push the project forward."
Otherwise there will be nothing here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I don't want to throw the idea of reconstruction on board personally," he hopes that the Burgverein may be moving forward on this point.
Their aim of documenting history first is "important and good."
After that, you could see what is going on.
Clever ways to save at university textbooks
As the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the Fast Zweitsemesterstudent Matt Schroeder overcame a clever saving idea.
He invented a loan dispensation system for books by senior students and offered nominal compensation in order to delay sales.
"My Mathematics usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-bit-a-kek," said Schroeder, 19 who visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required for the last semester would have cost him 430 $, he said.
He gave $120.
The group reported that on average students spend more than 1,200 dollars a year on textbooks and study materials, that there are different cost control options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeder are increasingly the solution to the choice for the students.
The rent of textbooks is more popular, so students can use a book for a period of one semester, often at a significantly lower price than when they buy.
Neebo, which operates more than 250 university shops, announced that the rental of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college books were rented in the last spring embankment, said Neebos Vice President, Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are bought by the National Association of College Stores in Campus Buchstores.
Here is the unique one for the best deals.
Buying Online
Some new books cost only one third of the price for which they are in the campus bookshop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased at the specialized Chegg.com textbook dealer for 239.99 $.
How to Buy
If one of the notes of other or normal usage tracks is nothing, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for 93.49 $.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduation student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to ask their professors whether previous editions were allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar are not relevant.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest output.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.
Renting
The rental of textbooks is worth considering if you treat it to some extent, remember to return it and do not want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a newly purchased book.
A student, for example, could hire "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the regulations of the business in which you are renting, including the penalty fees that may arise for the writing of notes, underscores or usage tracks.
Hirer: If you do not return the book, the penalty charges may exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
Even E-Books instead of traditional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are rented in de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for about $61 for 6 months.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, because many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look at each case.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be visiting Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the pricing of books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And, before an online order is placed, you should check for yourself whether the book is in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery and finally paid the full price in the college bookshop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" was not a blockbuster
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of its $90 million in the US, while "Sin City: A Queen to Kill For "only $12 million in his budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" that is tailored to Cameron Diaz has played only $14.6 million in the opening weekend, while children's films are also disappointing in terms of revenue.
One article of the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that in children's films the lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves.
Collin referred to 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films.
In films for a somewhat older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic rating for each summer film start that was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and at least 2000 screens in the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming jungle film film, said to the website Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."
We need to accept that and do not try to emulate the past.
In contrast to the currently weak spot results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated sales of $1.2 billion in streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to 837 million dollars.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing on comics and predicting a "meltdown of Hollywood."
In the light of the present downturn, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy could contain a real core.
However, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic in view of the potential blockbuster expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in the results of the cash as being simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporters: "The next summer will be the greatest summer in the cinema at all, and no one will worry more about the business."
When, a few years ago, the second table of table tennis was removed for the streamlining of the leagues, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the programme.
The result: Those who have not risen up have gone off.
However, in the next season, Captain Torpedo, who has avoided the descent, is still only five stars in the coming season.
Torpedos ladies, despite their grandiose cross in the regional league, are classified as fourth.
The boys and girls of Torpedo are starting in the Netherlands, just as the boys of the SC Weend.
SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserve are in the new League's League, and in the national league there are no more represented in Göttingen.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the League's League, the Torpedo Second in the League of Nations.
What looks like a better area of the county is now the new district of the South.
Here there are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the county league there are regional representatives of Dransfeld and SC Weavers, in the county class of TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
In the county league start Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen.
With each of the nine teams.
The SC Weaving sends his girls to the small county league.
Also the district league relay of the SCW boys, where Torpedo II is launched, is not complete.
In a county class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded Regionsverband, the two goddesses of Göttingen start with each of the nine teams.
In the West relay are the red-white II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East Season you can play Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The ladies district league consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG rhume.
This is still better than in Osterode, where there are no longer any female teams on the circle level.
It is striking that none of the six cycle classes are achieved, and this is where the innovative and transformable circle of directors will have to think about it.
NATO Summits: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend, there were protests from opponents of the NATO Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered to an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, some 150 people in Cardiff came together to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed developments in the weekend for us and talked with demonstrators who went to Belgium from Bridgend.
Flying out of the Blue Mountains
Two young boys were brought into safety with the rope winch after they were caught in the blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke off in Govetts Leap in Blackheath shortly after noon on Sunday.
Worried relatives called the police around 20: 00 when the two had not returned home.
A search rod from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found around 23: 00 in the vicinity of the Bridal Veil Waterfalls.
The girl had fallen on his knees and the man was toppled and had beaten his head.
Rescue forces stayed overnight at the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were supplied in a stable state with a ambulance in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
The about 1000 demonstrators were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
After half an hour, the transmitter has resumed the broadcasting.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged equipment in the editorial.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
The demonstrators are asking for the resignation of the Heads of Government to accuse them of electoral fraud.
The police announced, around a kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, that there were around 3000 protesters with security forces again on Monday.
After hospital information, a policeman was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to go to Sharifs Residenz.
They are calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict, "to waste no time and to use force without violence."
It also said in the communication: 'The army has a role to play in ensuring the security of the state.'
The escalation of violence has fueled concern about military intervention, which has already spread more frequently in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and Prediger Tahirul Qadri have been taking place since Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters to stand up on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qadri was similar to that.
Khan reproaches Sharif to have won the parliamentary elections in May last year by means of fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and launch new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the government district.
The demonstrators initially had to wait peacefully in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them on the weekend to go to Sharifs Residenz.
Hütteldorfer after two season victory on the table of three of the table.
With the 2: 0 above Grödig, a conciliatory end took place for Rapid on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate chief in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The experience of success was extremely important," confirmed Captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who presented three of them with green white.
With the second season of the season, Schammel-Traumtor has shown the right response to the disappointment at Helsinki with the second season of the season and is taking a chance of success in the Country Game Hour.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said Thomas Schrammel, who has set the course for victory with his superb guided Volley from the 14th of the 14th.
"I thought I had all the frustration of Thursday," the 26-year-old said.
When Schammel on 13th November 2010 had met in a Bundesligapartie last time, this was still for Ried.
The first master in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I am from rapid-help," said Schammel.
As a result of Mario Pavelic's short range of pools, he moved from the left to the right defensive side and made it a very good thing.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise that position.
The door has earned him, he has already done some assimilation this year," Barisic praised.
Team shows character Schrammel, also delivered the flange to 2: 0 by Hofmann after a good one hour that finally brought the decision.
That is because it would have been possible for the guests to be able to write.
"God thank God we have had some luck today," he also noted that the gap between performance and result in the last few weeks was noted: "The results did not vote, but the playful was always good in comparison with last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games it was better than today" against "the strongest team that played in this stadium in this season."
The first triples since 26 July have therefore shown that the team is intact despite the setbacks: "Today, my team has shown that it has character."
For him, it is also pleasing to say: 'We have finally played back to zero.'
A lot of work done during the period of the country. Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger there are several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their start out of the season, making the victory even more valuable.
"We must not forget this," said Barisic, who lost in the last three days with a friend and Pavelic player, "who have been very stable in recent times."
For this reason, the term of the country must be used to "lick wounds and get a bit in the physical area," as Barisic, who has five U21 selective players in its ranks, has declared.
Captain Hofmann is one of those who have a special interest in the break.
He descends for the team, passes through pain.
Especially during this difficult period he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann not only gave the structure to the game of Rapids before he was confused in the 68th minute, but he also achieved the second goal.
For the 33-year-olds who completed his 350, he was the first hit in the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 on the Admiralty).
Hofmann: "may not believe that everything is good now," "We have certainly also had a bit of luck, but at some point the luck must come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
However, he warned of concentrated further work: "You cannot always see this in black and white.
We have not played so badly in the last few weeks, as has been pointed out.
However, we must not believe that everything is good now.
He was unable to dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can help at the moment.
They keep to me in certain phases," said Hofmann.
Large-coach Michael Baur had little to do with his team.
He regretted the fast opposition from the category of magic, as well as the regular Nutz in the 40th minute, which was wrongly dismissed by arbitrators.
The only accusation that I can make of the team is that we were not concrete enough in some phases.
We have had too few accounts.
Interior protector Maximilian Karner saw it in a similar way: "It has started badly, but then we found it and even made a gate.
By and large, there would have been more in it.
There is a Ruh among the summits
A mighty tribe showed us how to handle the summer series "My piece of the Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still in the county.
A long walk on foot leads up to the 600 years old oak.
It goes past barges, basalt clusters and basalt stones.
A little bit below the quarry from the Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, it stands.
Vital looks like a natural monument, it stands out above the other trees of the area and reminds of an American mosquito over eight metres above sea level.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that this is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was no evidence of the name of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer archives and interviews older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what is the relationship with the scourges.
The result of his investigation was the rather sober explanation of the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the animals of Unterweibrunn were to have driven their animals from Unterweibrunn.
At the foot of the tree, the animals exhausted by the rise should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has gained its meaning, because in the meadows it is actually back to goat farming.
The area has also been declared to be the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When entering the stone collections you should be careful because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular location for crossers.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweistebrunn to the tree, but it is something that is hidden.
Other routes are signposted to climb up towards Hochrhön and invite you to an extended hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, it is rare to find a water castle that is sought in our next task.
The reflection in the ditch gives a good impression of the building, but in the county we have some historical buildings that could fit the building.
Where is our "slice of the Rhöner Glück"?
My piece of Rhöner Glück
As with previous series of the main post in previous years, there are also prizes to be won again this year, if they have the right solution.
Anyone who likes to take photographs can also take part.
Under the e-mail address red.neustadt @ mainpost.de you can send us the solution and also your very personal "piece of the Rhöner Glück" under this keyword.
The most beautiful photos will be published.
After weeks of war, Italy's prime minister and EU president, Matteo Renzi, won the nomination of his Secretary of State Federica Mogherini in the EU foreign policy last week against strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit; she will be the successor of Britin Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, which portrays the government of La Repubblica in the government, believes that its appeal in the government team as Favorite is in favour of strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
It also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to ensure that the left-wing party base, which is constantly rising against him, is placed in a calm way, because Mogherini is assigned to this - albeit in a more moderate way - in moderation.
With regard to the conservative representatives with the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the Council, Donald Tusk is going to have the prevailing opinion in Rome in order to strike a political balance.
The EU's chief diplomacy, at the same time, is vice-president of the President of the Commission.
The continued approval of the European Parliament is regarded as being safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called a "significant recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU for the nomination of the 41-year-old leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD).
The Repubblica is optimistic that Mogherini, who has been renowned for its ambition for almost two decades, will be able to face up to the "huge challenges."
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
She began his career in politics in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left-wing Democrats), who joined the Catholic Zentrumy Margherita in 2008 as president of the Social Democratic Party.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
With the election in the party council of the left-wing democrats in 2001, she joined the party politics, working in the foreign policy department, of which she was soon elected.
She occupied the traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, and studies of NATO in Afghanistan, in which Italy was involved with a contingent contingent in Afghanistan, used the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert in defense and European and international affairs.
When Renzi was Premier in February 2014, he led Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40% of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD, Federica Mogherini is a part of that.
The reproaches in Brussels that the new EU external representatives have too little diplomatic experience, in other words, lack the substance of the PD.
In Brussels, above all of Poland and the Baltic States, Mogherini's realistic policy of crisis in Ukraine, as well as a policy that is in danger of being violated, is being diffused.
It is in favour of the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian firm Gasprom, which is intended to transport Russian gas directly to southern Europe, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi began his presidency as President of the EU in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first visit to Moscow.
Photos that they showed with Putin in the Shake-hands were greeted with indignation in Brussels, just as they invited the Kremlin boss for October to a summit in Milan.
A total of nine young people started training at EMZ-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This is a trainee who has already completed a different training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will be active: Electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All apprentices come from the county of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bookl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer out of forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel carefree and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees from all ages and the instructors travel to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, there are one-day hikes and rafting on the Inn on the programme.
The company counts 435 and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees is distributed over 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths and put France in order," said the main ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the disputed socialist president, the cabinet of which met with disapproval by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite heavy demands for relaxation of the regulation by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Hollande urgently called on his co-socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, strayed into the gearbox in which she appeared in a meeting of renegade socialist members of parliament, and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, derided the Socialist's constant defeat of the Socialists and said that it could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, she is forced to form a new government if the old one has not survived a summer.
"and the new ones will not survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen towards supporters.
She repeated her party's call for a resolution by Parliament and said that it was confident that it would emerge as the winner in early elections and be ready to the government.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in the local elections in March, and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party is in danger of disintegrating into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's tenure in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion dollars.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, according to the experts of the industry, leads to advanced negotiations for the acquisition of competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for around $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
Agreement could be reached this week, the sources said Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a share of 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues stood at $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13% compared with 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues of $1.2 billion in 2013, an increase of 6 percent compared with the previous year.
The cruise industry is a total of about $29 billion, and in the coming years it is expected to be strengthened by the strengthening of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
Companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises requested the IPO of the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million $Deal.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cross passenger service provider of Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino company under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in 2008 in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, at the end of June, according to the admission authorities, 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held a share of 8 percent of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise, together with the original application documents for the stock exchange of Prestige Cruises, have more than 82% of the passenger capacity on American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists are condemning China on the day after the election decision.
A loyal group of experts waved the Chinese flag close to the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday, allowing only two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership in 2017.
All candidates must first of all achieve the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with fringe members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be admitted to the election, and has led pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and wield the financial field of Hong Kong with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong, and China's leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper that set out in June China's dominance over Hong Kong, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and organised a sit-in there.
Lis survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, as well as the Deputy Director of the Office for Affairs of Hong Kong and Macoff of the Council of State, should be consulted in the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in Hong Kong in the afternoon in front of the head office in Hong Kong.
Britain did not see any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150 year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands that Kiev include "sovereign talks" with Ostukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media, according to Russian media reports, on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately accept negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area of eastern Ukraine, under the control of the separatists, would become part of Russia, but that his status with Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiev government of negotiations on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy that he has followed since the beginning of the riots five months ago: Aid to the separatists when areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija to be able to establish de facto independence for an alliance
In an interview with the state television channel channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the reconquest of the areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
In recent times, the Kremlin and the separatists have described the area that has been taken out as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland," a term that recalls the pre-revolutionary glory of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 October, and while government groups attacked civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, are attacking in early peace talks are "caught in their illusions," Itar Tass reported.
"We need to engage in a detailed discussion of it as soon as possible, not only on technical matters, but also on the political organisation of the society and the state of the state of the south-east, in order to protect the interests of the people who live there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood should be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kievans to dispel fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, said Peskov.
It is not a question of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin's clarification on correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks highlighted Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct invasion of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the time before the conflict resulted in a large majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would allow regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control of an area that connects the Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula annexed to the Black Sea five months ago is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy and an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov-area in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries, producing important components for the Russian military.
Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko, in his speech at the inauguration on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider amendments to the constitution, which grant the respective regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast with those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels who are being accused of arming and incitement to Moscow.
Putin's last request to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing was followed by a further incursion by the rebels last week, following Russian troops and tanks invaded by the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the hands, which, according to Ukrainian security officials, was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have begun to build Mariupol, a steel industry with 500,000 inhabitants, who lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and urgently asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take concrete action, the leadership called for further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force with an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko said.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were included in the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk, were replaced on Sunday with 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured a week ago on Ukrainian territory, as Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photography around Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger over hackers, who were probably stealing nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who Who the A-Promis from Hollywood stolen.
The film city is in excitement, after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have appeared in a hacking scandal about celebrities on the Internet.
The hacker, who is responsible for this, has more than 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "the tributes of panem" and of superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande, Lea Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Out of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were reportedly publicized as a result of a icloud void.
On the list are 101 promis.
Edelsten, who died last month with Grecko, said to confidence: "It is disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, said that a news website said that the hack was "shameful" and that the people concerned felt "hurt."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which they are located at the top of a pool.
"Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the chopped pictures.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ: "It is an abhorrent violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen convicted the hackers in his tweet: "chopped images to post from a mobile phone is nothing other than the sale of Hehlerware."
From a legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers were in the process of working on the Great Field yesterday, thus supporting the "Help for Crebskable Children" association.
The tour, which was one of the tortures, was a light training for the others.
Everyone agreed on one thing: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski is likely to have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel Brewery went on the field yesterday with the bicycle.
For the good cause.
It is easy to take away the small muscle of the muscles, especially as the participation on the 8th of the cycle on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for Children of Cancer" (Frankfurt) has personally brought a valuable insight into it.
It is a great thing.
"I now know that I can!
Small donkeys on the way in the applet?
Snow, if I would have stopped once, had been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is in charge of the CDU in the city of Upper Austria, many of the 718 participants were subjected to mountains yesterday in spring and came close to the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the 11 km long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
The green politicians from the circular - red tape, red bike - made something of understatement at the start ("Any number of professionals, that's the goal!"), but in the mountains it turned out to be half-professional, after 45 minutes without breath of breath.
He also passed the track in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press officer of the city of Oberursel, who together with Frank Grüneisen had made his way.
For the two teams of triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is all about charity, we are happy to take part in it - we would have made an exit today," Kuhn said.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) was left to Oberursel in the morning to walk again.
In the morning at 9 o'clock in the saddle, the Frankfurt Florian Zierz had to roll the field two times, so that they could roll home with pleasure.
Fun also had "Fritten Toni."
Bike tours across Feldberg are easy for the chef of the Oberursel.
He had fired 40 minutes with his 6.5 kilo race bike.
It is a crazy event.
For this purpose - I'm happy with it," Andreas Balzke said.
The trained Mainzer says that he is an "ambitious racer."
That's what he needs to be, because he was on the road with the "fix" bike, which is also racing bikes...
That it also went up without a wheel, proved not only the 20 hikers who climbed up above the White Wall and the fusion to the summit, but also a jogger who gave a string of powers with weights behind them.
He was one of the first to travel to Germany, and he was one of the first to travel to Germany.
The 718 participants - and as many as ever - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The trekker was first at 9.30 in the morning.
It was followed by the first cyclists and runners at 10.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers left.
