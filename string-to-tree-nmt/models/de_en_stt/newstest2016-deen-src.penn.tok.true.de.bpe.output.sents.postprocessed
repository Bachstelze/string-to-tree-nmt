Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teheran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
When it comes to meetings, however, it is also to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution that has been discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises Israel's ongoing settlement of settlements, accusing Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
Obama's deal to the Iranian nuclear program has continued to deteriorate the relationship of the two.
In March, at the invitation of Republicans, Netanyahu held a controversial talk before the US Congress that was partly considered to be an issue against Obama.
There was no mention of Obama with Obama, and a meeting rejected it with reference to the imminent election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor admits that his girlfriend has shot dead.
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told a slightly angry voice to the police that he shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house.
It was important to emphasise that his pet dog still live and is likely to be excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead could be found on the mobile phone.
Inside the house, the officers found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was tied to a white block: I wanted to reverse it, I wanted to reverse it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved it.
ES gave no hint that Lamb, who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school area where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular historical professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University of Police said that university employees have heard this at 10: 18 o'clock.
He said that lamb eventually made the fateful call for it.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life when the police left him.
One day after the shooting at the University, which forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details of what the investigators published at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees told him helped to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they were happy with his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal background.
Schmidt himself mentioned lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the wonderful people with whom he shared his Academic life.
Both understated in the Social Sciences and History Department, whose school includes 17 members, and many students visited courses of both.
At the same time, there have been some inclinations about problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon beavers who praised the Lamb, he also seemed a little excited and nervous, as if something was wrong with him.
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to contend with stress at the end of the Academic Year.
Previously, the Delta State University had previously asked for an assessment for reasons of health, saying that it has any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb worked so hard would not give him any guarantee of an automatic way to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but of course there was something in Mr Lambs.
These are questions that lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing from the campus, the police later found a track of Lambs when he was again importing from Arkansas in Mississippi.
Before he was able to be detained, Lamb was self-confident with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house around a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner methel Johnson.
His car was still in the entrance.
ES was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
It was growing in the area.
It began in 2009 its work at the university, the 3,500 students in a town with about 12,000 inhabitants has and geography and pedagogy taught.
He holds a doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of the long-standing friends of Lambs described it as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15, and Lamb was 20 when they met by shared friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar for a few years.
He was the girl of women at that time.
All girls melted when he was present, saying Hairston, 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
There seems to have been some time now for us to come together.
In the emergency call, Lamb said I have killed my wife, but there was no document from a marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house that borders on a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends remained, and a daughter who was 19 years old.
If you were total on the ground, said Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
He never hit Lamb, but his daughter Abigail told him that Lamb was interested in music and that he played the blues.
As he and Abigail emerged three years ago, they were the two of them who took part in a summer of the summer.
Later they played together one or another.
She wrote, wrote his daughter and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a Barkeeper, and sometimes Director of Entertainment at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of 5 September, when lamb ended his guitar and harmonica iel to the end of a short audience.
There was no sign that something was wrong.
Just make a happy pair, he said.
The room was clean and the room was clean.
I think they have both made a good sense of tattoo.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar and specialised in American indigenous people and colonial history, saying Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas, and was president of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening, on the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and members of the community participated in a candlelight commemoration.
Schmidts Frau Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial, while the Universitetschor sang Bright Morning Star in Star Trek and Live Amazing Grace.
The course will be resumed on Wednesday.
Let us try to move our students to move our students, said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis have been told by Cleveland, Mississippi.
Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that lamb in his emergency call called Prentiss as his wife, but there is no hint that the two have ever married.
Toys R & R plans to employ fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us say that it will not be as many as last year as it will be last year, but the toy and baby product retailer is saying that it will give employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company has said that it is planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month will start with the application talks and that the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While holidays are still months away, Christmas is moving closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox joke about his work with Princess Diana.
The premiere of the career back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
We who sat in the theatre are waiting for Royal's royal, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it is gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana next to me will be sitting in a trailer for an upcoming documentary going back to time.
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated ginger and an Armes who is away from being with the Princess of Wales with a date.
Forward interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg, present interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd.
Back for the Future had its premiere 30 years ago.
For me, it is true that it is true to me, said Spielberg, which is the biggest newspaper that has ever been shot.
Return Back in Time will be seen on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN Chairman says there is no military solution in syries.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his answer to Russian has strengthened military support for Syrians: It is true that there is no military solution to nearly five years of conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and to support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France - on the margins of this month's General Assembly ministerial meeting in order to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the arrangements in the Council, and within the Syrian people and the regional powers, make this situation impossible to resolve.
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran when dealing with the crisis in syries.
8 poll results showing that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to mark it as a flop.
Others dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for collapse.
But, however some Republicans try to drag Donald Trump down from the upper ranks in polls, it does not work anymore.
Ten of the last eleven national polls show Donald Trump in the double-digit range, and some are beginning to wonder what it is for the chances of nominating the real estate Moguls.
Of course, it is still too early in office.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at that time Rick Perrys was led to the rising Herman Cain in 2011, of whom no one nation won the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to contend in a general election.
But outsiders such as the Jeb Bush Super PAC and the Conservative Business Group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps and start to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey values that suggest that the real estate Mogul is not just a temporary phase.
Blows of popularity have shot at 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth-University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the Mogul as positive.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60% of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP-voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a survey by CNN ORC said last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either enthusiastic or happy about it when Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be angry if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson who manages the same enthusiasm as Trump says 43 percent would say they would love only 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump.
The next in enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that if Jeb Bush, the of the establishment, would be a candidate, it would be angry with anyone who is unhappy with it.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trumps" temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52% of Irish voters believe that the real estate Mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News by Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies to the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52% of Republicans think he has personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent that he does not have the personality to carry out his office effectively, and almost six of us say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, or ABC.
Republican electorates are getting used to the idea.
If they set their vows, Republican voters regard Trump as real.
If they are asked who wins the GOP-nomination, four out of ten say from CNN last week that Trump is the best bet.
This has been a change since the time when four of the ten of ten of them put their money to Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Total disclosure: GOP-voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win 28% of Mitt Romney's final candidate.
However, it is clear that a large number of GOP-voters regard Trumps' campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans have gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trumps, while anti-corruption support is spread to more than a dozen of other candidates.
But a survey by Monmouth-University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is receiving majority support.
Before Carly Fiorina he has thirteen points, ahead of Marco Rubio 14 points, ahead of 15 points before Jeb 19 points and finally Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
ES is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head race.
The majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have won their votes.
Of course, much action can be taken to change this, and nobody can really say that they never change.
46% said that they leave the door open to move to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trumps is the strongest competitor at the moment of another outsider, the neurochirurg Ben Carson, but constituents who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the subject of immigration.
As Donald Trump called two months ago by Donald Trump from Mexico, the immigration was the hub of public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic language of Trump will keep crucial Hispano-Americans out of the Republican Party and damage the new direction.
But after the new ABC 2012 poll of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump when it comes to immigration issues.
So Solange remains in the limp in the spotlight, it seems that Donald Trump will do.
Frustration with the government is rising to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their makeshift status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new Monday poll of ABC want to say they want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are infuriated to Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register of Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowadis frustrated by the Republicans in Congress are frustrated, with 54 percent dissatisfied and 21 percent of increase in anger.
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany.
The Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex with a view of the North Sea.
In the street a square meter of a roof house costs EUR 73.300 on average.
The offer to Sylt is limited to the offer of objects by nature, so it is stated in the study - therefore it is a high price.
A new study shows in which particular locations of one square meter cost the most.
Of course, EUR 18.70 per square metre for a student bude in Munich is not really limited.
In contrast to Germany's top locations, one of the prizes is like peanuts.
The Real Estate Provider Engel & Völkers has released a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in spiralling heights.
There are tens of thousands of Euro - per square meter, please note.
But it is good who can afford it.
By the way: For once, Munich is not at the top.
Champions League: Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and GÖTZE.
Two-fold Torprotect in Piraeus: Bavarian star Thomas Müller simply has a race.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern, and it was a well deserved 3: 0 at the Olympic Port of Piraeus.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario GÖTZE have created a dream start for the FC Bayern into the mission of Milan.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won a match in the Champions League with the Greek record of Olympic gold in a hot atmosphere due to Müller's double pack. It is earned by 3: 0: 0 with 3: 0.
The twelfth Star Trek in series is scheduled to be the first step towards the final of 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola wants to get to Munich in the third attempt at last.
Müller received his score of 28 in the Champions League for Bavarian leadership with the help of Olympic champion Roberto, who allowed himself to be shot as a flick of the world master.
We will not underestimate them, the captain of Bavaria promised Philipp before the match in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31.688 - and the Munich held the floor.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining.
Piraeus won his most recent six domestic games in the royal class, including prestigious clubs like Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled on 1: 3.
However, Bavaria, which is undefeated in seven Europacup-duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They bravely ran, but in their offensive efforts, however, are often unimaginative to works.
The attacks were too often taken by chance on the left of Douglas Costa, who rarely passed against the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from right than his flank from the right in the upper left of the upper gate.
The last minute of the World Champion was the possible 2: 0.
The best opportunities in half had Robert Lewandowski.
First, as Olympiakos-Stürmer Ideye Brown beat the head ball of Poland from the line 26.
Then, by way of direct delivery, the goalkeeper Roberto with his knees, 35.
Although it was Bavaria who played the dominating game, it was possible to place pirate needle.
However, Manuel New, who was close to Tor, has been able to be seduced.
So, for example, when he shot a shot of Ideye over the bar 56/56.
In front of New, Guardiola defended a four-box with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario GÖTZE, after muscular problems back to the cadre, was first sitting outside.
The World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training, he said Matthias Sammer said that he would have something different from that.
Also during the first move, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the troubled Lewandowski, 59.
GÖTZE arrived late for Arturo Vidal, and thirteen minutes later it was clear that it was one of the first to put it on.
Before the match there was a tie in the stadium.
After a smaller group of Bavarian fans in their audience seemed to have provoked the supporters of Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked them and raced against the supporters of Munich.
At least one Bayern-Fan was transported from the stadium.
People who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth.
Anyone who smokes will harm not only the lung, but also the teeth - that is what a Potsdamer long-term study suggests.
The good news is that if you do not reduce the risk.
Smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth prematurely.
This is the result of the long-term study of an international research team, including several of the staff of the German Institute for Nutrition Research in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers had the risk of prematurely losing their teeth, increasing 2.5- to 3.6-Fache.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main cause of the failure of teeth and the inflammation of the gum is emphasized by the DIFE.
For these periodontitis smoking is a risk factor, emphasize the authors.
The connection between smoking and the loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent grubbing of gums for smokers.
It is not clear whether smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stopped smoking with smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, writing the researchers in the journal of Dental Research.
However, ES can take more than ten years until it is back to the level of non-smokers, as explained by Thomas Dietrich, the English University of Birmingham.
People must be persuaded that they are non-smoking, Heiner told Heiner Boeing of DIFE: Smoking reduces the lifetime of life.
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health and high age.
In Germany, more than 20% of the population of the age of 65 to 74 have been affected by toothlessness, sharing the DIfE.
Earlier studies would have pointed out that smoking would increase the risk of early dental failures.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists meet on the banks of Cologne on remnants of Late Antiquity.
On the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne, archaeological discoveries have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic museum of skeletons and remnants of historical buildings have been excavated, said Museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the start of the construction of the Rhine, historians are looking for so-called bottom monuments.
For all building projects in the district of Cologne, the Museum will always be consulted as a specialist in the field of Archaeology.
In the third part of the Rhine area the archaeologists now find them.
It was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and a church had been a church in the 4th century.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, there was also a cemetery with about 350 graves, which belonged to the church.
Young Women of Goods
After a young woman at the train station is going to the end of the station, the federal police are asking the people to help.
On the early morning of Wednesday morning against 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed the railway station by train at the end of the train, capturing a freight train that came from Mönchengladbach.
As a result of the capture of the train, the federal police have carried out most of the injuries.
She was treated to hospital on site and taken to hospital by rescue personnel.
There is no knowledge of the officials who have been forced to cross the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Strasse are based on L364, the people who come from Linderner Bahn.
Notes which determine the cause of the accident can be given around the clock by means of the Federal Police's free hotline, which will be given by telephone to 0800 6888000 or to any other police unit.
In dispute over TTIP, the EU Commission is proposing new courts before them.
In order to defuse the dispute about the planned transatlantic free trade agreement, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private mediation facilities for disputes between companies and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system which is much more traditional in the way it works.
What we want is for us to set up a system to which people trust them, and the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said that she would do so.
The Swede intends to present the proposal as a European negotiating position for free trade talks with the United States.
The German Government announced its support.
TTIP is intended to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
In concrete terms, the plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures are for the EU states and the US to select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come from the EU, from the United States and from third countries.
For the first time, there is also a second instance of this.
It would allow us to object to judgments.
So far, the parties involved have agreed to each other on the basis of arbitrators, and there has been no possibility of recourse to their judgments.
In the discussion of recent months, it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system of fairness and justice.
In the long term, it wants to work towards an international investment court according to its own specifications.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be resolved.
As one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP, it is true that the investment in investment demanded by large companies is subject to ISDS as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that companies can compensate for compensation to taxpayers at the expense of taxpayers, negotiate national laws, or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first statements, anti-TIP organisations such as Campact identified the Commission's proposals as inadequate.
Most of all criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada with Canada.
On the other hand, the German Minister for Economic Affairs, Matthias Machnig, described plans as great progress.
The Commission has taken into account essential points that have been taken into account in the reform, which has been prepared by the Federal Economic Affairs Minister, Sigmar Gabriel, with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is from the table.
The French Government also welcomed Mrs Malmström's plans.
The European Business Association BusinessEurope warned against restricting economic action by too many new rules.
Particular small and medium-sized enterprises could be penalised if they were to be penalised.
When talks on the free trade agreement on TTIP can conclude the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, it remains unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been going on since the middle of 2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States.
Firstly, a framework for the agreement should be in place by the end of this year.
This deadline is no longer valid.
Delicacy of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at Cologne's Prime Club in Cologne, Luxor.
In addition to this, there is a flipchart on which the shy acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens talk.
He tells about various places that he repeatedly records on the map to report the words about his minutes about his minutes.
Where they were born and how it looks in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be wonderfully creative.
With the 2003 published and third album of Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State, Klug composed songs that can perfectly fit to American folk of the late 1960s.
ES is created by the rumour that Michigan would be the first part of a disappearing series: Each of the 50 US states should be taken into account.
But already in 2004 and in the vicinity of the Rhine, Seven of Seven Swans has already appeared and is expecting certain expectations.
What has been reduced is Stevens here.
Live he meets guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York will return to the series.
This is a masterpiece that is based on the world of science fiction, as it is one of the best in the world of science fiction.
Overborrow of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album grew into the American Billboard Charts and lacks an annual list of influential music media.
After experimenting with extremely productive experiments, Stevens then makes use of very large pieces of electronic envelopes at The Age of Adz in 2010.
This sixth studio album is still orchestrated widely, but it is worn by programmed sequences or beats.
Long ago the smaller clubs will present stage shows here for the colourful spectacle of neon protrusions and large fluorescent stage decorations on stage.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-headed band by Germany.
There is more in the dark of Hamburg.
Theatre mainly presents the Carrie & Lowell which has been available since March.
Although there are now nearly 2,000 guests sitting in their seats, the much more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and to folk.
Without speaking to the public, the group of excellent musicians plays by the widely enriched album.
You hear from the audience: The talk is more opulent than usual, and it is possible to throw away the hard disk.
First she thanked Stevens modestly, he plays a few of the older songs and finally he comes to the applause of the applause.
Jeremy Corbyns for Question Time to the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyns's debut has been eagerly awaited at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn should make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to address the first of his six proposed questions shortly after noon, when his performance is probably reviewed by the media and Labour MEPs.
He demanded fewer theaters and more facts during this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip certain meetings in order to leave them to their colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns, because she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC-Annual Conference on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour Chairman's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the time of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75 th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of tory-MPs, and in the focus of several of the front pages of the newspapers.
Mr Corbett's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention to himself.
A spokesman of Mr Corbyn said that he would have admitted himself in respectable silence, and he acknowledged the Royal Air Force's own heroism in the air raid on England.
But a member of Mr Corbyns Shadow kabinett, Owen Smith, told the BBC two news, and he advised Labour leader to sing the national anthem, independent of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns's top team, and they are calling for economic, defence and foreign policy differences, when less than one of the six of the parliamentary party initially supported it as a leader.
The Political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also in the hands of Labour, according to Mr Corbett's words, on the position of the European Union and on limit.
Mr Corbyn said to the TUC conference that Labour intend to remove the whole idea of a limit.
Some hours later, Mr Smith, the Shadow Working Group, said that the party was very clear, that it was only against government plans, and that it would reduce the limit of £26,000 million to £23000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader, David Cameron, who is David Cameron, the leader of David Cameron, the last decade of what is in Parliament over the paper box in Parliament.
The Labour Chair, who has promised another policy approach, is saying that he has given a question of raising charges for questions to Mr Cameron for questions to Mr Cameron and giving him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is confrontational, and that he will refrain from exercising both skill in terms of effort, and the strike with points of action, and has instead focused on focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of the economic minister, will be represented by him if he is not taking part, for example, if Mr Cameron is on the move abroad.
He also initiated the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the floor, and that he addressed John Bercow, the spokesman of the House, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a model that was often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but that a few years later, he acknowledged that he failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was viewed as the main barometer of a leader's ruling and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his colleagues, when critics argued that it has become a caricature, and requires far-reaching reforms.
Shooting in Joburg: Homeless people are trained for photographers.
The centre of Johannesburg is a tough place to stay homeless.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
What happened in Joburg in Joburg is a non-profit studio that teaches young people how to take photos from their surroundings and make a profit out of them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Sterling is rising by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound has skyrocketed according to data that show a rise in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 has been increased by the SABMiller target.
Between May and July, earnings in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
Since 2009, this percentage has been the fastest and most accurate assessments of the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505, and up to 0.84% of the euro rose to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was one of the outstanding shares on the market and made a leap of 20% after an acquisition offer by rival AB In-Play was received.
A transaction would combine the two biggest breweries in the world, bringing together brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry-equities were 0.9% higher than encouraging news from the competing group of luxury goods.
The latest sales figures show all expectations and also show that the sales in China - a key market for Burberry - logs up to growth.
The shares of Glencore rose by 5% after Bergbauriese said that it had taken 2.5 billion dollars ($2.5 billion in equity) as part of its strategy of debt reduction.
The shares of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had put its assessment for the company rating on sale on sale.
JD Sports rose by 3.1% when the sports bond company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the six months.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion.
The CEO of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in potential customers" bags.
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the increased labor costs of his company, so he says.
The costs could involve the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, megastar.
Lent 21 years of young, a hangar with a top.
The type with the platinblonden hair is 100 million euro hard.
Even more so.
At present Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation is U17.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard of the name that we have heard about it.
Not worse.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7am in the morning, the Polin has been sitting on the top of the top of the top of the top of Berlin on the top of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: This is where her idol, whose poster is attached to Szczecin, has been on stage since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs the same on the day as her Mama Ewa deserves in half a year.
If anything.
What says: Actually, my Viktoria would have to sit in the tenth class in the high school.
I give her a dream of a dream.
Duty of debt?
What on earth is it?
The fans do not.
Also bending itself does not.
They have borrowed anyway.
For the promotion in the advertising break of the supertank he put three million, a two-year deal with an anti-picker company flush of many, many dollars in the bending account.
And with each doll that looks like it and over the counter, bending bending also is.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, it is amazing when it comes to the window.
He has captured more than 100 million in this way.
Tell Manche that the hype goes too far.
Others emphasize that bending pressures are in the United States and Great Britain with its new single What do you do in place 1.
Bending itself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, doesn't interest the zeros first.
At least he is doing so.
Pegida brings together Lebanese and the potato döner idea.
Potatoes or Döner?
ES is going on both - and in the potato döner, which has been developed by the Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying, potato potato instead of Döner added on a poster of the Pegida-movement Alhay potato and meat together on a brick.
On the idea, a poster brought him to a Pegida-demonstration with the inscription of potatoes instead of Döner, which he was accidentally seen on television.
In his store, Seitdem has a barbecue that is filled with meat and potatoes.
What makes it possible for the stomach to come, Alhay is believed to be one of the most beautiful of all.
The idea has now been given to the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility.
So, how much meat contains and how much potato contains, Alhay does not want to be betrayed.
There is nothing less than that: What tastes together is better than that which is better.
It is also good for its clients to understand international understanding of nations.
Metcash launches a campaign to control the fight against alopecia.
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Wholesale trader Metcash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to an 700 million USD Aldi-Invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA-supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand via mainstream marketing and marketing via social media as well as events like AdelaideShow.
IGA-dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like Eishmanufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who is distributing in IGA shops and selling store owners who sell approved tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of his defense strategy on 29 September, if the wholesale trader for food, alcohol and equipment carries out his annual investment strategy.
ES is at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA-Ladenhandel and generate higher margins than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
EInkbuyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorious, and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24% in Western Australia, compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that, 12 months after the opening of its first markets, around 5% of the food market will be removed from these two countries, and that all existing actors, but mainly independent retailers, will take away sales.
According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose 360 million of revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 next year in WA and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantity on Metcashs of a high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about EUR 13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly on Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA purchasers are the most.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash's sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8% in 2016, a 4.1 percent in 2017, and 2.1% in 2018, reducing the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager, Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told us that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade during a business lunch that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Douglass.
However, it is assumed that a director of Metcash has contacted Mr Douglass last week.
Since 2010, iGAS market share has fallen from 18% to 14 percent, and income from Metcash's food and food store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reduction at the same time as pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesale dealer trusts and invests more than $150 million to bring sales prices to Coles and Woolworths into hundreds of products per week, and to improve their stores by improving their shops with rapidly growing fresh food, and providing a better choice of private-Lile foods.
Metcash Chief Executive Officer Ian Morrice says it is hoped that the price adjustments and the shop adjustment programmes will be launched on Elan and hopes that, for the first time in four years, the wholesale trader will return to a return to profit for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis Association Steve Healy.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the most popular collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and deserves praise in the opinion of the president of Australian tennis association Steve Healy as a criticism of his own conduct.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is repeatedly known as a Special Ks, came under the spotlight of Montreal Masters as a result of the infamous dispute with Stan Gios with Stan Wafalka.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon afterwards, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison having to beat Kyrgyzstan, and I should beat the child.
While he last saw how he crushed a tennis racquet after a Krampf froze a potential US Open-Sieg by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth around the second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup-semi-finals against Great Britain.
A thing about which I am rather adventurous is the fact that in my view Thanasi has been drawn into the dispute, he said Healy said.
He broke a racquet when he lost in the US Open because of a racket, but he is not the first player to have broken a racquet from frustration to himself, and I know Thanasi is good enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, indeed, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much credit.
He has a great team around himself, he has a great family around himself, and I think he has been treated somewhat too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old who is working very hard, and he fits to the team and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is still respected in the changing area, he is trained hard, he is trained hard, he is good in form, he is
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgyzstan on the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, which begins on Friday and describes the joint decision to be taken as the right one for everyone, but it secures the man in Canberra to return to the team as a long-term component of the team.
First of all, we would like the team to concentrate entirely on competition and not to focus on all the controversies surrounding the process of a situation that surrounds it, namely that which said Healy said.
If you want to know what is going to happen, you might want to know what is going to happen.
Europe's crisis of refugees: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, withdraws refugees back.
Hungary declares the state of emergency and denounced the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, holding all that attempted to enter the country illegally, with the aim of putting an end to the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed on the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's-land and responded to Serbian officials.
The people who had fled violence set aside for unknown age in a land strip on the road between the two countries" control points, and settled there.
But frustrations have increased.
When a police helicopter ran over them, migrants opened the border, and shouted against the Hungarian on-call police force.
Some fields back out of protest of food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister declared that it is unacceptable that migrants should be returned from Hungary, while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia, Serbia, wants to be part of the solution rather than collateral damage.
ES must take place in the coming days with talks with Brussels and other countries, said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border failed to reach a common immigration policy on a day after the 28-national bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the overrun of Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that, by the end of the year or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would include further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not place its hopes on an early action from Brussels or from its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more power to deal with the crisis so that they could close roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire along its border with Romania in order to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence along the Serbian border.
CBS news correspondent Charlie Agata reported that even prison inmates were used during the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming economic migrants who are seeking a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, cross the border or the shameful of the 4-meter to a crime that the government created along the southern border with Serbia, and establish higher prison sentences for the people who have been sentenced to death.
With regard to the situation that has arisen as a result of mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares the state of emergency to the state of emergency, saying government spokeswoman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
We say it is very clear: Illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament still needs to agree to the military use of the military who is expected next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen on the border of hard-won soldiers with vehicles for days to come.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Lands-security adviser for Orban, said that the authorities have penetrated 45 people when trying to cross the border, while 15 others have entered the country deeper.
They come from by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and they are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a train wagon with barbed wire to close the borders.
Chaos replaced the most important crossing of the border near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to work on the data of people and press a crowd of people to cover themselves.
About 20 have managed to reach it, but thousands have remained outside it.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they would refuse food and water until they can enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead before Bernie Sanders in national survey
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins it from the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47% of democratic voters in pre-election, while Sanders is in second place, with a 27% increase by 17 percent.
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency, receives support for 15% of the Democratic electorate of pre-election.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they believe they will support them.
But Clinton's supporters in their election are more consistent than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won some profits.
Clinton holds a great advantage among women and moderates, but these precipitations have narrowed.
Your support for men has fallen sharply, and Sanders is only 5 points back.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
But Clinton has a big advantage among the elderly.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Bush with a second advantage with the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage with this group.
About half of the country's democratic voters nationwide say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some, and they would support another 15% because they are the candidate.
They would not support them 6%.
Perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it.
The views are more mixed among those who do not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them.
While 48% of democratic voters in the pre-election campaign say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate, Donald Trump, which is 35 percent.
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience has a 16 percent term, followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is going to be 13 percent of the job, and that she is the best candidate for the job is 10 percent
His connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned by Clinton's supporters.
Agreement on how to deal with the problems is also cited.
As the Vice-President throws up a potential for the presidency of the presidency, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-election want to see him in the race, although a third believes he should not do so.
If democratic voters in pre-election are asked who is their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton's followers argue that Biden would be far before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to stand for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton will take advantage in front of Sanders, from 20 points with Biden to 30 points without him in race.
Twenty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning, but this figure has fallen from 78% to last month.
Biden is by far the second to measure this measure, but the percentage that it considers to be the most suitable has increased.
Nevertheless, when it comes to what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about eligibility.
Just like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands as unacceptable for these voters in pre-election.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results on a number of key features when it comes to voters of their party.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, trustworthy, and with strong leadership.
Biden performs best among the three candidates in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many of them say 15% of the figure is 15%, but 27 percent do not believe in it.
Democratic voters in pre-election generally view Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
With all of these measurements, one quarter of the democratic electorate has no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server remain as Secretary of State as Secretary of State as Secretary of State, most of the Democratic electorate of the pre-election campaign are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their views as a whole.
But it is another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one third is happy.
Public opinion was divided in March when the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the email dispute had no impact on Clinton's overall opinion, even though 36% said that their opinion has deteriorated.
ES are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that their Clinton views have become worse.
Though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by voters in her party, this is still a problem for them among voters in general: Only 32% view them as honest and trustworthy, 8% less than in last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of the electorate do not believe they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters also see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good marks with leadership.
Biden, Carson, and Bush best cut off from the six candidates who have been tested.
A majority is more likely than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves close to Donald Trump in a poll that is close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson stands behind Donald Trump with the latest poll of CBS News New York Times behind Donald Trump.
The two candidates now account for half of the voters" support in the new poll, and others lose out dramatically.
Republican electorates continue to support Trump across the country in large numbers, and support is growing by 23% in the last CBS-survey that was held before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in Tuesday's poll.
But Carson Schoss reached 23% in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson is good for demographic groups and that Trump exceeds Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Argentine Governor John Kasich, was cut off with Wiscone's governor, Scott Walker, who fell in love with 10% support last month to 2%.
The former Florida-governor Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida-Senator Marco Rubio, is with 6% on the third place.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6%, and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN article, published last week, shows that Carson is growing in the polls - he joins 19% support for the Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest poll by ABC News by Washington Post also showed Trump in front of Carson.
With a view of a Carson who grew up last week, Trump found some side shows for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trumps faith.
When we need energy, Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Even if top values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean will be enough for those who are looking for warm water to come.
At a maximum of 17 degrees, a bath in the North or the Baltic will be a short pleasure.
Mancher is no longer going to go into the sea: A maximum of 18 degrees has water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, dividing the German weather service DWD used.
On the other hand, bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: In the east it is up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic, it is 25 degrees at the top, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a barmaid
Almost two years after having passed a student during a bullying ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five persons.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta Brotherhood attacked Chun, Michael, during an introductory session in September 2013, and postponed his transport to the hospital which contributed to his death, sharing the police.
Officials said that he had been burdened with a 30-pound lap full of sand, and he was repeatedly attacked while he tried to reach a target by means of a frozen field.
After all, Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they brought it to a hospital.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, their symptoms, and Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, to contact the council, and police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
Working on this point, members began to hide Utensilien, and in principle the prosperity of the Brotherhood arose above that of Michael Deng, said police chief Wagner.
He could not be resurrected, and he died on his injuries the next morning.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly aggrieved with blunt force of injury to the head, hull, and thighs.
At least one student since 1970 dies of harassment every year, said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family in a statement.
Bruises and their members must be brought to justice, and this is a very important step by authorities.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge for the murder of third degrees for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of harassment and the formation of a criminal association.
We not only want to make people responsible for the people involved, but if there is an organisation that - official or unofficial - this has sanctioned this, so we will also be able to hold them accountable, said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its membership with the local group.
That will happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
Interest rates rise, and domestic goods will falter, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know this.
What we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will be.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first increase in interest rates, and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, albeit not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
This is why representatives of the US central bank have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start to increase interest rates, rather than extending it to the period that is needed for normalization.
Indeed, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the excitement of raising interest rates might have been exaggerated.
America's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money to be interpreted, said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still at low levels, in order to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here, a glimpse of historical trends is based on how certain sectors of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, it is possible to make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
It seems that there seems to be a tendency that 12 to 24 months after the first increase, what perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy, German bank analysts say that it is a recent study, and this is what is happening after the Fed's rate hikes.
To be more precise, the market is mostly in the upward trend of about 14 percent in the last 35 years - about 14 percent on the road to interest rate increase, fairly flat in the 250 days after that average profit of 2.6 percent is then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six months of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis that Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on equities tends to occur later in the cycle of increase, and that the yield begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rates often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that were not previously and which could accelerate a recession.
What is most remarkable is that GDP will be near its lowest point in the Fed's rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal GDP since 1950 has been less than 4.5 percent of nominal GDP since 1950.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect this to last and expect only 1.5% for the third quarter of the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic background could be risky, and throw out the question of whether it is different this time, said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken an interest rate hike in the Fed all year, and all eyes were addressed to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only gives a probability of 25%.
In our study, all the growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP, and very soon after the beginning of recovery in the shadows, as described in the report.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, because the market pretends interest rates, and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than in the case of equities if they change their strategic course.
With bonds, returns seem to shift direction as soon as the first increase is achieved in the cycle.
At the end of the increase, bond yields fall immediately, and Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to more than the rate of returns between longer and shorter bonds.
High-income bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, though we are still wary of receiving higher yields, said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst with Schwab, in an analysis.
What is interesting is that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
The strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy, it wrote it.
Short term interest rates have increased, the yield curve has become flat, credit buffs have expanded, and volatility has increased - all of the market's characteristics is that the Fed is tightening its strategy.
In general, companies that handle most of their business in the US will benefit from raising interest rates and making local products more attractive.
Multinationals with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, as do the financing of their debts.
History History shows that quality in quality tends to respond three months after an initial increase in interest rates, Goldman Sachs analysts commented on a report for clients.
Companies with a strong balance have surpassed companies with weak results after each of the rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their equity also surpassed their low quality counterparts on average 4% in size, and 3 percentage points on average.
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most, said Goldman.
Consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar outside pure equity stakes.
Savers could see profits through higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the classic FM, says, MP, Andrew Bingham.
The Conservative Member of Parliament has criticized the station for his/she was the subject of his/
He argues that he is increasingly different from commercial rivals.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitate The Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice, and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 converts itself to Classic FM, claims to be a leading Member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he is doing something that the private sender does not do.
The Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC Bossen that public service radio station is more likely to be different from that of commercial competitors and increasingly out of commercial competitors.
Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word to change the word - but it seems to be turned into Classic FM, he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards which took place last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, only appear to be under a different name to The Brits.
So, if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you only imitate what is already on the market, Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director-General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is ahead of his commercial rivals when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music making that is really unsurpassed.
Design And the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on order is also really important for important, he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it was necessary to work harder to get the audience involved when it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport to put commercial rivals on their feet.
The Torah MEP Damien Collins contacted The Voice, the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed, because it is not original and it is not particularly significant?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and George George as a judge - was produced in special BBC mode.
He added that he would like the company to find a hit out of our own stable when it is the next time it starts a series of entertainment.
However, he refused to exclude the order of other ranks of The Voice in the future, or to spend money of fees for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales grew at the slowest in August, and Black Friday can be responsible for this.
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since records began in 2000.
Online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slowed down expenditure.
For over a decade, virtual shopping has fallen, and many of Britain's major shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts tell us that there are now signs that online sales will stagnate as new figures show only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August represented the lowest growth in growth since the start of the record in 2000, with only five percent increase compared with the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating as new figures display only 7% of growth in the first three months of 2015.
When you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then this has evolved over time, saying Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified as buyers three years ago to make purchases with their mobile phones.
ES meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments.
But this now oscillates, and we will probably see growth reduced.
The black-friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for subsequent sales.
Experts believe that buyers reserve their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, on five times, the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers were fighting for bargains, might discourage buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that £5 £was spent online.
With some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now being made via web shops.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of buying in the city centres in the fashion chains.
Muslims are buried in Mecca during the accident of the crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned.
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca by the streets.
Saudi Arabia places part of the collapse of part of the huge Saubian Bin-Ladens Group on Last
The Ministry of Health said that 394 people were also injured when the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims congregated when 29 of the victims were driven by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed on the island of Mekkas.
Mourning filled, largely dressed in white, the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead entered their last trip to the Al-Moaisseman cemetery.
The marriage procession passed over to the Sanctuary, where only days ago a tree crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the finishing.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on Bin Laden's construction company because of the catastrophe which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great central mozhee Mekka have been carried by the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the Kran supported.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddle in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly stated that the Haddsch will continue with thousands of people who will continue to come to Mecca.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden-Group should not have been the whole of the crane when he was not being used.
An Arab version of the decree that was published by the state's Saudi Press Agency, said that the binder group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but it said that the tour of the company are prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the great mosquitos, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsch, who later took place this month.
The Bin-Laden-Group has issued no statements on the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The king decree also baptized the group because of non-current security measures, and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mekka Großmozhee as part of the massive construction project run by the Bin-Laden-Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over larger building projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crane's crash came in the midst of strong winds and rain, only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million Rials £174,000 should be paid to the relatives of the dead and that the same amount would be permanently injured.
Other injured receive half of this amount.
B & Q Boss says that the time of the cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased behind it.
This leads to 200 more screen stores aimed at craftsmen who will open them.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets throughout the country.
By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
ES is claimed that Britons place their hammers and brushes in favour of using qualified East European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes.
If you can handle walls with a hammer or a brush, you seem to belong to a minority today.
For Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out home jobs in their homes, leaving the company behind B & Q
Véronique Laury, the new manager of Kingfisher, who owns the nurseries, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has now been overtaken by services at rock-bottom prices.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix shops, which are aimed at craftsmen and 60 sales outlets of B & Q
Mrs Laury said she wants more women in B & Q, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are taken by women.
At present, men predominate among employees.
She said it is necessary to rise to the growing demographic trends that have more female households that make more renovation than in the past.
Mrs Laury said It still works a majority of men in our stores.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
As a matter of principle, half of our clients comprise 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of goods by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of five of the leading companies to be listed by only five women in the FTSE100 index, has also reworked with her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in management positions.
Kingfisher is the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its Board of Management.
Mrs Laury said this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
ES was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in semi-annual earnings and sales after the group bore the cost of closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B & Q have 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich Bold DOB on the basis of infidelity to court
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Party will have to answer on Wednesday of two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Party.
The people who were accused are not guilty of this.
One of them was also charged with abuse of authority.
From this allegation, he was legally acquitted in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to the Attorney General, Robert Riffel showed that, in the years from 2006 to 2011, the accused were using money of club accounts about which they were allowed to deal with their functions for private purposes.
It is estimated that it is estimated to be about 400,000 Euros.
Sport officials are also charged with financial offences.
This fact has left the president of the bartender, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
In order to move the unfaithful, the defence was that at no time it was an asset that was lost to the club.
Sport officials would only have had to charge the cost of expenses and the sports club for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011, and they would have invested a lot of time and money from paying off debts.
At that time, we were faced with the situation: Let us carry on and close the club, and one of the defendants, one of the people accused, told us what is going to happen in the production of bread.
He then decided to carry out this task with his colleague and co-accused.
With all the risks.
When we put money before us, our life insurance policy as the security of the bank was won, he said when he was taken.
It has been agreed with the Association: You can manage the money freely, it is impossible to make any debts.
Furthermore - in case of financial success - the disbursement of expenses has been agreed retrospectively until 1991.
That is why we have paid out part of the allowances years later, namely from 2003, when a plus was on the account.
This is why the former Obmann explained what was going to happen, so the former Obmann explained what was going on.
The accounts and savings books were jointly administered by the two defendants, the second defendant said.
Why no payments had been disclosed to the club in detail, the judge asked.
The Association did not care about the details of financial sponsorship, it was only important to have the freedom of debt, so the answer was.
When an investigation began in 2011 against one of the officials responsible for abuse of office, a sum of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
They were reserves, and they declared the accused.
This securities account was based on the name of the second defendant and was not known according to what the club was saying.
Why do you want to know what to do?
This was something he did not know about for a long time.
Then, after all, he thought he believed that this was the best for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything of this money, putting the Public Prosecutor in the room.
The co-accused would have been informed, and this was the right thing to do.
This bank transfer was formulated as a claim for damage recovery.
Why do judges and public prosecutors want to know?
The first sentence stated that he was not in favour of this formulation because the club had never been damaged.
But what can I do if the lawyer says?
When I became a legal representative, he asked what he was going to do.
He also said that he had never paid a cent of salary, using only mileage and diets.
On diets, he charged EUR 1,000 per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Exact documents for the early years could not be seen by the accused.
They were no longer kept after an operation check in which everything had been judged correctly, and they declared.
It was also the second person who was accused of kilometers.
All of them are in cash in cash, he has to drive from his place of residence to the Bank to Bleiburg, and he explained in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard Discounts 30 000 jobs
In addition to the workforce reduction which has been going on for three years, the computer riese will reduce jobs when the company split up.
The footprint of the US computer giant, Hewlett-Packard, for HP is not an end.
Within the framework of its restructuring, the US technology group is planning to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its business clients.
As a result of this, the company was expected to save costs to the tune of €2.7 billion, which was saved on Tuesday by the company on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars, which will accrue from the fourth quarter.
The ongoing decline in 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed.
At the end of fiscal 2013, HP employed around 302,000 employees at the end of 2013.
On average, the Hewlett-Packard stock gave 2.3 percent.
The company with printers from California Palo Alto is currently dividing itself up: This is how the computer and printer business is to be bundled together this year in a new company - separately from the more future-oriented areas with computer servers and data stores for companies and other services.
Both business segments are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A again disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate clients for its services enabled Lenovo to make the most of the world's second largest PC manufacturer.
In the third quarter at the end of July the sales of computers and printers dropped by 11.1 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.4 billion.
As a result, the proceeds dropped to 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP answers with a split and massive footprint on change in the industry.
The 76 years old company, led by Meg Whitman, only responded late when customers buy smartphones and tablets rather than conventional computers and do more online.
Altogether, Whitman's restructuring plans will see the dismantling of around 55,000 posts.
Conflicts: Majority supports the anti-trust mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would be overwhelmingly opposed: 54 per cent of languages are opposed to 35%.
The fact that other states are flying air strikes against the state in Iraq and in syria is positive.
24 percent is against intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with the Syrian ruler, Bashar al-Assad, is opposed to 51% of respondents, 20 per cent would be in favour.
29 percent was unable to take a decision.
Auto: Second press day on the 66 th IAA.
At the heart of the trade fair are networked, self-driving cars as well as electromobility.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will open the 66 international automotive exhibition under the banner of mobility by means of official opening on Thursday.
The large public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the Auto Association VDA expect to see about 900 000 visitors with about 900 000 visitors two years ago.
The Röszke: The outbreak of violence on the border of Serbia and Hungary
The Hungarian police have worked on the Serbian border with Röszke Tränengas and water cannons against several hundred displaced people.
Euronews correspondent, Dániel Bozsik, has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
There was a police line behind it, and there was a water cannon behind the police.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles to officials.
The officers first replaced Pfefferspray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas has been sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
That is what the group has dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn something.
A pregnant woman and obviously an injured woman was taken away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees caught up in themselves and suffered respiratory failure.
Also the pressesprecher of the Serb police suffered injury through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of a decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve is meeting on Wednesday and Thursday to take the important decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey among 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters found that a little over half, which was still last week that the Fed would do, is that the Fed is now thinking that the Fed will remain stuck a bit longer, and that interest rates will remain at zero - 0.25% at present.
ES is a historic event because it is seven years since the Fed fixed NULL.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank might leave zero, and a process of normalisation of interest rates is beginning to start, said Angel Ubide, the manager of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good track, and trillions of dollars are added to balance sheet, only generating low inflation.
However, the Fed is unable to ignore the less rosy outlook of global circumstances.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but signs suggest that the chances of such a move are good.
The decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday.
Death Protection at Delta State University left behind debt relief
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleague on the day on the day, and killed - Shannon Lamb wrote a note in order to say that it was tired of doing it to the first murder of the first murder and wanted to make it impossible for him to announce that public authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer in geography and social science education at the Delta State University, and the emergency number called 10: 00 on Monday morning
And he said he was shot on someone who killed someone.
One of them said to the employee that the police would have to send policemen to their homes.
He said I shot up my wife last night, and he also mentioned that a swedish dog is in the house, but that no one will disturb anyone, but it is likely to be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
There was no explanation for his shots.
As the police the scene praying, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note by Lamb, 45 who said: To Me I do so sorry, I wanted me to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he took his own life on Monday evening, a policeman.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but of course there was something in Mr Lambs.
Despite reports on Monday, which Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was no information, there was no proof that there was a triangular triangular relationship.
Prentiss was married to Shawn by Shawn, saying that she was married about seven years when a good human being described him.
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
He said, he and Prentiss would have a daughter who is 19, and she was destroyed on the ground.
He said that Prentiss, her daughter, were absolutely best friends.
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who possessed a dog named Lightning, has met with lamb for about three years.
When you wanted to help other people, said Knowles
The police said Lamb called relatives at a particular time on Monday to tell them that he does not go to prison.
As a police officer on Highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled to foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, the Delta State University received a PhD from the Delta State University, as his life in life indicates on the University's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky winners
The actor who left his left, in the picture with his son Redmond's right to the right, had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor is alleged to be fighting with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this is certainly taking its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is building the Group around it
Lufthansa plans to construct a large corporate structure.
Half a billion Euros per year will save the Lufthansa Group by means of better organisation.
150 of the world's around 1000 executives will be able to take up their jobs at work.
With the pilot trade union, however, there are new negotiations.
Lufthansa is expanding its business structure and is evaluating Eurowings's low-budget airlines.
The target of realignment is an earnings contribution of about EUR 500 million per year out of cost and replacement synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a Board of Management for the passenger business.
The budget line of Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the future Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings.
With the new record, Spohr highlights the importance of Eurowings with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organisation of the 120 000 employee has been complex.
The airline acted under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of €30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the case of the collective bargaining agreement with the pilot association, Cockpit, VC, negotiations are to be resumed after the strike on Thursday on this Thursday.
That was what the trade union did.
The theme of the talks is intended to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit intended in one year with a projected record result to achieve lasting results as soon as possible.
The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of pilots, the concept of saving is a matter of course.
It states that in the fight against competitors, Lufthansa is outsourced to Eurowings on its own low-cost line.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months on the basis of double fracture.
Luke Shaw, who suffered a double fracture of his right leg, suffered a double fracture of his right leg when he won the Champions League defeat from Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left outside of the world and excludes it for at least six months from playing, Louis van Gaal does not hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15 minute, after the 20-year-old Shaw had fallen into the PSV area.
He was treated to the playing field for nine minutes, and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital.
He will be moved tomorrow, or perhaps a day later, in Manchester.
ES is awful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, has a very hard time, and then plays fantastic, happens, and then it happens.
In the dressing room it had an oxygen mask.
He has been crying out.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double question, it will take six months and it will not be in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a Red Map and the imposition of an Elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, has not punished the Mexicans.
He believed that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge by yourself when I say that an Elfmeter and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack on both legs.
A Tweet was on Shaws's account: I thank you all for your messages, and words can't describe how I broke, my way to heal starts now, I come back again.
This is where I am referring: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw during the defeat of the PSV
The England-defender has an additional incentive to catch up with the Euro in France to catch up until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said it is a very bad injury.
If a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, everyone is very sad.
ES is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg when Mexico played against Van Gaals during the 2014 World Cup.
It is very difficult because it was not his intention to injure the enemy, and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury, that is not good, Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I was able to see was the ball that was on the road in a different direction, so it looked as if he had touched him with a score of Moreno, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno: I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad, I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a fan play by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
ES is one thing that all parents learn soon: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it by heart.
Be it because you are probably David Cameron.
When he was asked to name his favorite pedigree by a provider of childcare systems, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, who published the environmental impact of Dr. Seuss in 1971.
ES was a difficult election, Cameron wrote in a message on the site of the company Supercamps, and continues: Fun, moving, creative, with a powerful message, it is a book I like to read to my children because it always seems to be an image or a message we have missed so far.
Everything is fine and good, except that the next paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead a summary of the film version of 2012 which added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text.
In the midst of the still-walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hoping to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by reading her wish to see a real tree, reading a love interest Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage, died in
As if this is not yet suspect, the text presented by Cameron reads like the summary of the record of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database, and so begins: A boy named Ted called Ted, the heart of Audrey, to win the hearts of Audrey, the girl of his dreams.
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR effort was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times after a child.
A Downing-Street-spokesperson said that the text was probably reached by Cameron's constituency office.
Supercamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but there were no further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England's team, but it is still hard to do so.
It is a difficult task to meet on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, but if you see the Kader that England has chosen for the tour, there is no repeat of the 3-0 test defeat defeat on my card.
I would not rule out an upward trend.
Alastair Cooks's page may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spy players in the battle, and the community spirit is strong; they will bear no scars from 2012, only a youthful and positive setting.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developed as a Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
This: Adam Lyth SCHEIDET replaces and replaces Alex Hales with Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, for me, as his chief coach in Yorkshire, is hard to analyze.
With its seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are geared to results.
ES gave no question marks to Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination as - and I said earlier - players are their own best selections.
Long ago, the course of Lyth would have been extended, but it had control over its own destiny.
If I hope to see more runs for Yorkshire, there is another chance.
The Englishman coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position, even if he did not make so good performance, and this doesn't surprise me; he is first and foremost a team man.
The question of how much time a test stroke is given to set its sign is difficult.
Lyth gained seven chances like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only charge one can claim was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean as Lyth was at the highest, but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a drummer whom I admire greatly.
He is an X factor cricket player what we saw in Yorkshire early in this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as those received before him, but this depends, of course, on the team record in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of allowing Moeen alongside Cook, which would provide an extra spy Bowler and receive four points, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a drummer can't beat there, and this link has already shown that he is a vicious circle of crimp players.
Moeen might not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
My predecessor, Justin Langer, played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared in the Opener in 2001.
He did three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadres as a back up-spinner, and in my limited way of dealing with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People might see its statistics on average 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and think it is a punt, but there is no large number of backup spiders who collect their hands, and the trainers have chosen for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England has made a few clever additions to the trainer.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant to the test games could be a masterpiece.
He is one of the hottest guys of the game, which will bring a wealth of experience as he played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can take place in the changing room, even if the news is in line with what was said before.
Collys team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used for the One Dayers, Root got a similar break with Australia and for my part I have no problem with it.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team members do not determine the timetable.
And you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
The Brexite camp Brexit = exit from Great Britain of the EU could win at Zulwin if the economy got into a Flaute by the year 2017.
David Cameron's incomplete negotiation strategy to keep Britain present in the EU, every day David Cameron gets deeper into trouble, even without choosing the genius Jeremy is it is yes or no.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European secretary of diplomacy said recently that some Member States are so deeply involved in various crises as the EU is, as it is not always from their own fault, Britain's own agenda with split concessions and disruptive changes to the treaty that they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual assembly that it does not like it if it were to endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfi agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at summits or bilaterals in foreign capitals, make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, come home and say that they win allies for reform.
ES is always about me.
My European friend, who wants to see a United Kingdom who wants to see us sit inside the European Union - she does not like France alone with France - she says that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or whether we are going to go
German cautious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally, but she has been in power for 10 years, and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as it is with the excessively long proclamations like Thatcher 11 years, Mitterrand, 14 of Mitterrand and Kohl, 16 of what is going on.
France's François Hollande looks to his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
It is also a failure to act.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain one left.
It is hard to imagine that they will break a leg in order to help the Selfie-British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK, something, which they do not want because the most similar separatist tendencies do.
Therefore, it is possible that some of these ministers are even deliberately planning unhelpful notes, which is in the SNP-style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017 is expected to accelerate the Brex process.
The renegotiation was a bankruptcy, and Britain won nothing from the renegotiation of renegotiation.
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be to their cost, and what EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press is like they were during the 1975 referendum that supported our entry into 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
You can remember Boris Johnson, who has made a name for himself as an EU-led correspondent of Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
Ed militia knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of hard-headed rogue, telephone hacking, and the pseudo-non-Incas who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was similar to him, but it noted that if you are sitting in a cage with a hot Gorilla, you'll better distribute bananas so as not to become lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more to Blair than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's sect. Because Blair had the principle of the EU's not adopted constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which open to him to open a back door.
The press has never forgotten it.
But the good Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a kind of poppy on Monday at Westminster - I told him that he does not need time to spend more time on me - it seems to me that a mistake at the time of Neil Kinnock's boycott of the 80's strategy seems to be repeated.
ES may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC-Sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns is the official position of Europe - I press it on in a friendly way - it is in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Now, most of the people outside Ukips can say "yes."
ES is what Hilary makes a Benn, but no Bennite on Radio and Television said this week when the scout was fighting in him not to admit that Corbyn`s appointment of the provocative John McDonnell was a bad idea as a shadow Chancellor.
ES reminded me of the 70-years when his old father worked on television to be illoyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilard's struggle was still more attractive.
But to fight to keep up in all circumstances under all circumstances - Benns - what McDonnell said was not what McDonnell said, and what JC said to his colleagues after all the reports at their meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever it is that Corbyn Bottom-Up-image of Corbyn is about to convey - remember that he has even moved to me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock, and above all, in the Strudel of Social Media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
ES is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe, which allows him to keep labours in support in the referendum campaign as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks like this.
But McDonnell and Corbyns are no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, in line with their goal of anti-capitalist past, their anti-capitalist past, for which the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities with NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that JC is not going to launch a campaign in order to exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a point for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, they also have suspicious voters, in order to make concessions to the British if this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq, in Libya and in syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tor government in power, which I was reminded of what was called the British influenza Security Forum at the start of Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England's report on E-cigarettes
Allegations of a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking has been created from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links with the tobacco industry, researchers.
Experts who write to the British Medical Journal of BMJ joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England in its report on e-cigarettes.
He published the report on the theme of last month's statement, and describes it as a comprehensive review of the evidence.
But some researchers have questioned the resilience of data, focusing on the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
One editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month took advantage of the exceptionally windy basis on which Phe founded his most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims based on stone or sand build up.
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said that A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on effectiveness.
You said that the public expects that the claim of Phe that the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking is based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who have been convened to develop a model for a multipurpose decision analysis that is a multipurpose Decision Analysis - MCDA, in order to make their opinions about the damage to various nicotine products; the results of the meeting have been summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managers had previously received funds from British American Tobacco Products for an independent study.
He also wrote the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting declared that money should be obtained from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but it did not include the funding that it would have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International after reports have been reported.
The reasons for the selection of members of the panel will not be delivered, but this includes several well-known E-cigarette champions, some of which include industry funding in the paper.
A number of other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in the control of tobacco.
At the meeting the production of tobacco from Phe took part as well.
The research of the group tellingly admits that there is a lack of hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria, writing McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links is being discussed in the PHE-report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of Phe that there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a way to smoke for children or non-smokers were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at Phe, said that BMJ's claims already responded.
He said that electronic cigarettes are much less damaging than smoking.
Every second lifelong smoker is dying of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
Phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what is proved and what does not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health Service £2 billion per year.
By demonstrating clearly that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but that only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking is, we meet our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former chief of Channel 4
The former chair of Channel 4, Luke Johnson said that the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals would give their right arm to their right arm for Hit-Sshows like the Albert Square of Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UKIP.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in a highly disputed window of time against the most popular shows of their rivals and of broadcasters like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he tried to contact Channel 4 for six years without success to get in contact with the BBC.
I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are being commissioned or that it clearly would be demonstrated by unsubsidized rivals, Johnson said to the Oberhaus-Communication Committee as part of his inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium term or in the long term, then it should be produced at least in programmes that others do not make or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class window because they want to offer as broad support as possible for their future.
The idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said I do not see why a regressive tax is being financed, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.
Of course, other channels would give their right arm to other channels.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public service television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for the series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the hunt for ratings because of the aspirations of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support.
Seine's comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts include what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, proposed in his MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-service niche programs should go to BBC4, where they do not measure their tasks, and they can argue that if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify $4 billion, Now, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen.
They place them in a window of time in which nobody ever wanted to see.
On broadcasting, Johnson said to the committee: I invite you to find a rather regressive system on terms of who can receive the best value from this.
Of course, you all think we all think you have a great deal for £150 a year, but for people who spend a lot of money for the £150 £, I wonder if this is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who was also told before the committee on Tuesday, claimed that the BBC should check its Babylan-mission, inform, make up and talk about it.
He said that little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it is 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and that it should take an example of public service television stations in Australia and Canada.
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pros whom he said only a handful on television will be shown, engaging in alliances with commercial broadcasters in order to make everything available online.
It is possible to control brain cells by means of sound waves.
The video shows how the Nematodes change direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have high frequencies for human hearing.
The momentum is based on the use of Motoneuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Secondly, on this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light.
The researchers told us that the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that the procedure could someday replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that releases electric impulses into the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fadenworms generally do not react on ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, it found, amplify the ultrasound waves that then enter the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic shafts work on structures that are called TRP-4-axis channels and in the membranes of some of the wordy cells.
Sound waves increase the opening of these iteration channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned.
In order to produce ultrasound controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of its motoneurons carry 4-axis channels.
When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures, the waves of sound are reinforced by microwaves and transmitted to the worms where they can turn on the modified engine.
The procedure has a number of similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light, which has to be sent down to the brain by optical fibre, low-frequency ultrasonic shafts can circulate freely and be able to be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments, Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right at your doorstep!
Deceiving Britain's Arms Trade
Amnesty International Anti-Arms Translated to Video Video.
I would like to say that this is a threat to terror.
A combination of fools wraps fools!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock, which causes painful pain, but does not leave a trace!
The Fröhliche voice and the cartoon pictures give no doubt that this ad for the world's largest weapon fair, which is a combative parody that has been produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the UK's government into the spotlight to bring arms to the repressive regimes of Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.
Relative: DSEi weapon trade fair - Authoritarian regimes are going to stream to London.
But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway lines and require a second glance.
If you have any questions, please contact the London Underground for details of what is going to happen.
In September, a shelling of weapons dealers with DLR will be asked to help customers to stop the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are exhibited by artists who have exhibited their work in the museum of cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective with the name Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used ad space hack packs, a £6 £of Inbus Keys, which claims that access to about one third of the bus stations on the planet of Erlangen has been claimed.
Transport for London does not fun this poster of vandalism.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, Curator of Crueol Designs and Lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to work to the public outside galleries.
Many artists engage with activists in protest movements and notice that they must go outside into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapon handel-posters will greet the commuter in the metro.
The Amnesty Video has been viewed more than 100,000 times over 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works free with the graphic designer and voiceover artist who also works free of charge.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the arms trade fair: We give them the campaign to avoid them.
They played with the invention of a more realistic company advertising that is more realistic, but thanks to the infusion of bright colors and animation, it remains stronger.
You've done a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal follicles on the fair, says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors will release fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order by the United States Army over the back of AT4CS RS, which has been cut off from the shoulder.

Eight golden rules for life in student residences
Eleven years ago, I moved as a self-forgotten 19-year-old in a student residence, and still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but now I remember the tense smiles of those whom I irritated - and the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The residence in student residences ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely terrifying.
ES is tempting to talk to: People tell where you come from where you are going, where you have taken Sabbath, where you are with Corbyn, and why you do not love Marmite honestly.
Forgive me for that.
And help others to do the same - post questions and show interest.
ES directs the conversation and helps you to discover the people you like, contrary to whom you would not speak, even if your eyelashes came into fire and these fire extinguishers would be.
Let people be made public.
People's rooms are often transformed into beverage memories, film nights, and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people are dressed up and subduing their underwear.
This is what you were referring to: Do not remember to start with a relationship at university.
Introverted receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many of the student residences are room for room for space, which is friendly and sociable and can lead to a lasting friendship.
This can be the hell for someone who is trying to catch up.
Nothing in culture allows you to tell you that I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave, so I receive the energy I used to interact with you.
Try to feel when a commilitone is exhausted by conviviality - and send it to send an SMS.
Talk about apropos: Do it.
A guy in my student residences had the idea that a closed door was an invitation.
He saw a number of things.
Friendship ends by baking it.
Since you start the university at the climax of the baking mania, the flops on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brownies, less strange than the welcome of the 1950-years welcome in the neighborhood, I have baked you something, and now please smile when I pose a few personal questions.
Offering fools is a good way to make friends.
Your fellow residents feel bound to talk and will eventually associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly missing clumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, the claws of chicken is a theft, but is it a drop of a drop in your tea?
Look at this with the owner of the dairy.
The opportunities are good that they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside them.
If someone steals your things, it is annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it better than my fellow who added its milk to punish thieves.
It is now in prison.
They should make no noise, people from sleep or from work.
It is not just a question of being a decent person, but you literally belong to the people who are sitting in the glasshouse.
A girl on my floor asked her neighbors whether it is something they could do: It is three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded to the music that was still alive.
When they finally heard at 5 p.m., they kindly let their neighbors sleep another two hours before they plundered their own music, shut down their doors, and came to pass for their three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse were to be taken to the same student residence?
On the other hand, it would be embarrassing if you think it is too embarrassing for you to take a home for your future spouses, separate them from them, and then see how they can come up with all the common friends?
Of course, it is the heart that goes hand in hand - but if a hot fellow definitely is not your future spouse, try at least to say a little bit of reason.
At the very exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his key in his unlocked room, the border between Ulk and Mobbing is more fine than it seems.
A good stone is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Give you a valuable and amusing lesson about security, but never mind yourself dreaming of one of the rooms with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and place your key in a glass of water that you then put into the freezer - but you can no longer define your property on the ceiling more than it is twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the middle Franconian corner of terraced houses for people who do not have much money.
So for refugees, but also as a signal: Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low earners.
I show how to build cheap and well built today, the 44-year-old says in the interview.
Thousands of refugees will push for the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly it can be created: He builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push for the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or gyms does not have sustainability.
Because people remain here to a large extent.
In view of the influx of refugees, we also need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Guild: A terraced house needs least of space.
ES facilitates integration.
This is different if people are put in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each four asylum seeker.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
ES may be that many refugees will say it is again peace, I go back.
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs.
What are the costs?
Guild: The price of a living area of 160 square meters per house is EUR 184 000, without land.
That is easy to track.
Six months of construction has taken place.
That is appropriate.
Have the building rules complicated their plans?
Guild: I have run my project correctly.
What makes it particularly complicated is that there is always the imminent dam of Damocles and the regulation on posts.
Gruselig.
ES is still subordinated to who creates three apartments in a terraced house, at least three spaces are required.
It is only in towns that there is no room for this.
Refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How have the residents responded to their terraced house project?
Guild: There were people who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
This is definitely not true.
But do you not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?
Guild: It is true that we have had a building boom in Germany over the last five years, but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, also ordinary people need housing.
It is not only refugees who are refugees, but also the single mother or the low earners alike.
I would like to see how we can continue to build better today.
That is what it is about.
Markus Gildner studied microsystems engineering in Regensburg and initially focused on environmental analysis.
Ios 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released.
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings panel, typing on General, and then selecting the software update.
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, since they receive an error message that tells us that the software upgrade has failed.
In order to deal with the problem, it is recommended for users to wait until the rush or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
This might mean the removal of apps in order to create space - but Apple has made this less likely by streamlining the update, and it will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and reinstall them when the process is completed.
ES is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade, or that it is close to a charger, so the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, since the phone might be switched halfway and this could lead to a termination of the update.

Rosberg's only motto: Full attack.
Nico Rosberg only knows how to fight for the WM-Ttitle in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton.
The World Cup second emphasised before the start to the decisive seven overseas races, that I have nothing more to lose.
53 points separate the world leader in Singapore on this Sunday of Title Defender and Zweitsp-Champion Hamilton.
The Brite already won seven of the twelve season races so far.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brite was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city will have an impact on the Great Price of Singapore is still unclear.
Since days it has been hanging over the city as a result of fires caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The chess club, which was established three months ago, has taken up another member in his ranks, so the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has held more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Federal Merger of Merit and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein embraced.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot attend the membership contribution
Youth work and talent search are also to be taken forward.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and friendly contact with the tennis club will be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
The accommodation office is looking for direct contact.
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined forces under the cover of the social foundation, and a new point of contact opened at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations we can also take part in courses.
The Social Foundation takes it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More accurately, at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new service office was opened recently.
In addition to the shopping market, senior citizens and those who are seeking advice receive questions such as care insurance or services of nursing and nursing homes.
For years we have been working with our ambulance department to ensure that families who are often caring are left alone.
There are an endless number of questions.
In addition to this, the complexity of the insurance funds is not usually taken into account because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood by anyone, the new housekeeper of Jutta Weigand has been responsible for the staff of the staff of the staff as well as the representative of the Mayor as well as for the ambulance service of Amadeus.
In addition to the consultations, the new service office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
This was taken by Saludis on board.
Therefore, it is possible to take advantage of additional offers such as crash prevention, memory training or physical therapy.
The offers of the senior centre and the Saludis complement each other ideally.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
Here is the senior center for care, Heike Riedel, manager of Saludis.
This is the reason for the opening of the new service office in the city centre, especially in the case of demographic change.
This is essential for this to make a good central infrastructure in the various parts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, the Mayor of Wolfgang Metzner and the Mayor of Wolfgang Metzner dedicate himself to the celebrations of the inauguration: There are a number of events and offers on the programme and they invite you to take part in a regular social get-together.
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a significant contribution to enabling senior citizens to live as independently as possible in their trusted environment.
The accommodation office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9: 00 to 14: 00 from Tuesday to Thursday from 16: 00 to 18: 00 and on Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October.
It is now official: After the date for the match for FC Eintracht Bamberg has not yet been established in the event of renovation work at the Fuchspark-stadium, the deadline for the deadline of 6 October has been fixed.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the top finals of the Bavarian football Totopokals has now been definitively terminated for the third party of FC Würzburger Kickers.
It is played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 19: 00 in the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
We are glad that we now know when the game is going to take place, now we have planning security, so FCE-Teammanager Karlheinz Hümmer points out that it also points to the ticket sales that are now being launched.
ES is special for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore hope to see numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because flood light has a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Oberhaid moved to the district of 1: 1.
The winner of the contest gets 5000 euro and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Vereinspokas 2016 in 2017.
It is also possible to find a number of people who are interested in learning about it.
Vienna architect Karl Mang died of death from the age of 65.
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of the Vienna Architecture, is dead.
He already died on September 5, September at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house left an honorary member and at the same time one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he has been working as a freelance architect, but he has also worked as a teacher, writer, and editor.
From 1972 until 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of design.
In the 1980s he was appointed with the institution of the treasury of the Vienna Imperial Palace and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim throws a policeman with money with money
Ex-footballer Tim meadow has been noticed in Bremen.
Footballer was once, and meanwhile Tim meadow, ex-national keeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, was involved with Wrestler.
He wants to have 30 kilos of muscle mass according to his own statement over the last two years.
On the other hand, he did not put intellectual on his side.
In the centre of Bremen, it was possible to cut the hair when he saw how a parking hawk Guardian presented a penalty for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Subsequently, out of the business, the official offended her and threw her the due fine before the feet like the picture he reported to the newspaper.
The accusations are confirmed at the city of Bremen, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
The matter is still under examination, it is called from the city of Bremen.
It is only after that that it is decided whether to display grass or not.
Authorities in Panama destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile ground and the ancient climate of Isla del Rey are best suited to the growth of marijuana plants.
For three days, the Panamas authorities have seized the 4500 plants and they burn them.
Men on a 17-year-old Afghan to be tested on a 17-year-old Afghan.
The police are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23: 45 p.m., three young men were on foot from Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster.
One from the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed by the police followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters and called for them to wait for him.
At that point, the group was at the height of the bhp pot.
On the site of the petrol station there were also three people.
One of these men now cried out to young people and proposed to face it with the fist.
The victim suffered a breach of the nose and blew up a strong nose.
When his two friends attempted to stir up the racquet, he first left his victim.
From his friends, the injured young man was now brought home.
The author followed the group with a passenger car to their home and suddenly disappeared on a number of occasions.
When you no longer saw the vehicle, the injured was left in front of the building in order to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked by the racquet and another male person.
With the help of a stroke it is considered on the face and the thighs of the victim.
The victim had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
To date, there is only a vague description of the work.
One of the men was about 1.80 m in size.
The second racquet was supposed to be 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in a pair of jeans and a braid-white shirt.
The police would like to ask witnesses and signal that they are required to report £06181 to 100 123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes part in field breaks and invests 310000 Euro.
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felmann.
This is also the reason why we are looking forward to hearing from you.
In many places in the country there are no doctors - Asendorf is lucky: On 1 October, Dr. Frank Müller takes part in the practice of field breaks.
While Ursel retires from his successor in the coming months in the coming months, his successor, Karl-Heinrich, is still on the side of his successor.
After a period of reconstruction, Müller opens the practice on 12 October, and until then he has invested 310000 euros in the premises at the St. Marcellusstraße 6.
ES was sympathy at first glance when the field met years ago when Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who currently takes part in her medical treatment at the Verdener Krankenhaus and wants to get into practice in practice at present.
We have always had in mind that the garbage would fit well into this practice, Dr. Ursel tells us that Felmann is taking a break and laughing.
When it was so far, I simply called it.
The idea that was liked by the Müller couple was to pursue its own practice in future in Asendorf.
The proximity and the constant contact with patients are very attractive to us, says the 39-year-old Müller.
We want to meet the families over the years and accompany them.
He also sees himself as an asset to being his own boss.
And so one was agreed that the waste was bought by the house with practice.
They will continue to live at break-house Vilsen.
This is where the two-fold family grew up in Frank Müller, his medical clinic in Hannover was followed by a number of doctors' offices, and it was followed by hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
At present he is a dentist in Sulingen and in 2009 he was appointed as the chief physician in Diepholz County and is voluntarily involved in the shelling of breakhouse Vilsen.
From September 19, the practice for the new boss will be prepared.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felmann is working as a family doctor, his wife Ursel has specialized in the field of gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both interns, wish to establish themselves as family physicians.
The endoscopy therefore comes out of use, says the 38 year old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After being renovated, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound and long-term and load EKGs and we will need a speaking room more.
What is more, data processing is being fully updated.
A grant of EUR 50000 million has been granted to the Müllers within the framework of a programme of funding from EUR 25000 in support of EUR 25000 and from the SamtCommunity of EUR 12500 and to the municipality of EUR 12500.
This shows how proud and delighted we are that the practice will continue, it emphasizes the master of velvet.
About 2000 patients arrive at the surgery every quarter according to Silvia Müller-Gonger-Gongoll's Gongoll, and in the North German practice it is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another in-house practice practice.
A positive side effect of the practical assumption by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf according to Ursel.
If no successor had found it, she would have left.
By the way, anyone who visits Müllers will continue to look in familiar faces: The seven medical professionals and the cleaning force will take over from the field experts.
When they leave, there is an era in Asendorf which has been practiced there for 30 years.
While at the beginning we had only two rooms, Ursel reminds us of something Ursel reminds us of.
They feel a little of sadness after the long time.
However, we live further in Hohenmoor and a lot of patients will surely still often see one which says the boarding school.
Your husband complements Lachend: We have a 6000-square meter plot.
So far, I have always pressed for garden work, and now things could become different.
In addition, the pair has two legs and will be happy to travel.
Croatia: We allow us to leave the refugees by means of a collection of refugees.
Now the border controls also become high on our southern limit, said she said Johanna Miklessel tner.
The controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to request asylum can also make this possible.
The focus is on the supply and security of people.
Although it is clear that it needs clear signals, the Minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept limitless migratory flows, even via the Austro-Slovene border.
ES requires a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering Comprehensive Corruption - Slovenia
The Croatian Government had previously told us that Slovenia also wanted to bring forward incoming refugees to Austria and Germany, and that we can also establish corridors for the refugees.
So, this was not the case for the Minister of the Interior, Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is absolutely unacceptable, Slovenia will intensify the surveillance of the border, particularly with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister has pointed out, Slovene wants to ensure that the borders of refugees do not cover the borders of refugees.
Member of the EU must fill out its obligations, otherwise the system cannot operate, stressed Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian Government has said, the first refugees have already attempted to pass through Tovarnik to Tovarnik on Tuesday in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police took up them in the fields of maize.
According to local media, Seitdem in Croatian Tovarnik constantly gather police vehicles with new refugees.
ES are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including a large number of women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country with around 4,000 refugees will be expected to take place, as Interior Minister of the Interior said Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo to the Macedonian border of Macedonia, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade has found that it is the people who wish to take certain routes: We can, as we do, continue to do so, and it was said that we can do so.
According to the media reports, in the morning of the morning, a first bus of around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of sid, whereas in the course of the day more buses would be expected.
Via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria after Germany
The inmates had travelled the Macedonian border by Serbia all the night from the Macedonian border of Serbia which was about 500 kilometres away.
What we have heard is that Hungary has admitted this, so the police have told us that we are supposed to drive here, and one of the refugees said.
They wanted to go further to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
In this way, it might indeed be possible for us to move forward to a slightly further west course for the observers who have already predicted that we have already previously postponed Turkey's Ukraine Route, Turkey, to Turkey in Macedonia, which is Turkey.
Croatia: Comprehensive possibilities for controlling borders
Croatia's Minister for the Interior has previously stressed that his country has prepared plans for possible exceptional situations for the case of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen Member, had extensive possibilities for border control.
Strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been involved in this since 2007, and EU partners are a good testimony to the country of Seitdem, with regard to the standard of border controls.
On Serbian side, about 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrader media coverage, they would have spent the last night on the Horn pass that leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg will continue to be completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees wish to move on to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic, has still been trying to reassure Wednesday morning when there is a local star in Horgos: It seems to me that it is too soon to discuss alternative routes for refugees once the Hungarian border is closed.
It would not be very high numbers of refugees at present.
It is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Aid workers discourage migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the refugees where alternative routes are drawn through Croatia.
The border between Serbia and Croatia is not without danger: In parts of the border there are still 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a mining team was sent to the border region.
Stock exchange hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cyber-criminal who is accused of gaining access to yet unreleased financial reports and press releases since 2010 on sites like Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire.
The information that has been collected is supposed to have made insider trading on the financial markets.
This is how, according to investigators, more than $100 million were launched in total.
Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught, it is stated in the SET communication.
The trials against 32 other suspects continued in the case.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are to have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Relief Mannheim has been operating for 20 years.
There is a lot of activity to be done around Mannheimer Platz.
People do their business, some of them step by bit, and sometimes they are comfortable.
You control the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at the spot.
Keep city railways open.
It is possible to take a look at what is going to happen.
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid has drawn attention to its 20 years of operation and faces mixed reactions.
It is about life, so we are involved with the action in the middle of the city and among people, says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Relief is at the disposal of passers-by as well, as do the voluntary staff.
While some people use a passant spontaneously to the circle, and can read the sentence to give my life in favour of reading my life, talking to the camper by the USA, stop the war or keep it short, others will remain short, reading sentences like that I am not yet active, and then go further.
Time and again, on the margins of small discussions about action, about life, dealing with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on the spot.
When I realise that for me the end of this world comes to an end, I can live responsibly, says the director of the Diakonics Works Mannheim, which is together with the Caritas Association of the Ecumenical Hospice Relief.
This is why this high-profile effective action is good for the 20-year-olds.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables, it is understandable that it is a very personal matter.
The issue of death and death is still taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the Hospice movement in recent years has made a great contribution to opening up people.
This is an assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The funeral companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to become involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid was called up by honorary officials, they registered immediately and had been involved in the establishment in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - who are accompanied in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can work well with her task and the experiences and experiences that have been achieved.
When I see life from another, it seems to me the moment of precious treasures, says it.
The offer of the Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations by family members and associations enables the training as well as the training and supervisions of the mature and experienced attendants.
Every two years, training courses for new employees are offered.
The panels described on Saturday are now in the house of the Evangelical Church. M1, 1a and in the house of the Catholic Church issued F2, 6.
It is also possible to take note of other personal wishes on postcards.
FedEx Results mixed, Changing Financial prospects for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant cut off his prize for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its service to Boeing.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wanted to hire 50,000 seasonal workers during the holiday period.
The share fell by more than 2.5 percent in pre-market trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said that profit between 10.40 $and $10,90 in the fiscal year that ends in May is 20 cents less than previous forecast.
According to a survey of FactSet, analysts expected $10,84 $.
Despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and will take effect on January 4, and despite higher supplements for ground transportation of heavy and large packages that will be collected as of November.
The company said that it still expects the result to increase compared with the prior year as a result of cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, Chairman and CEO, has said that the company will yield solid returns if the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade, is taken into account.
The plans for holiday employment have been announced a day later as announced by rival UPS, which plans to set more than 90.000 to 95,000 additional workers, such as the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just below $2.44 billion per share that twelve analysts surveyed by Zack Investment Research predicted.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts questioned by Zack expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has recorded a decrease in international priority shipments, which brought sales in its unity of express shipment.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
Sales rose by 29 percent in the last quarter, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
Express Unity recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell as a result of higher labor costs in cargo operations.
In Precommercial trading, around an hour before opening, Sanken of FedEx stock by 3.85, or 2.5 percent, compared to 150.15 $.
On Tuesday, they dropped at 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11, June.
At their most awaited meeting in the year, Federal Reserve spent two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany to decide whether it is time to raise the benchmark policy for the first time in nearly a decade.
Droc via them is located at an end of the decorated two-storeyed session which is a wall of the United States.
The card is a reminder that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues want to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximizing US employment and prices is stable.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed has acknowledged that there is an uncalled third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to escape from the unprecedented incentive of the short-term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008.
While most economic data show that they are growing solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fedora Representatives anxious to step up this volatility by raising interest rates for federal bonds - and not a quarter of the percentage point.
The most important thing they can expect is the labour market, and inflation will be the most important thing they observe, said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
But I think if they were looking for a pretext for not raising the interest rate, the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting, she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which is causing uncertainty about the financial market itself.
About half of the economists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect to wait for the Fed, with a key indicator, which shows only 30% of the opportunity to increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% on 16,599,85.
The action was created by expectations that the Fed policy maintains the sentence this week, saying John Lonski, chief economist at Moody, is Capital Markets Research Group.
I would be a surprise if the Fed would lift the rates at that time, he said.
If they do, they would have to go very far in their statement in order to reassure the financial markets so that they do not panic.
Other experts argued that raising interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen said in spring and in early summer that this year, despite liberals' complaints that more economic progress would be required, they expect to increase the rate.
Although the creation of jobs slowed in August, improvements in the labour market have been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest since more than seven years, and the level that the Fed regards as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And, although inflation continued to fall below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fedora Representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices.
The economy can cope with higher interest rates, and it needs it because of the tension in the labor market, said Ian Shepher-based, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world joined the world at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May to more than 16% below its peak, as investors worried that a slowdown in China's economy would reduce global growth.
The market has recovered a little this month, and the Dow is now nearly 10% below May.
For the Fedora Representatives, market turbulence influences the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
When the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks would not have occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract the reins at this sitting, said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least one month to get to grips with the impact.
There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China, Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not the Fed's primary concern, so it should not be taken into account when it comes to their decision-making.
But, at the end of the day, the Fed has become the currency authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of the then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could reduce its monetarist expansions triggered confusion around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it is possible for the Fedora Representatives to monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Your decision-making is more art than science, he said Zachary Karabell, Director of the Global Strategy for the Management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, remarked this month that the Fed has a history of overreaction to financial-market movements that do not appear to be associated with economic fundamentals.
Lacker, voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998 as an example in 1998.
A financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to reduce its interest rate by 0.75 percentage points to three meetings despite limited recognition of growth in the US, Lacker said.
A year later, the Fedora Representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first during a serious crisis such as the collapse of the 2008 market, said Adam S. Poznań, the former member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the Bank of England.
The recent turmoil does not come near this level, he said.
Certainly, you do not want to get into the situation where they are afraid of raising interest rates, because the markets are getting excited, saying Poznań, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until this is amended, I do not believe that it should advance time.
Do you need a great Thai-market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often called Thai Costco and is a Thai-wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market is a central office and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious ornaments and Christmas decorations.
ES even gives a car department if you require engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes more than one hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shopping cart makes you hungry, there is a meal in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garké kitchen at reasonable prices is good and has a variety of acquisition options in this store.
What there is here: You need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C is likely to have it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and more.
The meat counter is extensive, and the fish counter - the staff behind the bar will clean the fish, and even on request it is possible for you.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department, where you can find frozen curry leaves, more bitter melon and a few of them, fish, cattle and gall, pork, fish baguets, regional sausage, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys, it is restaurant owners and cooks, including individual families and individuals.
The wide gears are suitable for commercial cars and forklifts.
You will find here: Fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash desk.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial estate of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and the city centre - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, together with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well attended, it is not difficult to find a parking place.
Hoyerswerda: Little aid to refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany during these days.
Welcoming you to a warm welcome is not without the involvement of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, too, there are a lot of people who support disinterested asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a master teacher.
She is still happy to be taught with her 74 ties with her.
Every Thursday, she does it at the Dillinger Straße at the end of Thursday.
This is where it helps to help refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from that of a proper school.
Brazil's Guatrian Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for good
The Brazilian Paediac organisation SPRS is trying to inform women of the importance of good nutrition during the lifetime of presenting pictures of babies to breasts that are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
As a result of the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers will be advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietetic adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women really affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions to the new Bernrieder Sports Hall
The Municipal Council of Bernried approved the request for construction of the 2.3 million Euro expensive gym.
And it made an exception.
The roof is allowed to be flat for solar panels.
Plans for the long-awaited turnaround at the Bernrieder sports area are taking a step forward: The recent municipal council meeting has unanimously approved the draft of work without much discussion.
Before that, the Board decided among other things to make a request for a statutory exemption from the current plan of construction.
The exception to this was permission for a special form with regard to roof construction.
As a result, a canopy with non-integral first and roof is to be built.
Background of planning: The planned use of the roof area for solar systems is as follows: We get a wonderfully large southern roof together, declared Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
When it came to freedom of movement, this was once again the propensity to rise below ten degrees for energetic reasons - in contrast to what is laid down in the building plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
This is why it is necessary to exempt them from this because the building plan does not allow for any exceptions to the roof as regards the roof of the roof.
This is not a recurring project: We do not create a precedent for this, as is the Steigenberger.
The stadium building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
A total of approximately EUR 2.3 million is calculated at cost.
Subsidies are expected from education and grassroots sport.
In the next stage of the procedure, the application for the 18 x 36 meters will now be presented to the hall for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The hospital of Peißenberg is expected to be closed earlier than planned for 2016.
At the same time, Dr Wilhelm Fischer will receive 66 new medical director at the hospital Schongau.
The station as well as the majority of staff move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is due to the surprising plans of the County Hospital GmbH, which confirmed the presence of the farmers, Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board, and it will be held on Wednesday, 23 September.
If plans are implemented, all of the 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the existing Inner Station.
The rooms are there.
The employees who cannot come to Schongau in Weilheim will be offered to Jochner-@@
The staff are informed of the plans.
Since the beginning of the beginning of the year, Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to private practice in immediate vicinity of the hospital, has been initiated by Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year.
When it comes to the question of who is to take the lead, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name that has agreed to take part in the game, he was prepared to take the lead from 1 October and move to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, in any case, this means a revaluation of an appreciation and a broadening of the offer in the area of internal medicine, so Jochner-white.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau specializes in gastroenterological diseases which are specialized in gastroenterological diseases.
For the next two years, for the next two years, fishermen with his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses, until then next year, the former hospital of the workforce that still has 35 beds, is to be closed definitively in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
Up to now, this was planned for 2018 when the rehabilitation of the hospital in Weilheim is currently under way.
Mr Jochner-Weiß, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, spoke against rumours that the House, which is in possession of the federal system, should in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seekers.
I agree with what I have to say about property, and how it goes on with the property, Jochner-Weiß could not say there are a number of ideas.
At present a short term care of Caritas and a daily psychiatry are placed.
What better we could not do, such an opportunity does not come back again, fishermen about the quasi-move to the Lech, which has been favourably received by employees in a positive and sympathetic manner.
There has been no real prospect of the House where fishermen have been working as a chief doctor for more than 30 years.
He has been asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director.
The hospital Peißenberg, which was once 100 beds, was threatened in recent decades by the threat of closure, departments were closed, for example surgery was closed, for example the surgery and the help of birth.
The players of the Rhein-Neckar Lion are now asking for about 20.15 clock at the Bergisches HC.
The team in Wuppertal is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to exaggerate.
In the last season, the Badener lost a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to do with it.
Hunting with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were hard injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the settlement of a corn field at Pratau County Wittenberg, several hunters were involved in the way in which the police reported.
After a shot, a 63and 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and was brought to hospitals.
It was unclear how exactly it was possible for the accident to take place.
The criminal police are being investigated.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, the victim of violent crimes
A crime of crime has led the police to the suffering of the 16-year-olds who have disappeared since Saturday.
In interrogation, 20 years of age gave birth to young people, throwing their corpse into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a crime of violence.
The man of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, how the prosecutor's office and police rushed on Wednesday.
As an activist, there is also a 20-year-old who has been arrested on Tuesday evening, and who indeed denoted and led the investigators to the location of the corpse.
The 16-year old was missing on Sunday morning after they had not come home on the eve of a visit to a fall in Rockenhausen.
When looking for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
If you would like to take a look at the circle of friends, then there was a suspicion of the 20-year-olds.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the corpse was found.
According to the authorities, in police custody, the 16-year-old was killed and the corpse placed in the channel.
The 20-year-old should be presented on Wednesday to the pier judge, the investigators put a shot on his back.
What is more, it is important for us to investigate the further investigations.
Refugees who need accommodation: Study warns of housing gaps
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are seeking to remain affordable.
Pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing faces a challenge.
The distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing to a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
In order to cover the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020.
This is the result of a study on behalf of the association of the association of social housing development.
Comparison: This year, 260.000 units will be completed in Germany.
This means there are a shortfall of 140 000 homes.
After the first three months of their visit, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation.
Many then enter into the housing market and ranks in the long queues in front of the rented housing.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers attended the last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only about the increase in the number of refugees.
The study also accounts for considerable failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is producing a housing deficit that is larger from year to year.
At present, there are already a shortage of more than 750,000 homes in conurbations, deploring Matthias Günther, author of the study.
This is why many of the professionals lived in large cities in WG-rooms.
Young adults remained online because of the Flaute on the housing market involuntarily longer in the hotel Mama.
In large cities, the figure of square meters per head in recent years has fallen again for the first time.
In order to resolve the problem, the alliance of social housing is proposing to restart it.
New incentives are intended to revive social housing.
In this way, the basic value tax could be dispensed with and the basic tax on assisted housing should be suspended.
Moreover, according to the alliance, attractive tax write-offs are needed.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation in the state-owned bank KfW is already good for cities and municipalities.
More than half of the EUR 300 million available on Monday evening was already more than half of the EUR 300 million available on Monday evening with EUR 184 million.
Now the project could be increased.
Refugees have free money: Croatia and Slovenia are establishing a corridor.
After Hungary, virtually no more is possible, as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia.
Zagreb announces that the passage through Slovenia to the north will be granted without obstacles.
But the route is dangerous, however.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister for Home Affairs, and when it is necessary, we will organize a corridor, said the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After closing the border of Serbia and Hungary, hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to enter Western Europe.
500 people have come across the Tovarnik border, the Croatian television station reports RTL.
Hungary ended its border for refugees on the previous day.
New laws that entered into force on the same day also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary superfluous.
Croatia wants to allow the refugees to happen.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: You can travel through it and we are preparing for that possibility.
These people are there; they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, ES are people who do not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police took up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia.
Most were media reports from syria, Iran, and Afghanistan.
They came with both the bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to cross the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serb border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
There are other dangers to this: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
He is now supposed to create a safe passage now.
After Hungary, however, very few refugees come after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 dead people.
Shortly before the Monday of Monday it was 9380.
The new Hungarian laws to cope with overcoming and damaging the border is a criminal offence.
This is why 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
They are condemned to the threat of prison sentences, up to five years of prison and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, on Tuesday, on Tuesday, a total of 94 asylum applications was accepted on Tuesday at the border set on the border, of which almost all of them - 93 - on the most important route.
Among the applicants, there are 13 families with little children as well as two older people.
On Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees there.
In practice, however, no one has any idea of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
After Hungarian opinion, Serbia is a security third country of security.
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered before the transit zone in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers started to clean up.
They collected the waste that left tens of thousands of people at the edge of the last weeks.
The fences have been reduced and one of the host camps in the border has been rebuilt.
No one wanted to speak on the goal of this restructuring.
Following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria will reach only a few refugees.
The country has also reinforced its border controls.
However, in order to achieve this, the population of 20 000 remained in the country according to government instructions.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people wait for the journey to Germany.
Trains from there to Germany have been stopped by instructions of the German authorities in the morning.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot.
Mayor of America Returns About the Border
When we were occupied after the bridge on Sunday with the, when suddenly ten people with travel agents at the entrance of the tent stood at the entrance of the tent, so Wseriously Mayor Alois Stadler stood.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because on Sunday, on Sunday, because of the influx of refugees, Germany had a surprising number of railway lines with Austria, it was for them in Wernstein, a town that immediately offered its help to him and saw two further helpers and their cars close to Passau along with two further helpers and their cars.
Prior to that we have been able to make sure we have a good time to relax, with a snack and drink.
We say we bring them to Passau by car.
For us this was something we were in favour of, so Stadler was talking in OÖN.
They were very grateful.
A man could not take it to give a generous donation - 100 euro for the fire brigade.
This is something we were delighted to see, so Stadler was delighted to welcome it.
On Sunday evening, on Sunday evening, the stranded train passengers moved to Wels, an ICE in a regional train to Passau, to reach Germany after the short term announcement that rail transport was stopped by Germany, while still trying to reach the border.
However, before the border in Wernstein the regional train was parked at the Inn.
In Wernstein, in general terms, this is high on a regular basis.
The bridge with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday organized by the Union of Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of hypocritical politics:
Instead of immediately helping the Röszke camp establish structures that ensure humanity, our German Chancellor has formally and publicly placed the position of the Hungarian Government in the shadow of National Socialism.
It is unfortunate that this policy is not only the Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The disappearances will also have to conclude that the much-vaunted country that has invited them and welcomed them is nothing but another refugee camp.
ES will be a big challenge, given the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter to establish a dignified situation for those who seek refuge.
And it will be even greater - peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter winegged quartz
Konrad has every hand to do with the treatment of refugees.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word.
The government has used the previous powerful Raiffeisen-Banker to establish accommodation for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first centre of Traiskirchen has already been brought under control by Konrad.
Let We have no homeless in Traiskirchen, he reported of his first success.
Also the accommodation of the 20 000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday is without great fuss, said Konrad, and praised the organizational level of organizational performance.
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a situation of crisis in crisis.
In total, Konrad expects a need for 85,000 species of quartz in this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries, 15,000 of the Federation.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it is not a barrel without bottom, said Konrad." said Konrad.
He has already held talks with the capitals.
They would have promised him that he would still be able to deal with the forthcoming refugees.
"We know how to make it possible," said Ferry Maier, who lives in Upper Austria.
The former VP Mandate is supported by Konrad.
In the morning there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, who will be told how the church will help.
Great expectations also help the asylum coordinator to help the ORF action as we do it.
On the platform private individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
We also hope to see hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as a very high level of housing.
In case of emergency, it is not possible for the service provider to have to comply with a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the upper.
For a temporary period, emergency standards of emergency would have to apply.
That he was more successful with the Ministry of the Interior, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, founded Konrad and his experience.
I am an older gentleman whom we cannot talk about reality without another
The force of persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause any costs to the Republic as they have declared themselves.
Your staff want to increase them to three to four.
So far, it has not yet been successful to make use of the service we have requested from you.
Konrad wanted to place a container at St. Stephen's Square as an office.
However, there appear to be problems with approval.
Calling for a better distribution of Linz
For the moment, opening up urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planned by the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at present, because at present it is impossible for people to be accommodated without these measures, it is said that the role of Mayor Klaus Luger is the SP.
In case of emergency, however, further locations for their suitability are to be considered.
Criticism is being levelled at the head of the town about the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to contribute.
Seehofer: Border limits are not sealed
In the course of a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister, Horst Seehofer, the Governor of Germany, Josef Pühringer, has acquitted himself of further action on the question of refugees on Monday.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed.
It is still possible to continue the journey of refugees to Germany.
However, it is precisely the appropriate border controls that exist.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being.
However, the people who are seeking protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity with regard to the question of refugees.
The fact that Austria is now also introducing controls at its borders is a logical consequence of the actions of the Germans.
The Next Runtastic is a Question of Time
The general renovation of the new shipyard in line with the Linzer Industrial Line has been officially concluded.
In four of the six floors of the office and production facility, the publicly traded IT-Group S & T has been recovered; the rest of €2700 square metres is to be rented to young, innovative companies in the field of technology.
Talking In the IT are the wise minds of our raw materials - and we must try to work for us, says S & T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine investing in start-up firms of the New Boatyard and subsequently acquiring them.
From the very beginning S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - there is a promise of what Niederhauser promises: The next Runtastic is just a matter of time.
€1.7 million has been invested by S & T in the location, €3.3 million from the TechCenter, which is one third of the city of Linz, the land of Upper Austria and the Federal Government.
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S & T and TechCenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meter in the building has already been rented for a further 40 percent of inquiries.
Lia-Peroni has opened its second business in the Arctic.
There is a focus in the new shop.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to buy a dog.
This project has had to push off Lia Peroni's 49 year-old in the Taubenmarkt-Arkade: After all, it has grown in the form of another business.
In the Furlach shop opposite the shop in which they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and garments from various manufacturers, everything is now about Furla's pockets on women's clothes, having to have money exchanges at the age of 75.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were rebuilt.
However, I have been considering for a long time whether I want to open a shop, that is to say Breit.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the wine producers who are also at home in Bologna were impressed by the idea of their own site where only their handbags are sold.
We are the only one in the area of Linz that sells this brand, we say the mother of two daughters who has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been brought to her mother by her mother.
Most of the time, when something is developed, I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women get into a bag of sleep when they are looking at a nice handbag, it is not possible to answer the question of last security.
Maybe it is because there is a beautiful bag for each outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump's forefathers came from a place whose inhabitants are called Antor.
This property also links some of them with the billionaire who wants to become the US president.
Donald Trump is always good if you want to use 69.
Whether he expresses xenophobic views, journalists, or gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency is throwing up the campaign hard.
And performs well.
This is also registered in the pfälzischen Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate come from billions of dollars.
The New York, which is the youngest of them, is one of the most popular in the Winzerdorf on the Wine Road.
Mancher in the 1200 squadron is used over -dozens of corners with him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump.
The Kalltown Simone Wendel shot a movie about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about their goal of becoming the world's most powerful man?
I think they think this is exciting, but they are not so impressed with their Kallstadter, which is what Simone Wendel says.
The native speaker has shot an amusing documentary about the town and his famous little horses, to which next to Trump the Heinz Ketchup family counts.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, can also speak in the kings of Kallstadt in 2014, with a statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the king of hearts there.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, it also tends to think that Trump is already a bit of a big grunt, saying Wendel.
Coincidentally the nickname, the town of Kallstadt in the vicinity, makes it possible for the Brulljesmacher to become one of German: The donor, says it.
Trump comes from the village of Antor.
In 1885, the Trumpish success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a bar for gold graves in the United States.
The foundation stone of the Real Estate Group was initial real estate purchases in New York.
But the lives of grandparents were not free of tragedy: Their desire to return to their homes in the long term failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He failed to accept Trump because he was once without permission, the director of the Institute for pfular History and Popular, Roland Paul, explained how to start the film.
Trump is one of the offspring of an illegal emigrant.
This is in contrast to what are sometimes signs of descendants.
He repeatedly spoke out about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a wall to deter illegal immigrants.
This is not so likeable, says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant Trumps who has been born. Oma was a born Trump who was born by the Opa.
In retirement, the wine producer tends to distance himself from the Americans; he is always so excited about it.
Does he think Trump will come ever?
I can't imagine what I can imagine, the 72-year-old says.
He never cared for the city of Kallstadt.
Like some of the Kallstadter, the Veronika Schramm mentions that a descendant of the Heinz donated something to the church organ during a visit, which is generally good.
I cannot imagine that of the Donald who does not imagine, and she tells the 68-year-old
It would be better if he did not brave the election, for the one who has such radical views, I do not know if that is good.
If those who had said this to the United States at the time of his grandfather would have been like him, he would never have had anything to do with it.
"There are more interesting topics than him, says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
My president, My president, is not one of them, she says.
And: The TRAUBEN will also be ready without the President Trump.
Wendel's film, for which the Trump was interviewed for a long time, saw 12 000 cinema singers, while the US also has an interest in it.
The Upper Bavarian town of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first commercial mountaineering village.
From the hand of the vice-president of the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-resident village of the "Berchtesgaden" was awarded on Wednesday the award for soft tourism.
In Austria, there are already 20 pairs of mountaineering villages.
In the neighbouring country, the Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A mountain of mountaineering can have no more than 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its surface area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven busy Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of the Liberals" leadership, but there have been no major shifts in the reviews of Today.
The breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the capital of Germany when Malcolm Turnbull completed the fall of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators of David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one-week series of international TV broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage seemed to have no role to play for Australian TV viewers, because Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 spectators in the five capitals, compared to the world of Today 339,000.
Today reached an easy increase in comparison with the ratings for Monday based 317,000 years and last Tuesday estimated at 283,000, but its number fell back to what was estimated at 343,000 last Thursday.
Today, the gap with Sunrise has closed in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330.000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise stands at 314,000 spectators at an average of 349,000 spectators.
This is the most interesting thing to happen every morning.
The winds of change affect this morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are in order, thank you for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently forgotten father, who has escaped from settling on his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive figure of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics asked if Thomson could carry a Hitshow Solo without the Rafator Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes" vote.
Seven of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers, and easily beat The Block 8388 000 and TBL Families 726.000.
Seven had mixed results in the evening of two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of 17: 00 to 5.30 AM the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew, he showed on average 44,000 spectators.
The second half hour of 17: 30 p.m. to 18: 00 jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires.
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators, reaching 720,000 in the second half of an hour.
This is an average of 620,000 on average.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will convince Nine that it will eventually be possible to enforce this by 17: 30 at the end of the day.
The Chase Australia is a replacement of $1 million a minute which failed to get rid of the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who is he going to choose?
What on earth does it reveal?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may unwittingly have an unconscious idea of who wins The Bachelor.
The woman in whom Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was kept in greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining will certainly not reveal whether they are the one who received the last Rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before it was checked out from three two, you might accidentally have made a hint of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips until the final on Thursday.
All three women have left out in lyrical ways why Wood is the perfect man to call his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitudes as reasons why they like to be their partner.
However, when the question is asked, if it is not you who should get the heart of the bachelor, anyone who is going to receive a last rose by Woods might become their answer to the fate of who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markosky called both quickly - besides themselves - Mackay as the best partner for wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one.
From the moment when I came to the house, and from what I saw, I noticed that she was pretty compatible, and I thought it was pretty compatible throughout the course of the show, saying Jeavons-Fellows.
If Sarah is on both feet on earth, it makes so much fun, together with her, added Markoski.
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable to each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be good as a pair.
From her point of view, Mackay told her that last week she made clear that wood could be one of the A.
When I saw him with my friends and the family, it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now fully committed to it, she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not, she was puzzling.
I do not know if I can say that can say, she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is broadcast on 10 on Wednesday, 19: 30 on Wednesday.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest when they moved to the US - and there were many other teams that sent questions after its impressive open meeting at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Trainer Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banished Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a scramble as it did on his first Punt-Return with his first Punt-Return on Tuesday, the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband, and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a Punt-Return and also to the current game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing room after the match.
Instead of grinding his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49er Sportreporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patched catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patches at a Punt who has been restored in the first game area of Minnesota Vikings.
ES was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left after the fumble fluchend and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
What happened was a thing that seems to happen, it is taken care of only around the next game, and that is it said Hayne did.
Hayne made his film debut in 2007, when a pass ran into a Try for Queensland.
On the whole, it has been a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne was posing for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and postete it on his installer.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights.
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian roll with armed force.
Having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, he condemned his oil company Yukos and stopped his democratic efforts.
Because of the high number of refugees, the open electorate is calling for the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria.
Warning at the beginning of the FW-Herbst in Greater Wallstadt before a severe crisis in Bavaria if there is no new teacher for the many new students, we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools before collapse, said Aiwanger.
Otherwise, we will have disruptions in the Bavarian educational system.
Friday, Friday is Friday, Friday in the Lower Franconian community.
In fact, other major issues have been envisaged.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free vote.
Needless to say, the subject of asylum will cover the subject of asylum, as Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in syries, as was the case during the wars of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
It is no longer possible for us to continue, we have to address the causes of business, it was said by the head of the vote.
Discarded asylum seekers want to postpone the free voters as soon as possible.
This is why Aiwanger also required more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: We also need at least 50 new asylum magistrates, said Aiwanger.
The Fed chairman criticized the fact that several federal states are not consistent: We need uniform standards of the federal states across Germany.
While Bavaria is shifting from one another to another, others do not.
We need to make it possible for us to be able to act.
But the politics of great walltown is not supposed to fall below the table.
The agenda for a period of many years remains on the agenda: Education policy.
With regard to the new Year of Education, the Minister of Culture, Ludwig Spaenle, has started the pilot experiment in 47 Gymnasia to the pilot experiment of middle level, thus testing an extension of the secondary level from three to four years to another - nine years before graduation.
But this does not go far enough.
The topic of G9 needs to be accelerated, said the FW-chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all Gymnasia, who want to do so.
Free ride to G9 where it is desired.

4 people killed when police forces shot blankets on protesters in Nepal.
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police blanket demonstrated in a crowd of crowd Schoss, who protested against the proposed new constitution, saying an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, approximately 175 miles to the west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, and some of you threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr Dhakal said that the police have used tear gas and that they shot into the air before they fell back on a rubberhand.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear to me why the rubbertoys which were used, which are known to be able to kill them, which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, appear to have produced such a high death rate.
The debate has been the last in weeks of violence in Nepal at southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces created under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violence since 10.
August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, killed an important step toward a new constitution, but it was a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted on certain clauses this week in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.

The town of Emden bought a part of the land, which is located on the ring road, and bought it a few months ago.
Project HIEVE: Details are on the table
Plans for holiday housing in the small seaside resort of Emden are taking shape.
For the first time, the investor presented public plans for the project.
A number of people are still concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure activities.
For months, negotiations took place behind closed doors, subject to debate, debate and drawing.
Now plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Small Sea are near Emden on the table.
On Monday evening, on Monday evening in the Committee of the European Union, the small and medium-sized company of Emder presented its plans to public on Monday evening.
Originally, this point was on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDD group, which accused investors and management of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the management of the system went to the offensive: We still do not have an answer to all questions, he said before the Council and more than 50 visitors.
However, it is good to be able to meet all the rumours now.
Ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects have been under discussion for months.
The pictures and new details about the structure of the hotel gave rise to the reactions from landlords who came to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, Meerbudenowner and a board member of the Board of Directors with regard to the interest of the assailants Pro HIEVE, This is a giant clotch, surrenders of all other buildings.
In addition to a number of other project critics, he also fears that traffic would increase greatly as a result of the proposed size of the plant: All that needs to happen is that there must be a total of bus charges in order to calculate what Schulz expects.
However, what is happening exactly on one hectare of former restaurant area is still open.
There is still no operator.
If we need to have a coherent concept, we have said it is Ralf Behrends.
Because this has still been lacking, the building plans are still variable.
Twin offspring of Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy to welcome young people to their gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare in the case of gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and has been in Frankfurt in 1967, so it is called the zoo.
The sex of the newborns Gorilla twins is not yet firm, as Mother Dian so far has a close relationship with the body.
First the picture had reports about it.
NHC offers a 60% chance for cyclone to the south of Cape Verde Islands.
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a large low pressure system of about 350 miles approximately 350 miles south of the most southern Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60% potential for forming a tropical hurricane in the next two days, and it added to the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches doubling donor campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc., Inc., announced a £11 million campaign that seeks to raise $11 million for humanitarian organisations to help the thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations, as they are fleeing from the war and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donor appeal on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee, who has fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
One of our trips included a lot of dark rail and bus routes, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear, she wrote.
I was lucky.
However, as the crisis in Europe has grown on the part of the crisis in Europe, many people like my family are looking desperately for help.
The donations go to four voluntary organisations which provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Médecins Sans Frontières, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe faces its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely due to the four-year civil war that has taken place in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya from the war of war.

For slightly larger diabetics, weight loss surgery can help.
The benefits of the weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
The death data requires a long time to show something, said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, which wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved to be effective, but most studies have been carried out among people who are disease-obese with a body mass index that is 35% or higher.
BMI, which has a certain amount of weight in size, is considered to be normal between 18,5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are regarded as obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov based 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital's data, who have gathered since 2007 in a study, compared two types of obesity surgery - stomach and gag - into medical treatment for type 2 diabetes among people who were easily overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this operation has fallen from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
What remains of BMI was that of those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments roughly in 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% of the patients in diabetes rose to 28%.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes rose by only one percent compared to only about two per cent of diabetes.
In addition, the results in blood pressure, the triglyceride and the poor level of LDL cholesterol in general in general were better in the surgical group of surgery the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood root of hemoglobin in A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin in A1c is best kept below 7 percent, writing the researchers.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin level of A1c fell from around 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical treatment group, however, it remained stable around 8 percent.
But these better glycemic control - as you reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year the Bypass surgeon group in comparison with the Gastrectomie group has lost more weight of 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg, larger reins in BMI reached 7.4 against 5.1 and hemoglobin against 5.1% compared to 2.1% against 2.1%, and they were more likely to be a complete removal of diabetes 46.9% vs. 16.7%.
While the new study does not show a survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are indications from a study of a study of heavier people in Sweden that leads to longer life, Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was obese people who underwent an obesity operation, about 29% less likely to die over the course of 15 years - a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit to the survival of the surgeon patients, Blackstone said it was calming for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
It is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is low in this lower BMI group, without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously when the patient is between 27 and 30.
I think I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously, they said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that their bodies have firmly connected to obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult to reverse it.
Love story in the Hunsrück
ES is an issue that is now being increasingly taken into account in fiction: A young woman who is unpopular and unsightly at school, and after many years she will be able to regain the courage of her youth, and she falls in love with her.
So, also in the novel published recently, we are not so fond of Luisa Binder.
In addition to the history of love, the novel should be interesting especially for Hunsrück readers, because he is playing in Langweiler and the surrounding towns.
She grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to create a literary monument to her home town.
It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the Middle East refugee crisis would be.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom during his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to studies on ethics.
He requested that, in the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also emphasised that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, but that the situation is not appropriate.
It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe, he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts in dealing with the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution.
Caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions such as real peace and real development, mainly through education, for which these Muslim countries can be created, he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
Managing The application of force has never solved these problems, he added.
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of violence, and commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attack on September 11, and revealed that the violent reaction of the US has shifted a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the solution to this problem is non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he implemented violence, and this has unexpected consequences provoked by the Dalai Lama, the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the use of children's hands over the last 4 years.
Toxic control centres in the USA report an almost 400-percent increase increase in the number of children under the age of twelve to swallow highly alcoholic handpicked infections, such as the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia Poison Center, the cases of income from the income of hand can be reported to children under the age of 12 who report toxic control centres, from 3,266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
Children coming to these products are getting more and more frequent, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room, said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends, or because it is a mutant in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectants with non-alcoholic oral water in order to obtain a tougher drink.
Younger children can be lured from attractive nozzles of the disinfectants.
One child's mind does not think that this is bad for it, said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive hand disinfectants are those that are parsed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapes and orange, which are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfection agents contain between 45% and 95% of alcohol.
Especially in the case of young children, a few spritzers can lead to the poisoning of alcohol.
It is highly concentrated on alcohol, Dr Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison notrufcenter in the hospital of the University of Kansas, told the station Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you would not let you have a slip of whisky, but people are leaving these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and if children come to it, then it is a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four spritzer from after an earthquake of scented hanging agents at school, was brought into an emergency for treatment.
Her concentration of blood was 179, twice higher than the threshold that applies to an adult as a drunk, Dr. Chris Ritchey said she treated her as an emergency doctor who treated her to the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah lallte was her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them by night in a separate child hospital on signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen by alcohol and had turned his head, said Ritchey.
It was very scary, said, said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
ES would have been fatal for my child to be fatal.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hacker infections outside the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, a number of disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand of hand infections that contained toxic, undeclared ingredients.
Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth class in New York decided to poison their work as a teacher in the United States by providing antibacterial products around the classroom, so a police report is reported.
The teacher is highly allergic to germs of hand and has them from her room.
The police regarded the foiled plan as a bargaining chip and pointed out disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In the event of an accident on the crossbar between Nordring and Herdem, a 33 year-old driver of death has been easily injured.
A 60-year truck driver drove on the cross spange towards roundabout industrial area and belatedly realized that at the roundabout there had been stopping two waiting vehicles.
As a result, he jumped to the rear of an Audi with his truck and laughs at one of the Ford Fiesta before that.
Material damage of around EUR 10 000 was added to the vehicles involved in the accident, dividing the police.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to travel and had to be thrown off.
Scaffolding kitchen: No Disharmonia near Celtic.
Griffiths is playing the talk of Disharmonie near Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that there is a poor place, but that is what he is going to do.
Hearts will fight SFA for accusations of Neilson, and Warburton will be wary of January new commitments that could destroy the caste of the caste.
Increasing leadership over Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooneys' Elfmeter in the first half of the year gave Aberdeen a brief victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons created a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths is playing talk about Disharmonia.
There are rumors about Disharmonia with Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team mates should not be under increased control, as they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch one.
I do not think we feel under pressure, I think the players look forward to this.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring by the Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers-midfielder and the former national player of the Netherlands told Ronald de Boer that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic, as there is no precedence over the title of the league.
De Boer, at present an ambassador for Ajax, said: In Holland she does not show any highlights of the Celtic-games more and why?
ES is because the Rangers are not there.
People are not just talking about the return of the league.
You talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in.
ES gives a lot of excitement in the Old-Firms, and it is not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games.
I am going to turn things around, Deila swears.
Ronny Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian chief vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit of the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen was now clearly at the top of the table with five points.
Deila said, Celtic Celtic had already had a bad time, and we will come back.
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel the same - but we must continue.
We really do need to really support Celtic, because that makes the player better.
It is so important now to unite.
Warburton on the Road of Januar-Transfer
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he attempted some transfers of January, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is wary of signing new entrants and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox Kaders.
The ex-chief of Brentford said: The January settlement window is very different from the summer window.
The players who come in summer have this advance notice to integrate what you saw with our own group during this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
The Celtic-target person, Michu, with reference to the letter
Swansea Stürmer Michu, talking to Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract ends with the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been plagued by a troublesome ankles for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Meeting on SFA-Battle for Neilson's comments
The Hearts ran 2: 1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3: 2, but the Red card of the defender was later lifted - the third Red card of collum that was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains what he said, and he insists: I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid tynecastle
After giving up a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts, Rudi Skacel, the untouchable hibee was dismissed.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment, it said, it said, it said, it is safe to say that I do not return to Tynecastle if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow.
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the board of Dundee United has confidence in the management team, but admits that it has to end on the playing field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We will bring the guys back to Trab, said Donnelly.
McInnes pleased to win Hamilton's naughty to win.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to compete desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive Liga-Sieg who brought five points from Celtic to the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said: There is no team that won everything, in posts or leagues that did not win games of this kind.
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while in the United Kingdom it is increasing.
The unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 during the period from May to July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10 000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was 5.5%, as indicated by the figures for National Statistics Bureau.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of people now employed at 2.612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter, a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said that the government's long-term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy.
It is almost exactly a year when Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment.
Drunken stormed the process
As security guards were unable to pacify the situation, the police called the police.
It was only with the use of pepper spray that the officials were able to arrest the troublemakers.
An inhalation of alcohol resulted in 0.89 promille which was 16 years old.
His mother was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and remained first in custody.
Why I am witnessing an execution in Oklahoma.
A little later today, except for late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.
When it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will sit in a gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary if Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day became closer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I voted because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
ES would offer a unique perspective.
ES is true that journalists can see executions in the United States, and since more applications are often available as seats, a mappet lottery takes place in order to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media from 12 to five.
Who is selected, it will observe it emotionally.
I cannot do that
I shall sit next to Richard Glossips's closest friend, with whom I have been going to develop my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen in order to record what I see.
I simply have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma asked me on Twitter to give up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner he wants, and you get access.
I have complained to her about this.
She admitted that she might have put it better, but she still thinks it is wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He does not tell me what I have to write, and I would not do.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that public relations with the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I made.
I shall not go into all the details again.
I cannot say that Richard Glossip innocent
His actions following the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of action.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe there is insufficient evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective I will see him dying.
I cannot claim to be really objective
ES will give other reporters to whom you can contact them.
What you will get from me is what it means to see an unnecessary death from a man.
When I try to hunt the Canning River, he is going to talk to him that he is going to hunt the Canning River.
It was also known as the Canning River police when he transferred the man of the Canning River to the Canning River.
An attempt by a man of Perth to hang off the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, a few meters from a police officer who tried to persuade him gently to return to the shore.
The police of Canning Vale were summoned to Beckenham on Tuesday for a house peace break.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape to the Canning River.
But it did not come too far.
When He stood in water and said I do not come out, come out and get me, said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about keeping his uniform wet, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - A good police officer negotiates himself.
Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape, said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins cut his car in the ditch to escape control of alcohol and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and that he threatened to stop the race.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and that he threatened to finish the race immediately.
He focused on the Stewards and Integrity Department of Racing Victoria, and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race handling, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and that he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt crowd in Lidaris, which he cannot explain
He stayed in prison for 18 months because of the espionage charges and did not want it to look like too expensive.
I had no idea to say anything about it, and I have been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything is released at once, said Moody.
You know it goes on.
Sometimes one responds and one has to live with the consequences, and I have to live what I said.
I'll go home this evening and I sleep well.
I want to walk around my head, and I want my owners to think I do my best for them.
If they start to think, I don't, then I should not be more trainer.
I then have to consider what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department tried to spy on his stall.
Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and a man who gave him an employment in my stables to supply information about what I do within my stables, said Moody on Racing.com
They seem to believe that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should certainly make use of their nases because they have failed.
Robert Roulette, Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, CEO of the RVL, was aware of this at the time and is still today.
Should this lead me to think that it is going to be personal?
Has the RVL been cowardly and perhaps makes people responsible for what is going on in industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people think outside that I am.
Perhaps they have to accept my license and be in breach of me, and I have no doubt that what I say can now be considered by them.
But I have now reached the point where I do not care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I shall put pressure on them and urge them to take a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration levels of the coach have been built with the long cobalt test at Lidari, and late scraping has said that he can cast his license over the table.
Moody, best known by his preparations for the undefeated master of black Caviar, described the race days treatment rule a ridiculous, after a packet of mud or sound was applied to the horses which was against the rules.
It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, he said.
The owner of my staff has mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
I could have heard it yesterday evening.
ES would have been the whole day as it was.
But it was also one of the reasons why it was on the day of the race.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the package on the day of the race, and an investigation of this matter has been opened.
ES is a joke.
People who set up these rules do not know about the horse.
Let us all see that we need rules, but here we go too far, Moody said.
Man to Drift Escape
On the weekend, the police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist and subsequently followed the driver's flight to Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray-Valley motorway.
The police said the driver continued to stop to help the injured driver.
On Monday a 50 year-old man from Nathalia stood in Shepparton.
He is expected to be prosecuted for the curling of drivers and for the assistance he has made and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in hospital and is in a stable state.
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer, Craig Bellamy, is beating against rivals because of claims to wrestling.
Craig Storm-Trainer, Craig Bellamy, has expressed criticism of two Premier League favourites of the NRL as part of two Premier League Favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referee with his team allowed with his team during the High Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening.
The team of Brisbane Broncos made a short comment about the storm-team after his team reached the Final-Sieg against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, calling the game a model example of the rugby league and saying that the two from Queensland are not as good as possible.
Bellamy defended his team's tack and said that she was only concentrated on her contact with her on the Tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team gives him confidence, as it means that they are worried about being beaten by the storm-team.
I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke about wrestling when it came to us 24: 2, said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything on our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year, but over the last six weeks, we have made our contact with Tackles an active priority, and this has brought us to the turn of the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he apparently has a great team to train, so he is probably not accustomed to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
ES is funny as it always appears at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea about exciting football for football, reminding her mentor that Bennett St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He played his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening, and how exciting her game was, Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he was going to worry about it.
But now he has a team who can play and which we consider to be exciting, especially among his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not each team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play as they can play.
I rely on greater confidence because they are a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they did not think of us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the Broncos game against cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I have not yet looked at it, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two other attempts at our game, but this is an exciting game?
Or are there breaks or no points?
For me it is the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will be meeting at one stage.
The storm-team is free on this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday evening in the AAMI park.
Get rid of Serbs with 200 000 dollars of bail after drug charges
A man who might have a life sentence because of his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released against a deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the droge on the yacht Solay came from South America via Vanuatu and raised in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen how he met his co-accused in the marina during the morning and later in Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of fuel in a Toyota echo.
Despite a possible punishment for trying to have a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there is no evidence that he tried to have the entire amount, and that in the café it might have been a harmless reason.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the threat of flight from Maksimovic.
It has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, he explained to the court on Wednesday.
When he was a criminal, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovics' mother and stepfather had offered a deposit of $200,000 as security in order to secure his release.
Working After reading the outrageous statements of the two people, it is clear that the requirement of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden, said judge flatter.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail under the conditions that he gives out his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police every day and stays at an exit from 18: 00-06: 00.

Pikan Hogg used telephone of girls to entice paedophiles to send images
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
When he came to Hogg, he took the phone of the girl, and ended up in an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children who had been sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the telephone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it, found the confusing messages, and alerted her mother immediately.
The police took care of them and saw the five pictures, then they then analyzed computers that were found under the address, and they used to search for real estate in question, which used the words for the search for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to officials that he had done it because it would lead to paedophile paedophiles on the Internet, and that he then pretended to be a policeman to scare her.
The prosecutor, Eilidh Robertson, told the Dundee Sheriff Court: He said it would be addictive to scare people.
He admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him, but he said it was because he wanted to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.
He was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to entice them.
He said he was ill when he drinks, and he said he would see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was to quote and cry.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Playstation used to speak to girls who looked a lot younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, was guilty of including decent pictures of children on 14 June of last year, and on 25 January of this year they have breached the requirements and have not appeared before the courts for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg does not appear in the register of sexual criminals, that it can be argued that there is no significant sexual element in his offenses.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael sent the verdict to October to obtain background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but it was held in custody for hearings on other cases.
It was included before the date of the judgment in the directory of sexual offenders.
Plunge into small border crossings with Germany.
More and more refugees are being taken up by the major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
A large number of smugglers have allowed people to cross smaller border crossings out of fear of discovery and arrest.
On the Austrian side, a spokesman for the Federal Police said.
Since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been picked up along the river Inn in the countryside of Passau and Rottal-Inn.
They were on foot of bridges and dams on the German side.
There they are taken from federal police and forwarded for registration.
On Wednesday, Munich Central Station, much more refugees arrived in line with federal police data when compared to the start of the weekend on Wednesday.
When 700 people arrived in the capital alone until 8 a.m., a speaker said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of checks on the German-Austrian border, refugees from the city reached the city on Tuesday in 1759.
Stuttgart: Track of tropical storm Henry expected in the south-west
Forecasters warn of storms in the south-west of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is entering the country, the German weather service divided DWD in Stuttgart.
The most powerful of them is the cyclone of the tropical storm, which has taken place over the last few days from the Bermuda Islands via the Atlantic Ocean.
Thunderstorms and thunderstorms are expected to take place especially in Baden.
According to DWD, until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and the seabed it is possible to expect 60 to 90 km of kilometres per hour.
So, on Friday we can see the sun again.
The mass makes a difference: Every two years on the IAA will show their news.
In 2015, there is first and foremost a move in the compact cars, which are selling well at present.
Cars in the compact class are in particular at present: Some 28.1 percent of the new registrations were included in this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA as public events take place from 17 to 27 September.
A lot of new compact models will be presented this year between futuristic concepts vehicles and new luxury and luxury cars.
One of the biggest prefixes for the German automotive industry is the Astra, which will be trading with dealers in the autumn.
The Astra is an extremely important model for us, said Opel chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the trade fair.
It is at the heart of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra will not be much more expensive.
Opel is running below the largest competitor, Volkswagen Golf, which is expected to start at EUR 17 650 million.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 Euro.
The Astra is equipped with a new 1.4-liter engine with a capacity of 74 kW.
In addition, the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW from 70 kW from 95 HP to 147 kWumen 200 HP, of which three or three cylinder liners are counted for the first time.
With the exception of the most important competitor, Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra only ranks as a fifth of them.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the Kombi, which is also visible on the IAA.
And what is going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of his Astra-competitors Mégane to the race.
At the trade fair, the Mégane is exclusively a fifth in a conventional and an emphasis on athletic GT-Version.
When it comes to trading at the beginning of next year, it is also combi.
Infiniti: New in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, the new model wants to find its position in the growing segment.
With its curved lines, the compact Infiniti fits fully into the brand's design line.
The basic model will be a gasoline engine with a power output of at least 90 kW.
On offer, however, it is also possible to have a diesel with 80 kW 109 horsepower or 125 kW with 170 HP.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also Suzuki Baleno, who is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model with gasoline engines is offered, including a newly developed (a newly developed 9 litre) engine and an output of 82 kW, 111 HP.
The maximum torque is based on manufacturer specifications for 170 new meters of power of Nm Nm.
The start of Baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: It is not entirely new, but it is completely renewed it is the compact classic DS 4, which is to be seen at the IAA.
On the other hand, the designers of the noble Citroën-Ablegers put their hands on the front part of the front: Here the front of the grill was re-drawn and the changed headlights are equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and for the first time it was integrated into Apple's.
In addition, there are a number of revisions and new variants such as the upgraded Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square metres of cell is unworthy of human rights.
The Federal Constitutional Court has given way to an ex-detainee of the office of custody, for months in a small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are placed in small cells.
This has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges who are affected, they can hope that if they are only incarcerated in confined spaces within a few days, they can expect 14 of them.
In order to achieve this, an ex-detainee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: He was placed in a single cell with about five square meters of surface area between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated in space.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, is now at liberty, has been transferred to a larger cell.
The undignified conditions of detention against the country of Berlin have failed.
However, the constitutional judges withdrew the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin in and out of the case for the reconsideration.
You see that the human dignity of the man is being violated.
Chamber Court now decides on the level of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of liability for compensation for the period in question were a few days of liability for compensation, it was said that there was a compensation.
If not, it would be likely to fear a maverick of the legal protection of personality.
The Court must now clarify the level of compensation.
In the past, the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
So they only compensate for compensation in April, because they have been locked naked in one cell.
According to a decision in 2011, the multiple assignment of a cell without a separate toilet is unworthy of humanity.
In addition, Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday that a detainee in a parallel case in November 2009 confirmed a decent accommodation.
For more than three months, the former plaintiff was placed in a similar cell from 15 to 21 hours, as well as in the case of the Republic of Karlsruhe.
The Berlin prisons have also come to the headlines in recent weeks because of lack of staff.
This is why prisoners continue to be trapped over 23 hours of age, and the aggressiveness is increasing, even to thugs, because of the tense situation.
According to the Judicial Office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied by lack of talent, and 19 are to be removed by 2016.
Angela Merkel and the policy on refugees
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What does Germany have to do?
According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to what Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel says Germany is in a position to accept one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has demonstrated a determined determination in the face of the unusual challenge: I say I say again and again: We can do this and we can create it.
What is going to happen to Germany gives the following overview.
According to various forecasts, the Federal Ministry of State estimates that the Federal Ministry of Economics and 400 000 estimates of the Pestel Institute each year - will be one of the five years to come.
This is nearly twice the amount of how it has been built to date 250000 homes.
It is true that the lack of housing is mainly due to affordable rents: Between 60 000 and 80 000 of them annually fall from the rental price, and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees.
This is why Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks wants to double the subsidy, from currently 518 million to EUR 1 billion.
This is far too little from the point of view of the plague: 80 000 social housing a year would have to be created each year, and the Federal Government would have to invest a subsidy of 6.4 billion a year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister for Economics agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Employment Research, it is estimated that in the long term 55 percent of poultry would be able to work in Germany.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualifications to help them enter the Bertelsmann Foundation, which is criticized by Claudia Walter, the project manager for integration and education.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they can work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation of the host society, but also for the self-esteem of the immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround in Germany: From the ban on refugees to the recognition of work.
Whereas in the past there was a ban on working for asylum seekers for up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the duty of residence that limits asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - a majority in society has ensured that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market more quickly.
One major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is not yet a sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts.
The structure of networks is therefore in the mind of Thränhardt of the Royal Way of Work Integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that there are only a few winged parents who spend their children in the kitas, which is estimated at 10 to 15 percent: For the parents who are uprooted, it is only very important for the uprooted parents to hold the family together, says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Senate administration of Berlin.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of Kita, the management manual is distributed in various languages.
If the needs of educators increase sharply as a result of the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity to train, for example, by allowing for more specialized schools.
In the countries, students are prepared to attend classes without the knowledge of German.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, they are also taught by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no lack of them, says Beate Stoffer from the Berlin School of Education.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20% of the refugees in Germany want to study.
As a matter of principle, there is no prohibition of any kind of state of the state - the only exception was Berlin.
Student willing refugees could be relieved of access to the university.
Because refugees with a funeral for residence do not receive benefits under the law of asylum, they will be allowed to start their studies.
The latter do not in principle receive a BAföG since they do not fall within the circle of eligible persons.
Until now, refugees who have been living in Germany for four years have had to retire from January 1, 2016 for 15 months.
This funding gap also needs to be closed, and Steffen krach, Berlin's Secretary of State for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should immediately receive BAföG.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state church law will develop into a new state relations.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic Welfare Association, which will deal professionally with the new arrivals.
Rights also include duties.
For example, the representative of Islam must agree on clear points and be willing to cooperate with the state in a number of areas, giving it certain possibilities for control.
This also involves being willing to take bold action on religious fundamentalism.
The president of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to deal with such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to be here in Germany, he said in Bavarian radio.
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
Integration will continue to be much more than today a whole society.
If this is to change the majority society, the elimination of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has been an anti-discrimination unit and a general law on equality for a short decade.
However, it is very slow when the Nazi murder series showed that the racist motive was systematically ignored in the police and authorities.
There is an equal chance for everyone: What migrant organisations and non-white interests are demanding for a long time, and why international agreements such as the anti-racism convention on racism require Germany to do so, must become reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens to take advantage of its opportunities.
In general, Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the refugees that have been expected so far.
When it comes to capacity as regards capacity and capacity, we manage to create the day, as he said to the mirror of the day.
However, additional money should be invested in the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks for all arrivals to hand out health cards during registration.
The services provided could be settled later with the federal states.
And, in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited service catalogue that the law of asylum pretends to see.
Otherwise, it is mainly the doctors who make it possible to create language barriers.
Already, so far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated that migrants are better informed than other patients about their diseases.
It is not only in clinics that, even in doctors' offices, interpretation costs have to be taken over.
However, a number of refugees would also have more universal contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic view.
For example, there is much more untreated disability among refugees, and young people are concerned with HIV.
With the sometimes different images of the disease, German doctors would come from their education but it is clear what he thinks is Montgomery.
It is not so difficult to identify parasite parasites or tuberculosis, and when it comes to the shortage of doctors, the refugees might even see relief in sight.
The Syrians would have a highly developed education system, and a number of refugees would be doctors.
If they are to be able to practice, however, they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and perhaps take examinations again.
At least half of the refugees who arrive in Germany is according to estimates of the Federal Government of the Federal Republic of Germany: BPtK is ill in terms of mental illness: Most of them suffer from a post-traumatic stress of stress or suffer from depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, declaring Dietrich Munz, president of BPtK.
A recent study by the Technical University of Technology shows that each fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Anyone who suffers from a post-traumatic stress of stress suffers from so-called flashbacks with respiratory, dizziness, heart and death fears.
Further symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, a great degree of horror, and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment declared Munz.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive a psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill people can request psychotherapy in the social services, processing takes several months.
Moreover, in the social services, professionals or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to miscalculations, Munz says.
A manege invites you to dream of a dream.
With the new staging of passion for circus, the Circus Probst takes back on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract every age group to fascinating acrobatics, animal dressings and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites to the manege on the clay to dream about it.
Love of Our passion is the circus.
I cannot imagine myself without my circle of circus without my circus, and she says Stephanie Probst, teacher teacher and June
Passion with passion - this is the motto of the current management.
For more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the family.
The gift of enthusiasm is the family in blood.
It is important for us to bring people away from their daily lives, and it is emphasised for two hours into a completely different world.
As director Reinhard Probst calls his concept, this is a question of a cocktail with a cocktail with a cosmopolitan flair.
50 towns on the nearly 3 000 kilometres of tour can experience this flair now.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from around the world.
Distinguished by the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family fascinates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their trade.
With the heroes of silent films, the Cuban duo loosely wants to record it.
Lightness and agility - they identify themselves with these words.
Your humorous art at the mast is going to conquer women's hearts by storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with a sense of sensitivity and joint determination.
With the unicycle on a ball?
There is no problem for He to He.
Fascinate and frighten people at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics than little and fascinates with her mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
The animals that belong to our family are emphasised by Stephanies' mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuses in the posture of circuses are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes a position on this: If it is not good for our animals, it is not good for us.
About 80 animals from five continents enjoy each string unit.
The four-legged artists who are known as loving will be able to read every wish they wish.
We want to work with animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel good, it does not want to be in the manege.
So it is a good thing to do well for the animals.
Especially on her zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of Shetland Ponyhengst and a zebra, the family is proud of it.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
But then, then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there, Brigitte tells Brigitte.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of Circus Probst.
So, there is something to be done for every visitor.
One of them is safe, says Stephanie Probst.
From the 17th to the 20th of September, the Circus Probst invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 pm.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is a family day, and prices are reduced for the presentation at 5 p.m..
It is also open daily from 10: 00 to 18: 00.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, dropped down from a podium at the beginning of the year.
It remained intact, but the video of the case spread rapidly via social media.
The opening of Parliament has also been tarnished by statements by Members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and that they have been warned against monitoring the address of Mr Mugabe with regard to Mugabe's death.
Last month, they left him and cut him off during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change for Democratic Change said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones, which warned them to interrupt Mugabe's address.
Moving the message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title of death 'when he said he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the MEPs who have been involved that parliamentary immunity ends, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard Must Reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of the restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will be split into two listed companies later this year, and separate the computer and printing business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and service business activities.
The expected job losses result in a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
When these restructuring measures become a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, will guide the unit after separation.
Lead Hewlett Packard Enterprise will become smaller and more focused when it is HP today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of shops that companies support when moving to a new style of business, said Whitman.
As an independent company we are better than ever to meet the changing needs of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion in annual sales and will focus on the provision of unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for companies, making it a statement of the company.
ES splits up a company that was founded in the 1930" s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment and the Palo Alto garage man named the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has gone through massive restructuring to manage the move from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The HP measure, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US high-tech companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on conviction that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal-Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand in front of the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere.
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only in September, and that when his rehabilitation runs according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play it again before Christmas before Christmas
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least one of the next four matches for England, and in view of its history, his participation in the European championship in the coming summer is still uncertain.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre-season.
This type of injury does not threaten the career of business, said Wenger.
ES is a bone that did not heal well.
This is not a bigger issue.
This was just an accident.
ES was not in connection with his dummies or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the inherent danger of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
ES also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 arsenals during the last five hours.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that in six of the eight games since 2007, they were one of the two Premier League clubs that recorded most of the infringement days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
Sometimes when you come back from injury, you have an overdue period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat force, said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body will stabilize, I am confident that he will do it and that he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season of Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger will introduce a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, meaning that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
I have tried to keep the balance, and the players who need it to allow a small pause to allow something he said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is one of the biggest intimidation effects in Europe.
Dynamic is also released after 41 matches after the invincible invincible campaign was started in the last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake, with 3.2 measured on the Richter scale.
This year was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the teaching of the past season with the Champions League of Victory against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the club to its first European triumph with its management.
If this drive is immense, said Wenger, said Wenger.
ES has never worked on Arsenal before.
We were very close to that in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in the store to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not a dreamer.
FriendsFest: The comedy show which gives us serious lessons about mens friendly men
The lack of similar images in shows is obvious, especially with regard to how the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men prove to be on a 15-year high.
In 2013 it was the most important cause of death among men from 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more frequent among women than among women.
Trying to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living miserable announced that CALM - campaign against a wretched life - would be the year of man as the year of man, with the goal of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge.
A recent survey of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with healthy mood, his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course we have to have friends first so that friendship can work.
In the era of communication via social media, with its emphasis on style via substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong, liveable and successful, even if in reality isolation is dominating.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extra-social values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has a much wider impact on our mental health.
And, like a video player inventor and billionaire a short while ago, money can really not buy luck.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on its head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which gleaned through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and chandlers frequent hugs, moments of football in cozy armchairs, and longing from Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can always refer to it, even if they often prefer to fully explore their feelings.
Like a colleague of telephone care, I explained to me how people who feel depressed and who are suicidal have a clear understanding of how the little ones who interact with friends can make a difference.
The men who contact us often feel unable to speak to friends.
The old saying of talking about it has enormous effects, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when discussing problems.
Friends is one of the shows that make sense to me when I try to offer more long-term handling mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of mens friendly.
So my objective outsider status via the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, when you visit Comedy Central Friends Fest at this weekend you can see why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk.
Or even better, if you are sitting around in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what is the difference between your friendship.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to end - all 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest.
Di Maria meets to help PSG to dismantle Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG attend to Malmö.
This is the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain launched his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria won less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champions on the way, but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their advantage when Cavani scored in the 61 minute.
With Real Madrid and Donetjor Donetsk in Group A Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they are not only looking for the qualification for the K.O.D hours, but are also an improvement on the path to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a classic of Laurent Blancs's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics who missed opportunities in front of the door, and who was later replaced by his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.
It is a good start to win 2: 0 to cause problems and relax back, but even if there are certain things we need to perfect during the season, Blanc said.
This augurs well.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we do not have one or two other goals.
After his injury he returned to one of three changes to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team. This was one of two of them on his own place against Bordeaux on the weekend, when he was released by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing has been described as the man who can take the PSG with the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he intimated why, when he ran out of Johan Wiland, when he went to Johan Wiland before going to Johan Wiland into the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, it was disappointed.
Malmö, which hit Celtic in a playoff in order to reach this stage, appeared on Anpiff with nine national players in the field, and it was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two in the middle of the middle field.
But in addition to a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed away from Kevin Trapps in the 34, she offered little in the attack.
Stattderen (also known as PSG) sometimes found himself, with some misfortunes and poor records, not least of Ibrahim himovic, who in no less than five attempts in the first half was patched and abandoned after Cavani had used it after it was restarted.
Nevertheless, he proved a great deal of skill when he put his fellow players into play, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic, who turned the Di Maria into a turning point, which was passed by Wiland in the 52 of the post.
The second goal was finally thanks to Cavani after the hour of the hour.
This ended all of the idea that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention of Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz, the final result could be kept low before replacement players Ezequiel Lavezzi was recognized at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, gave later that PSG played a class over his team, and that the Norwegian said: Running Our last Champions League match was in December last year.
We have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
Skills games are not enough.
Leave in front of Paris!
ES was a great game of them!

Xavi: PEP Guardiola prevented 2008 from becoming FC Bayern.
World and European champion Xavi has played for the al-Sadd Sports Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015.
A few years ago, a few years ago, the FC Bayern faced the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona at that time.
Eight of the champions of Spain, three times winner of the Champions Cup, two times Club champion champion, two times winner of the European Championship, one of the world champions - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
However, in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now tells Xavi that he stood before the Euro 2008 before it came out of Barcelona.
She told me that Barça wanted to sell me.
Madrid at that time won it all, we had nothing, he told us.
And that is what FC Bayern has registered.
Xavi: There was an offer of Bavaria There was an offer of Bavaria.
What do I have to say is what I was talking about?
Let us remember: In summer 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not switch
The change did not come about, however.
And the man who is decisive for this is working for the German record master: PEP Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: Barça in Barça has taken custody of Guardiola under contract and I have played a great EM.
Pep told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me.
This is something he has managed to achieve.
Who knows how Bavaria's season 2008 would run with Xavi in 2009?
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the grass, switched the Red from 4: 0, 1: 1 and celebrated at the end of the royal class triumph.
Matt Damon is playing a variety of films in film.
Matt Damon faced Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a debate on diversity, and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of the Sunday Night of HBOS Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown, when he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, was in reference to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
When we talk about diversity, do it with the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show, insured Damon.
She was shocked by what she said, and was impressed by her when she said she was going to meet her.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly-Brothers to discuss the show finalists.
I want to ask people to think about it - anyone who will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony, said Brown first.
The only black person, and she is a Nutte who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People worked for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio on the film on film; Damon replied that her regie could give something to us at the end of what we do not want.
After the debate was broadcast, social media exploded against Damon's comments against disapproval.
Twitter user Mr Pooni put his anger over the clip by writing he wrote something Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain its variety - that is SO WEISS that it hurts.
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 reweets and 4,000 Likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the teenager killed Michael Brown in 2014 by a white policeman, the Black Lives Matter movement had an effect and urged lawmakers and authorities to put an end to discriminatory practices against Fares.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
Release album still matter matter, albums have still their meaning, he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the movement Black Lives Matter released a statement, in response to the question of the Fox news personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be regarded as a Hass group.
The network Black Lives Matter is a group of love, said the guide.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule, who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already hit the Pope, it is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior Contains First Champion
Professional sports climbing and handling of Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and home to the Grand Prix of $1 million.
The contest, which closed its 7 season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the final season, two men, Caldiero and Kameramann Geoff Britten, managed to finish, until the final.
As part of the last task, climbing belonged to a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the job within the time, so he was the first athlete to finish the exhausting Phase 4 of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero completed this challenge full three seconds, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to me with E, news after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the F1 Grand Prize of $1 million.
I think it's amazing to think about it, I have never earned more than $10,000 or I have had life for life, Isaac E said!
As I cannot yet imagine how this is, the future is unknown.
The lead producer Kent Weed went to The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he ended the course first, will not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
When there is more than a finalist, it gets with the fastest time of time, said Weed.
How much the money is a wonderful prize and life is changing, it gets a great gradation.
I do not think he has any resentment about this.
He has been so happy to have done what he has done.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: If I should be defeated by someone, I am glad that it is Isaac.
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had swapped the roles.
The America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in the spring of 2016.
Passing Detroit Tigers of Minnesota Twins
Minneapolis -- The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously, they were one of the best teams in baseball, but today the Tigers are on the final league of the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but on Tuesday they played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins turned into an opportunity for the ascent within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League game.
For Detroit, albeit for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word, which was so difficult to grasp for a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories make fun, no matter how it comes, said Tiger Manager, Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon hit 13-9 for 6 times on the 1 in 1, and made it possible for three to take us.
It was his third successful start in his last nine games.
I want to finish this year a strong end of production, said Simon.
ES is hard to throw any game in the Bullpen, and so I want to go into the game.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits, and his first RBIs have been since mid-August.
ES war die erste Dreier-Hit-Spiel von Martinez, Seitdem vier Hits gegen die Seattle Mariners am 6.
It is a good thing to say: It has swung well, it has swung well, it was said, and that is what it is.
He saw it well out of playing training, it looked better out of the bullrings, and it brought it directly into play.
With three runs in the rear of the end of the seventh, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into play.
Center Field of Byron Buxton finished the Inning with a double on the left line.
Right Field of Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before he was replaced by the Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran Wall, the only man he was faced with, before the Commissioner-designate Miguel Sano, who disfigured a Two-Run from the point of view of Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final round at the second, Verhagen created the third baseman Trevor Plouffe with a double play.
ES war die in der Major League leading 27.
After Detroit added an Insurance-Run at the end of the 9th innings, the Wall made a RFC against the closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon, and reached 5-4.
However, in the case of the court of law, Sano made three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit won the start of the game by a non-moving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers reached three ranks in the first two innings against the one who had been removed from the injury list before the game after they had been missing more than one month.
I felt that it was not the beginning I wished I wanted, but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some rather good pitch because in the third inning I would create some rather good pitches in the third inning.
After they received the Leadoff-Batter in the first place, there was a single to Second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A Two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez put into play Victor Martinez, who made a single up the middle during the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 successful series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed by a single on the right created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third which ended the threat.
The Tigers scored in the second, made a one-out of Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out single of center mine by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose on 3-0.
This was a big blow, said Twins Manager, Paul Molitor.
He did not beat very well, but he caught the right spot.
Hughes was in a Pitch-Count, did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reliever right-handed A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.

Room probe Cassini finds the ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the polar bear of the Saturn Enceladus, a global ocean is falling.
This is followed by researchers from observations of the RaumCassini room probe.
This is why the Moon is easy to navigate on its track around the ring planks.
This movement is only small, but nevertheless it is too great for a single celestial body which is constant, in a communication of the Cornell University in Ithaca which is the US State of New York from Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the specialist sheet of Icarus.
Even longer, it was known that there must be liquid water under the ceiling of Enceladus.
Already in 2006, Cassini discovered Eisvulkane, the South Pole of Saturn, which discovered water vapour and ice particles, thus feeding the so-called E-Ring of Saturn.
At least at the southern pole, there must be an underground sea, and astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean has not been resolved.

Mangoes are exotic and juicy sweet.
But anyone who wants to take care of its slender line is often more likely to get out of them.
Because mangoes contains relatively much sugar - especially saccharose.
Despite this, the exotic fruits are alive: They contain B-vitamins and vitamines and C. There is a lot of Vitamin A and the test of beta carbide.
When it comes to the fruits of ISST, it supports tendons, immune systems and metabolic processes in the body.

They should be stored at room temperature and be eaten within a few days.
If you prefer, you can choose from a variety of dishes.
A mango also gives a special touch to a hearty meal.

The company has already begun with the recruitment of seasonal workers, sharing UPS on Tuesday.
It is mainly drivers who are being searched.
As early as last year, UPS increased its workforce by 95000 out of the holiday season.
With booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have taken steps to prepare for Christmas since last year.

On Wednesday and during the night of Thursday the hair dryer blows with storm force through the valley valleys.
After Thursday morning on Thursday morning, we will be crossing a distinctive cold front that will bring heavy rainfall, wind and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently on the front line of an extensive low pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest flow.
On the shores of the Alps, on the night of Wednesday the sun erupts through the valleys.

Rome now has a Martin-Lutherm Square
Knapp 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin-Lutherm Square in Rome.
In the presence of town President Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday a nameless square in the park was baptized on the name of the German reform leader.
He is now recognised as a German theologian of the Reformation as a German theologian of the Reformation.
The park is located in the heart of ancient Rome, next to the Coliseum.
The naming was requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, priest of the Evangelic-Hanseatic City in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of popes over centuries as minority have often been able to live their faith only in secret.
With the Square it becomes symbolic that its tradition of Christianity is welcome in Rome.
In 1546, Martin Luther, Martin Luther, granted himself a number of months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk around 1510.
He found the city to be a commander-in-arms at that time.
According to historians, His negative impressions were reinforced by historians in his later struggle with Rome.
Luther then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against Abbotze.
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of BIBEL
Jesus is one of the major works that Otmar Alt painted for his BIBEL.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
I would like to say something about the beginning.
No, it was not with the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning it was the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of bible stories on paper and canvas.
Seine, a language that has colorful colors and imaginative shapes, has won 75 years, but it is by no means synonymous with funny images of images.
On the contrary, this can seem rather gloomy for each of the issues.
For three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has taken a subjective artistic selection of the many issues of the book of books of all books.
Cycles are created which are devoted to topics such as cross route, plagen, bids or fatherhood.
With this he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This is true for the Luther publisher with its theological orientation as well as for Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And first of all there is the author Klaus Altepost, who has worked on the basis of painting with the respective Bible points.
He has interpreted the Bible chosen by Otmar Alt.
These texts are like a verbal mirror of the variety of painting.
They are between the original biblical note of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist, forming his very personal thoughts on the particular situation.
The jewellery has golden letters.
This is how the 75-year-old can enjoy a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the cause of the Bible project: Otmar Alt, in 1940 in Wernigerode, grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the rigorous Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
As it happened with the pipe, Otmar Alt was reminded of it.
I have tried to work on it, so that I can perhaps also work with the Father with the Father.
His second concern is to increase the importance of art in fast-paced times: The perception of image worlds is now characterized by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is becoming urgent.
Artists have a different desire to show things.
Pictures always have a mystery and they are not decorative.
In this respect, I am a dinosaur.
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to fall in into the pictures and let them appear on their own, and they discover what power they have: The image is looking for the image itself is looking towards.
Klaus Altepost stopped on Tuesday during the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Old Foundation, and he has always been able to be a lover of Otmar who is rich in art: I like how he perceives life with his pictures.
Alt did not care that the BIBEL fully captures the BIBEL, but that it is selected for important and mysterious topics that are important.
If you are looking for an answer to your question, please contact us.
For Hans Möhler from Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to deepen his life and find freedom.
Otmar presents content of images of the Biblical language of love and responsibility.
A part of the original - both the paper and the canvas - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Old Foundation.
Beginning the Beginning of BMX Railway
Plans, space, found companies, earth guards modeled for a round course: One year later, nearly everything was ready - but this ended again before the official opening of the BMX railway.
Negligence in politics and in administration has resulted in drowning, especially when it comes to the residents who do not want to tolerate the railways.
So it is looking for new ground, with formal planning and a request for building permission.
The authorisation will be received in October, and the First Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was able to inform him in the Committee on Youth, Youth and Youth.
I hope that this year still visible, she said.
ES should then start without a further memory pause to start with the work of the former indoor swimming pool.
DFB intensifying its commitment to refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees up to 2019, and it is a clear sign on the weekend.
Football is responding to the worsening situation in Germany and the policy to help to resolve the problems that are facing us.
I think that is the greatest challenge for our country since reunification.
I have nothing to say in principle, but I have nothing to say I have nothing to do with this.
"This is something I would like to know," says Wolfgang Eichsbach, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Germany.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
I am next Wednesday in the chancellery office and meet the state minister, Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor.
Since the topic will certainly play a central role, he announced.
It can and will help football.
However, it is crucial for policy to take place.
This is why the German Football Association has extended its Refugee Initiative 1: 0 of a welcome extended by four years.
We have ensured that, through the Egidio Foundation, this programme will continue until 2019, declaring kidney stream on the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian in Malta.
There are also a number of governors who support this programme.
As early as this weekend the 36 professional associations show a clear sign when they help on the left of the trimmer instead of the usual sponsor Hermes Hermes to help the pressure We help.
We want to make it clear that we want to make it clear that everyone is supposed to help, and where and how they can do so, Rudi Völler told Rudi Völler, who took part in the project, when he said that he was going to take part in the project.
The tragedy of the tragedy of refugees goes to everyone, and no one can see.
Let us take control of football players, no, we have to use our jet force, our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so much to suffer, said Hertha manager, Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a prominent sign of the league.
As part of the EM-Qualification game against Hungary on this Friday, the national team of women is inviting 100 refugees to Halle.
Niersbach identified the support of refugees as a major joint project of German football in German football.
That all 36 licensed clubs in their locations had started their own projects is great.
It is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active.
The Embassy 1: 0 for a welcome we have spent is lived in football.
This is something that is of enormous importance, he said.
In this year and next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, has made EUR 300 000 available for the integration of refugees.
As the clubs have already retrieved the entire sum for 2015, Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP executive chief loses an eye in the event of an accident.
Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reported a number of reports that the left eye of the beginning of July has lost the left eye.
When he died in the United States after midnight during the accident in his brother in the USA, he dropped to a water glass in the United States that he was wearing in the left hand, reporting the week of economic week on Wednesday.
If He is almost verbed, it was powerless, it has then passed away to the street - that's why he told us so last week, he quotes the WiWhere WiWhere SAP co-founder of Hasso Plattner.
However, McDermott can do his job.
At the beginning of October we meet before the supervisory board meeting in Walldorf, said Plattner.
The 54 years old manager is fully operational at the meeting.
In an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung, McDermott announced that he would return to Germany in October to return to Germany and continue to run the software company.
I am full of SAP, full of my job.
Of course, I was of course all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and the chairman of Hasso Plattner, he said, McDermott said the same.
McDermott usually commences between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer present at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important for him to go to the public with such a personal history, he said the manager of the product: Everyone can pass through that.
The location of the hotel is excellent.
McLaren-replacement pilot pilot magnet other than fighting combat
Magnet twitched a photo and explained that he suffered injury when he crashed from the wheel.
So, when he retires from Singapore on the weekend, he is as little as a reserve driver for the two half of Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as happens a week later at the Great Price of Japan.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in Tor.
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus were finally crushed in the first group game of the Europa League.
The national player will also be released on Thursday with the FK Krasnodar in a duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday at 7 p.m
Unfortunately We cannot resort to him, said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday, said Thomas Tuchel.
Whether Reus will be back again on Sunday in the federal league against Leverkusen, the BVB-coach left open: We expect him to return to his training on Friday.
In view of the heavy burden of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his Stammelf on the Reus-Position.
So he announced a change on the grid position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes up the place of regular owner Roman Bürki.
He trained on an absolute top level, the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, whether Weidenfeller is being used in future in all Euro-Atlantic matches, Tuchel was open.
With a high probability he will also play the second game.
If you want to know what he wants to do, you should know that he doesn't know what he is looking for.
I think I think we have a good opportunity to take the title.
Robot Cars: Government wants to Lead Germany
In accordance with the will of the Federal Government, Germany is supposed to be at the forefront of changes in the motor of technological leadership.
On Wednesday, the Federal kabinett adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt with a coalition of people who, among other things, are investing in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Automesse IAA from a new mobility era for mobility.
Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety, and for less, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasises the importance of mobile broadband and a rapid transition to digital radio.
A test on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for the testing of new technology.
In order for the driver to bear no additional liability risks imposed on the driver, the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework conditions and adjust to new developments where necessary.
For example, Germany wants to ensure internationally that the maximum limit for self-driving cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to promote an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only includes people as drivers.
When it comes to automated driving, the car is increasingly taking over, and the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data quickly.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics, it is technically possible to carry out highly automated driving on motorways by 2020.
Nevertheless, drillless vehicles on public roads are only expected to be expected well beyond 2020.
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated chassis performance at Germany will estimate the authors of the study in 2025 to around EUR 8.2 billion.
The digital networking of passenger car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport, said the SPD-transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data must clearly be clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars as skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey presented on Wednesday by the Forsa-Institut on behalf of the Forsa-Institut on behalf of the Prüm Institute comes to the conclusion that only 8 percent of Germans believe that autonomous chassis cars will be enforced in the coming decade, 32 percent in 20 years do not expect 31 percent.
In France, 21 percent of respondents up to 2025 expect autonomous cars, 33 percent in the United States.
In any case, German drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-propelled vehicle.
After a survey of the digital association Bitkom, only seven per cent would agree to control the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, it is possible to imagine 15 percent of what is going to be flowing, compared to 45 percent in Stau.
Each of them would not leave the car under control under any circumstances.
Boll says Team- and Double start with table tennis at table tennis from now.
Düsseldorf wants to compete in the title fight from 25 September to 4 October of October.
The final decision will be taken no later than 22 September.
This is a huge loss for our team.
What do the guys know about it in the morning?
Although we are strong enough, even without having to win the title, even without Timo, the German coach Jörg Roßkopf said we were talking about it during the CeBIT exhibition in Düsseldorf.
At this point in time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsorship of sponsorship in China.
The 34 years old German Master is expected to be expected on Friday.
Working without Timo is the disadvantage, we are now no longer such a clear favorite it is, declared individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who directs the betting list to Yekaterinburg, also reminded us of the EM of Euro 2013 in Schwechat.
At that time, Timo was also missing, and we became Europe's champions.
We should orientate us, we should orientate ourselves, the world ranking was able to guide us.
The English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has taken a heavy injury to his right leg.
With the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was taken to a Tackling by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated that during the 20 years of baseball in Bastian they dropped on a track.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant awful.
ES is a mixture of very large fashion shows and a juniper Gruselkabinett: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier has presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: Mannequins which look scary thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonnas, which was the big star of the fashion scene.
I can no longer say that I am Enfant awful of Haute Couture because I have white hair.
Previously it was light, now it is real, Gaultier said.
For the visitors of the exhibition From The Sidewalk To The Sidewalk To The Catwalk, From the sidewalk From the sidewalk to the catwalk to the catwalk that can be seen from September 18, at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a SCHAU about his person.
In fact, he was against it, because: A show for me sounded a bit of death after death, he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been collected in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris.
"There is so much more than just fine clothes, said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into what is hardly yet one of the work of the man who wrote the fashion story without ever having completed an apprenticeship.
Chronologically the SCHAU is not built, but it is an excellently choreographed work of art, for which a lot of effort has been put in place: In order to spend the dolls, a stylist has been engaged.
14 tons of material have mapped to Munich according to the curator, Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was still a special delicacy: A leather healer outfit with corsett.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women as women are more interested in women than men, and for people who are a bit different, said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer's first tentative, fashionable steps.
When he was a child, he was not a good student, and in football he drew his teddy BHS and clothes, saying Gaultier.
His parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll.
He later taught himself how to make use of fashion.
He rose fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers like Gaultier in Munich.
Later on, though, I bought it of course.
For his first own fashion show he was unable to pay the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Lecturer as fashion niche
In the past it went to the long embroidery machines in and around talking to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers who, for example, have been processed into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works anymore, Andreas Reinhardt, manager of the world of fashion, explains how to chat.
This is important when it comes to fashion.
In the early days of talking, fashion played a greater role, was then driven by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt lists a few examples: Lace in jewellery, accessories like bags and regional costumes.
What is more, the so-called vintage fashion, which is attached to past styles, is more productive.
Anyone who does not use niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us they already make up half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Modespitze is a member of the industry association of talking tips and embroidery.
They can only carry the protected label.
Over the last 15 years, around 80 percent of turnover has been lost.
There is almost no more for private trade or wholesale trade.
Our products are hardly yet to reach to our customers.
Today, the mass of goods is produced much more cheaply in Asia and almost exclusively driven through chains.
Moreover, exports weaken, from now to Russia and the US.
So, sufficient reasons for new ground.
The industry association is also trying to identify with environmental awareness how Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein: Since this year we have a quality seal, it shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable production.
Reinhardt is supplemented: This also relates to the materials used.
Diplomdesigner Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger outsider of the Westphalian university of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from Asia, we need to find high quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
ES develops a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies which first need to think economically, says Schmidt.
This is why an existing design will often vary only slightly in order to keep a client base.
A few years ago, Kati Reuter, textile designer of textile design, relaunched the historic pyramid.
At the same time, the machine sticks to small chests in some parts of the machine.
It was inspired by Bianca Hallebach-Krauße, who was in charge of gold: First I could not start anything with a traditional line of talking.
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
Many people of the region identify themselves with the subject of talking - young and old people say Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, to Australia and to Finland - especially to clients whose ancestors have lived in fun and surroundings and who wish to be one of them.
By doing so, I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the head of talking.
Disney plans to present new life of Mary Poppins In Film
You don't want to mix them, but Disney still dares a new film of his classic car, Mary Poppins.
However, according to the Personal Weekly, it does not involve a new filtering, but a kind of continuation which is playing 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
ES deals with the experience of Nanny with the Banks of the Banks in the time of the Great Depression in England.
Anyone who plays Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already firm: Rob Marshall, last with the studio Into the the Woods in the cinema.
XI urges the wider economy to be opened up to the world.
The economy needs to be more open to external growth in order to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday a group that was charged with steering the reform.
China should commit to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving the strategies for business start-ups, he said in a speech at the 16 meeting of the central leadership group for deepening a comprehensive reform.
Promoting start-ups and promoting reform will bring new impetus and vitality, and deliver new ground for economic growth, telling Xi.
The management group has adopted a series of directives, including a negative list for regulating market access, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state-owned enterprises, private capital, including private capital, and the re-establishment of the residence system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created, identifying sectors and companies that do not qualify for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role to play in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment, and making the market more open to the market, said the statement.
The government will also relax controls over the powers conferred upon companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct business.
The statement also states that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
Further areas of private investment will be opened up as part of a supply to open up state-controlled sectors.
The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment, and it will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged businesses and deliver better services for them, said the statement.
In addition, it makes it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card, by optimizing the requirements and making the application process easier.
The right of lawyers to exercise their activities and use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also included Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
The EU wants to double mercury levels in predatory fish;
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in major predators and give consumers a much higher dose of the nerve.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, who has a working paper from the EU, criticized the plans sharply: Risks and side-effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy are passed on with the full force of growth of pregnant and toddlers, declaring Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, for economic reasons, should be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predators today are so strong about mercury that, on the basis of the remaining limit values, about 50% of catches should not be sold.
Once the limit was doubled, it would be only 14.5 percent of UNVERKÄUFLICH.
In exchange for this relaxation, according to the Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten limit values for other fish from today 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch described this as a simple trick, because smaller caribfish, like carp, are usually so low that they are already complying with the maximum they want to see.
The reduction in small-scale is therefore a perfidious ploy which alone helps the economy, explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans and which is heavily enriched by the food chain, especially in predatory fishing.
This is why the Federal Government warns that already low quantities can cause damage to the nervous system's nervous system.
The Federal Ministry of Environment declares on its home page that it does not expect to see a health hazard for the general population.
Above all, mercury enters the environment as a result of the incineration of coal.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment, the German coal-fired power stations emit more than six tons of mercury in the year, two-thirds of the total emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for instance, in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, is permanent and extensive, and the mirror quoted the paper from paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most widely reported health risks in the EU RASFF system.
Foodwatch calls on consumers to protest against what the EU plans to do about EU plans.
