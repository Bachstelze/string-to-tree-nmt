the prime ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new prime minister, Narendra Modi, is taking his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko to discuss economic and security relations during his first major foreign visit since his victory in May.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to cement economic relations with the world's third largest economic nation.
Plans for more nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a treaty to combat defence cooperation between the two nations.
Police from Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after rapid motorcycle hunt
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it up 125 mph in a 70 mph zone and through bushland to escape police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha were trying this morning to stop a blue motorbike after they watched it, as it left 125 mph at a gas station on the Bathdate Road.
Police reported that the driver then ignored the stops and continued on Burgess Road before turning to the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who described the driver's description were seen later at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha's police are accused of a 20-year-old man of non-compliance with a stop as well as reckless driving.
He is due to appear before the District Court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster charged over hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read out the charge at a hearing from the High Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, slept, and no consent could signal."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the hearing date for November 17 at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Retreating to the very American Ideal of Labor Rights as Human Rights
Congressman Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish unions' organization as citizenship law.
"As unions die, the middle class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud, together with the civil rights activist John Lewis, that the Staff Regulations Act.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination against the organization of trade unions, such as in other forms of discrimination, and stops such anti-union forces.
The addition of the National Labor Rights Act to create a possibility of discrimination against workers in the organization of a trade union representation in order to sue a civilian court for justice - and to obtain compensation or criminal charges - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of her bill propose is the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have been facing in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognise and expand labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of assembly in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy would replace Hedki Tojos with democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions have a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "workers" rights to union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pushed the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize, and their voice in the new nation should rise, the Germans included a clause that explicitly stated, "The right to set up associations in order to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every job or trade.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to diminish it are null and void; targeted measures are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, drafted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors gave a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form unions to protect their interests or to join them."
For generations, Americans have been accepting the basic idea that labour rights are human rights.
As this country berated other countries into how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to the establishment of a union - and that this union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with businesses and government bodies - must be protected.
After these rights have come under fire in America, it is very wise to remember the American ideal, as a result of which the working people must have the right to unite and to be listened to in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. fifty years ago said:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement does not constrain the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for the industry and raised the entire nation towards unimaginable production levels.
Those who attack the work don't forget those simple truths, but the story preserves them.
History recalls, and we should do that.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and enhancing the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee unions - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that made America great in the past and ignited the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily halts law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to shut down
A U.S. federal judge temporarily halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, telling lawyers that it was likely to lead to closure of all of the state's five abortion clinics.
This measure, filed by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, filed for law in June and is due to enter into force on March 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient's real estate in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice.
However, the judge's decision means doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being, while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs may continue to work legally while trying to obtain those rights," federal judge John degravity said in its ruling.
Within a month, a hearing will be held for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the most recent in a string of rulings against similar action, and said doctors were wrangling so much time to gain hospital approval rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are going to miss a back-breaking law that wants to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed in the name of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling also applied to doctors from the two clinics that did not join the lawsuit and had also requested referral rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for unconstitutional.
Key bodies of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the clinics left in the state to shut down were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologians, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that the deportation rights of doctors demand unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion opponents believe that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient recognition rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to do no more abortions, this doctor for fear for his safety would no longer perform the surgery, the group said.
In their arguments against the ruling, Louisiana State officials said they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patient consent were still pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates by ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have filed a video watch for their mother online, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUTHE: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the women's medical care over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosing, the type of ovarian cancer, existing precincts, as well as social and economic status, also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the diagnosis time, the rate of survival was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk was 20 percent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why outside the city women died with a higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan assumed a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for doing so.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counter the distances, it proposed a reinforcement of the service of frozen doctors as a possible remedy for giving specialists the opportunity to supply women more closely to their homes, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of the geographic status, the study showed poor long-term obesity rates among women in ovarian cancer, and underlined the need for better treatment and care strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto's Ride to Conquer Cancer, is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret falling home ownership
The drop, combined with an increased singleton of the number of homeowners under 35, could cause garden centres to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers, according to a study of the HTA, reported in the Financial Times, reach the "core age-group for gardening products."
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people spend with homes for their garden.
The rise in people living in highly urbanised neighborhoods without gardens, the popular procedure, pre-kindergarten to tarmac and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which valued at £5 billion a year in sales.
In the London area, where over a period of 6 years the proportion of home owners have fallen from 61 to 43%, the least amount of expenditure on garden products per household will be reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living up to rent or small gardens does not mean that people can't pull plants.
Guy Barter, boardroom consultant for the RHS said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants along with a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail market due to rising homeowners' pay and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He predicted this year's improved market situation because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April of last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the cleric Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, about 1,000 protesters have grabbed the state TV station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers were able to push protesters back from PTV buildings.
The station set up its business for about 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, about 3000 protesters were trying to enter the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away they were armed with sticks and stones armed with security forces.
Police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif's resignation, but this rejects it.
Meanwhile, the country's army is urging a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using force without violence."
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday night, the military announced: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already raced more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Premier Sharif of cheating in parliamentary elections last May.
The protests were escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to invade Shariff's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomat for espionage report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the country's longest-serving U.S. diplomat to testify in a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the business associates of the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel, as well as the online magazine The Intercept, reported that the former U.S. analyst at the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a main course of action for the U.S. and British intelligence agencies.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said that all major countries spied each other.
A previous report that even the most important secret service was targeted by Germany's Ankara led to sharply disgruntled reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning: Train drivers face consequences for commuters
The Local Government warning for the Local Government on Monday evening could also affect the movement of persons in NRW.
The outposts announced for 18 to 9pm nationwide were all transport companies, including highway, regional and suburban traffic, including

The district president of the German locomotive driver (GDL), Sven Schcenter, was in Düsseldorf.
We are counting on significant failures.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimise the effects.
The GDL did not say, however, where it wanted to strike, so it was hard to anticipate the consequences specifically.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
The prosecutors filed evidence Friday of the attorney's office of Mallorca evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the town of Calvià.
The head of Calvià's police station on holiday island Majorca has been arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and barowners in the notorious binge-drinking hotspot, Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro has been remanded in custody after allegations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the road where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf lie.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, prosecutors laid out evidence of extortion by police officers and police officers from the town of Calvià, according to the prosecutor's office for the fight against corruption in Majorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption charges and are being interviewed jointly with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the disgruntled night utility owners testified that the authorities' cronyism had serious implications for their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Let's get our livelihoods out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer because of a viral YouTube video, in which an 18th-century British tourist showed up to 24 men during a sacking Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-fuelled pub.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatiovorcase was held, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the pub pent-up organizer Carnage must pay together a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of the "Balconing," where people jump from a balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather affects flights from Adelaide Airport
Spring has spawned a wintry surprise, with strong swings and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening to 9pm, other 5mm rain fell on the town, after 6.6mm, which had already gone down on the night of Sunday.
The final rainfall was the result of a string of short, stormy showers, including a dining table that started just before 8pm and caused almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week for an early dose spring, temperatures in the city fell back to a high of only 15.8 ° C on Monday.
The bad weather has probably led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land shortly after 19.30, but was hit by a headwind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to be launched.
Winds hit some 50 mph on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the plane also had to get through on a second landing and eventually set up about 20.40.
The flight delays resulted in the delays of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible spectacles.
Matthies thinks it's high time for the big bang
In the face of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our cosy home into high-tech switching powers, our columnist Bernd Matthies is trending with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
While I'm writing this here, my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is one reasoning behind this: If the cable was not, in the shortest time, all the listeners would be able to fly around the house and that would be much more retro.
Anyway, is the eceltronic (eceltronic?
No, typos: Electronic) is the rule that the world's novelty of tomorrow's electric waste is bought - outdated.
And those who, for example, still have a television screen in the living room today, who simply says that they reject television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressure of the Ifa on the radio tower in this week takes us back to our absolute incompetence in the field of electronics.
The Laie, who has previously been blind to washing machines and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread with unfathomable expert talk in front of him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, go still?
What are we supposed to be talking about with people who seem to want to spread such weapons voluntarily?
In fact, it has been about 20 years since we wanted to link our house together.
So that the yoghurt itself reorders so that the fire alarm in the Maldives tells us that it burns in the work room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we checked out of the office from the air conditioning on our early arrival?
Yes, however, this presupposes an air conditioner.
But a dream is soon to come true: We lift our wristwatch, say loudly "Saugen!" - and at home, the vacuum cleaners drive away.
Misleading.
Everything runs out to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred," raunt a branch of industry, one can combine the washing machine with a headphones, the steam garer sends the weather report and the data goggles show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but that does not use anything because we are standing in the traffic jam.
We also know from daily practice that if a newly modified device is really needed, the battery is empty.
What another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas close to the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters, while missile and mortar shells fell to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and shut down the schools in Gaza while the area was recovering from the fighting.
The school start brought a sense of joy and anticipation to the communities marked by rocket launchers in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, staff at the Pashosh kindergarten, hit by a rocket, were taken out of the walls and gunfire before meeting the students grenade launchers.
"We're a little bit afraid, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, residents in the kibbutz Saad and there's English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a little weird" suddenly going back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we weren't out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until an armistice broke the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad broke into their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still reluctant to return.
The Department of Education said that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were initially housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town on Gaza that is struggling from the Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children, much to learn and said "we will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and provide security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite cease-fire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire ensured an immediate end to the fighting; major problems remain unresolved, however, as Hamas's demand for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and seaports in Gaza.
Israel is demanding that Hamas disarm and surrender the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these claims and estimates that at least half of those killed are militants, but did not provide any specific evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during fighting on Israeli towns, most of them in the country's south.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 aerospace and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gazan area and about 250,000 people searched for refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were rebuilt in temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues, education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope the school is reopened soon so we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxons, CDU-Vize Strobl challenges NDP banning
In the face of the failure of the NPD in Saxony, CDC official Thomas Strobl voted for an end to the current NPD prohibition against the German Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDC subprime minister Thomas Strobl, there should be an end to the current prohibition against the NPD before the German Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is cutting worse off than last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU chief in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipzig People's newspaper."
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to be able to fight the NPD politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD were very close to the five-per-cent hurdle in Sunday's vote.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party failed in 2003 because, at the time, the protection of the constitution in the NDP led to an informant.
In December 2013, after long preparations, a new application was submitted in Karlsruhe.
The federal government and the Bundestag did not agree.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the end of the day, refugees are now housed in tents.
The headquarters initial reception for refugees in Harburg bursts from all seams.
Now, the Home Office has set up three tents of the Red Cross.
The district politicians have been informed shortly before - they are unenthusiastic.
"These hauroo actions continue to stoke citizens" reservations and not give the regional leaders a chance to cooperate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says about Britta Herrmann, leader of the Green group in the district of Hamburg.
Their party demands that the district administration of Harburg currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overcrowding in the initial recording are the rush of helpings - and the fact that authorities can't provide enough seats in subsequent facilities.
So many refugees remain for longer than the regular three months.
House prices have seen the strongest winter growth in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data released Monday.
This increase is the overall increase in June, July and August at 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tier market.
Figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose 16.1 per cent in Melbourne last year, up 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six per cent respectively.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless said further that with spring training now for the next few months, an increase in the real estate market would be subject to "a real test."
"If you look at the ongoing high rates of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the continued low ownership environment, it's likely that home prices will rise further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion issued to the New Press, he disagrees with statements from the leader Peer Medau and attests to posing "like a field master."
The College's style is not, it says in the note.
As a result, the Medau family had already been informed "in the middle of June orally about the idea of the university.
The statement that the plans were first announced in July is definitely wrong," Prichtl added.
At the same time, it points out that the plans are not "preconceived or even decisions," but that there would be "preferences."
Even the necessary extension of the narrow road leading up to the castle is less dramatic than that of Medaus.
Of a nine metre long road, and is not the talk.
It goes after current levels of 5.50 meters, which is a metre wide than before," Pnehl explains.
The Medau-operator's argument that their free and schooled parking spaces are now only being used by students from college students does not wish to apply.
It is not possible at all because, as with other public car parks, this can be intelligently resolved.
Thinking of residents
The children's crawl, which is located on the premises and on its doorstep, would lead to access to the parking deck should be "not affected," according to the university's president.
In fact, he has to bear in mind that this is not just about children's cribs, but also about residents living at the residence of the Friedrich-Stering street and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring secondary school.
So it's all about much more of Mr. Medau's vested interests," Prichtl added.
Whether or not the critique of the parent's advice of the children's crawl, with the expansion of the road would be entitled "the few untreated spots of Coburg to be lost" is entitled "can the reader decide."
At the beginning of October, Pamazl, together with the State Building Office of Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the construction development of the university by 2020" and, in this context, to address the importance of the new development."
Peer Medau last week briefed the children's parents about the college's plans.
Therefore, road access for the new parking deck is not supposed to take place across the campus and the Friedrich-Stering street, rather than the Medau-Berg.
In this way, the narrow road would have to be extended to about a kilometre in length.
According to projections made by Medaus, traffic in the Park of Hohenfels Castle would increase.
There is talk of approximately 2000 vehicles every day.
It was not possible to comment on the project from the point of view of the city.
Glandorf resigns from handball football team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old member SG Flensburg-Handewitt led the decision in particular to health problems.
The decision hasn't been easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," the 2007 world champion said on his Facebook page.
It follows a balance sheet of 167 countries and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement.
Because the massive backroom players for Champions League winners from Flensburg will want to go on goaltender for a few years now, he is no longer available to the new German coach, Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf led a "long and good conversation" with the Icelanders, who announced his cadence of the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and ideas have been as enthusiastic about me as they will inspire my longtime players and my successors.
But for my club I want to be healthy in the years to come, and longer periods of regeneration are necessary, which do not permit the current double charge.
The left-hander had to fear his career in 2012 after a heel infection.
Because of Achilles problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German handball bunting (DHB) with a cortisoninjection, which later triggered strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, who ended the confrontation with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team work don't walk away at any body.
I have some health work sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three inflators that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never really managed my blood pressure.
In this connection, a number of other wearable complaints come about.
Even at the beginning of the year, I noticed that while I'm steering my head, but my body can't fool," Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine "Handball Time."
For a comeback, he would be available only in absolute emergency.
"When all stripes tear, I'm always talking," explained the two-time family friend to the trade magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I became pretty humble about my health.
After my career, I want to be at least reasonably straight.
In addition to the World Championship in 2007 and winning the Champions League in 2014, he took the EHF trophy in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he secured the European Cup winner with Flensburg.
German economy shrank by 0.2% in spring
The crises around the globe slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
The German Statistical Office also confirmed the preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
External trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual takedown of the first half of the year, there is a 0.8% GDP increase compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the "Münsterland Mooiste," which took place on Sunday for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar witnessed an invasion of Dutch "Fiber riders" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, held the so-called "Münsterlande Moolist."
It's all about the biggest bicycle ride across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
About 1000 participants thanked for the organization of this tour through the Münsterland with their registration at Jos.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and are driven overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland even this kind of way," frets the cyclists over the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the clubhouse of the trenchant "Sta."
Katharina was referring to a small "peace drive" through the city over the Wall, where even the launch was made.
Further the route, advertised for three different categories, headed towards men's wood over the Schöppinger Mountain in the direction of Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 km with 1175 height meters, 120 km with 1475 meters and 145 km (145 kilometers) with 1775 elevation, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were transported along the road in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer Jos ter Huerne and Mayor Heinz Lölfingen were delighted with the success of this bike event.
We're happy and it's been a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization proceeded without problems and there were no adverse events," notes Heinz Lölfing a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, there weren't as many participants as the organiser had hoped for what was probably due to poor weather forecasts and morning rain.
"We are again looking forward to happy weather on 30 August or another weekend in 2015, but the cyclists were able to return to the Münsterland and the organisers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin wake-up call ruthlessly honest memoir
It's actually more philosophical testimony than biography, what Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, politself activist, ex-detainee, has put in "monk and warrior" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically but more thought networks for thought nets, the Munich born on June 1, 1947, wrote his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a matching song text.
And he is ruthlessly honest: From Onanie as a high school until shoplifting and drug use, he makes no human weakness.
Also, in order to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also take abstract, but even more important terms, a: Love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all trying to go to very philosophical, but also a very personal way.
And he also elucidated his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and, as he was not only influenced by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter brought the Lebman Constantine Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is "by subtraction," as he says, "by leaving everything necessary."
There are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the highly intellectual views: About thugs in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, where he targeted a tree.
Here, too, he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My dad never took me in the arm.
Has never said 'I love you'
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry rehearsed for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just heard his voice: "Listen with the collar.
Let your sister rest in peace.
Beway you!
I want to watch cricket.
My elderly brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already growing up when I was a child - went to the pub and talked about things, such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket bat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner that read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at times his father, he won an insight into how life had been for him.
It's slightly brighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep stylized labyrinths with flame wounds and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to be in the tub sooner and then he was able to hear him slowly as he began to sing, because he was able to wash the foundry.
When I ran around there, it became clear to me that he had done so for years to put the food on the table and my respect for it was greater.
Still, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love of gifts.
My dad never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
It was only when my mother went against the end of her life, we began to say "I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missing as a child.
Could you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop trying to hug me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still true with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henling's own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "you need to be radical.
So I pulled out this gym and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henling's career shifts may be in his elegant, short-cut bart.
Since being lauded by the critics for his Othello, he is captured by the theater.
It was followed by the comedy of the aberrations, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies who filled out his busy working life.
He started with just 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ spotted him onstage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies, "I was in the only black Imitator/comedian on TV for a fairly long period of time."
He learned in the profession.
I didn't just have to be great in front of the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985 learning how I could become an efficient cheeky narrative machine while I was a star by the television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager possessed the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel show, an easy entertainment program in which people became "black," Henry introduced his comedy over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I somehow wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a weird, awkward position for me, but I worked on giant projects with and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures showing British black culture both poached and celebrated, Henry worked in an alternate comedy circle in the Eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry show went on show in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as the head chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series boss.
Advertising, documentaries, TV shows and film roles marked his next decade, but according to his BBC series, LennyHenry.tv, 2008, he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels all the way you just spend the time around or stand a little in the spot."
After that, a documentary series for Radio 4 came with the title What's So Great About?
The first episode revolted around Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was downright allergic.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and held him mostly for a domain of the middle class, whites in tights and a cabbage head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "you should try it.
Don't do badly if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words into your mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare.
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos's final speech for the documentary on and he was thrilled.
I felt that I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally set my head up properly.
"This is what it's all about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, keep your text, searchers a bit.
The samples were brutal and I read that piece of months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that simply did not happen.
And soon, he appeared in the comedy of aberrations.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed you."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me" you have to bridge 10 minutes while repairing the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked from the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
That, too, came along well, so it's like a big sign of the gods telling me "The here is your provision."
He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.
So I stand by it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry, though, still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is crisscrossed by humorous outbursts while always imitating people.
I decided not to make a standout comedy because I find that this kind of instant gratification from one room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're looking for that forever, you drive in front of a wall.
I sometimes live in the Apollo live when I want to do so, but overall I don't have as much as they used to be.
I ask him if he's ever going to make a standout comedy tour.
The fun I got in a room with a director helping to shape a start, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm happy to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital, Sanaa.
Huthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Huthi-Party said "Ansar Allah."
The road access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper, The Post newspaper, Huthi-leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for action on Sunday night.
Huthi threatened with another escalation of the conflict, according to the rule, should his demands not be met.
The Shiite Huthis fight for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for less than two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps at the large access roads because of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, there is always bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to curb "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun registering all state officials biometric to erase "ghost workers" from the government's payrolls.
Staff who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government notification.
The government suspects that thousands of people still receive payouts after their departure from public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to fight corruption in public service when he took office in 2013.
During an audit early this year, it was found that at least 1 million ($700,000) a month were lost to payments for "ghost workers" and by other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid in accounts after a person has died or leaves public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital, Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres over the next two weeks to ensure their data is recorded via biometric registrations, in a government message.
Anyone who did not without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the announcement continued.
"By this approach, it is essential to rationalise the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also clearing the payroll at both levels of government - so the "ghost workers" are being eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of devolution and planning.
The scandal over the art adviser Helge Achenbach is being negotiated in court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi Gründers Theo Albrecht, are demanding $19.4 million in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at Düsseldorf.
A court spokeswoman was told Monday.
In the chants, Achenbach cheated at the purchase of artworks and old-timers, and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the commission agreed would be higher.
Achenbach purchased value items for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children Need Roots and Wing
Forty-eight years he was in the school service, including 23 as school leaders.
From that time, Manfred Richter knows many established Petershausens and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods have sometimes been unconventional, but have always been worn by his quest to see in the student's mind.
The snow is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his homeland.
Richter was born in Trautenau/North Bohemia in 1930, now Trutnov.
Already with 14, he became interested after four years of high school for the teacher job.
One year later, Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within a half-hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a couple of months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946.
So did judge in the upper Franconian Senkendorf.
Teachers' education took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometres a week to the nearest station, with the train to Bamberg, three kilometres across the whole city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleep opportunity in a Rot-Kreuz-Home in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 students in a dormitory.
In 1951, he became the first official and in 1954, after three years of teaching assistants.
As Oberfranken had no free teaching job for him, he went to Oberbayern and arrived at the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "milling room" room was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved to a three-room service apartment in the newly constructed teacher's house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there was three classes and in Petershausen five in Kollbach im Schulverband Petershausen-Kollbach.
From the school year 1968/69, they were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the School Association Indersdorf was established, there was only primary primary school in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, then-rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsruhe - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain today's construction from September 1982, which was expanded to judge retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who built up a work room in addition to community expenses and in the expansion of 1997 basement rooms, even though that was not eligible under the school buildings guidelines.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Judge recalled.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had replied to a school counsellor on law and justice: "You must never forget the love," Manfred Richter never forgot what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: Roots and wings," says the now 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: "Didn't always succeed," whether he just means his students or just as much his own six children is not entirely clear.
In any case, judge's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When they were checked, they did not receive a criminal work and were not allowed to sit and sit.
At the expense of the community, judges were able to create two pairs of boxing gloves and let the two parties compete against each other, even if they were to have a meal.
For the good of the school judges considered a recorder a good relationship with the then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the non-partisan judge after retiring at least as the last on the CSB list for the local council in 1996.
But judges were elected six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicycle riders in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scots stopovers
If cyclists do in Bad Salzhausen or Scots Rast, this is not special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of people left behind: The 700 participants of the hr4-Radtrip and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Morning Alteburgpark.
Under the slogan "cycling and celebrating on newfound ways between Nidda and Kintens," participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday, it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, 60 kilometres above Florcity to Bad Salzhausen and continuing to Scots in attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were greeted by Mayor Hans-Peter Cervantes, who had taken a bike ride in Bad Vilbel and the manager of the Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: The rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 bleaches of apple, twentieth-century, cluster and cheese pie, which thoroughly silenced the skilful cyclists.
"These cakes can only bake rural women," praised one participant from Aulendiebach while orbiting another piece.
There were cold refreshments available at the drinks booth of the gym.
The "duo Bravo" underperformed the visitors with familiar melodies from operetta and musicals and greeted enthusiastic applause.
The location of the hotel was excellent. The staff were very helpful and friendly.
One gentleman also enjoyed a head massage of his partner: "He deserved, after all, he has already reconnected in today's dotted bike chains."
In the meantime, the mayor and the manager were still working: They were interviewed at the well in front of Reporters Rainer Janke's drinking house and took the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Since the first hr4-Radtour 2004 as a tour leader, promotion manager Tobias Hagen has been able to do just a short while, but he had plenty to do with the technique on the ground.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated through three phones and a radio device with his staff and the 15-member motorcycle squadron of police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and made reports that he needed a check.
"Most of the participants were from the Rhine-Main-area," he said, "but also from casting or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have travelled.
The number of participants depends a bit after the available overnight capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collection accommodation.
From the spa, the bikers had a good impression when they broke up after an hour and a half: "Chüss!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" beckons her to leave.
After arriving in Scots, the group allowed a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists were called in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a nice festive atmosphere and, of course, had prepared treats, such as flame cakes with a well-cooled spring white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS General Manager Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as Board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thuringia welcomed visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many running in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen then gave the dance stage free.
In spite of the sporting activity on the bike, the opportunity for the sungent Beast in the open air was fervently used by bicycle.
Among the guests, there are increasing numbers of people who have enjoyed the good mood as well as the large char of cyclists.
On the second day, for cyclists, the stations of Birstein, Guardiarksbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the programme.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycle boats, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for 'conspiracy' against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "plotting against the government," local media agencies report.
Police authorities did not release any immediate comment.
Among those detained are 14 senior police officers, reports arrest ripen Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal union and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla manslaughter against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents brought Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk his daughter to school.
There, he told journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in any school.
The sky is not peaceful across Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian front must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastuklet, school leader of the school in Slavjansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be restored here and that children will be given education that will be useful to them in further lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, ballots in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
It meets with a proud rest office from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And it has its own frontal experience.
Their career started at the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., where they moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearson's media world.
She was seven years CEO of the Financial Times and resigned when the top post of parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their severance bill was said to be almost £1 million.
Her political ranking is solid, too.
It was suggested to David Cameron of Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when that after more private-sector knowledge was sought in Whitehall: She became an adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband is an earlier Tory council member.
As early as May, I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned Kelch.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence works in two directions: To the inside of the first guard of their own managerial hierarchy in the BBC, but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and anxiety when things are going wrong.
This ensures an almost untenable Duopol, which requires full comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming chairman would be in danger of going up, going down on everything and creating an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he is perhaps doing his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that weren't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC fall down - power, money and status are out of date.
While the competition is closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the pending trial of royalties is associated with specific dangers for the BBC.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is investing in the world's most certainly largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: It says it reaches 96 per cent of all households and costs each of them just 40 pence a day.
And, apparently, the BBC rises back up on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get messages today on my mobile phone and watch programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and considerable institution.
She needs a strong chairman - I hope she found it.
Perry from Texas says that derogatory tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the Republican governor's office of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday included a derogatory comment on the Democratic district attorney's office, which is at the heart of a criminal indictment against him for abusing the official.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry's user account that cancelled the previous one.
A tweet was sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the tweet and have deleted it," it was in the later news.
Perry's employees did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Although the tweets from Perry's official user account were removed, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the earlier tweet, an unfavorable image of the district attorney's office was drawn by Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a financial support for her office when she refused to resign, leading to a charge against Perry -- who may be a 2016 presidential candidate -- ahead of a grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always go drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level but if I do, I dress Governor Perry if he picked it up."
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not charged with running over the grand jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charge a political ploy.
His highly-regarded team of legal counsel applied in the case of the judge to dismiss the indictment and argued that the law enacted against the longest-running governor in the history of the state of Texas is unencumbered by difficile.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of federal money to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and is based in cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to step down.
This veto ensured a public complaint from a leftist Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the polling stations in Iowa during his presidential run in 2012, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by taking a tweet of a photograph of herself while jogging near a lake post, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market back for 'normal'
One of the most prominent builders in London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England was back to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were hot and the subject of huge price increases, led by the Bank of England as a result of the widespread fear of a credit bubble to set limits on mortgage lending in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chief executive of the high-priced construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013," adding that this offers a "stable action environment."
The property market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed to the capital.
According to information from the Qatar Office, prices in the urban area have risen by 18.5% in the past year alone, much more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
Average selling prices at bruneys' private, inexpensive and student offerings rose by about a fifth in the past year and were down by the £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property property in London less attractive in recent months for foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new housing taxes and political rhetoric around a possible "Village tax" before the general elections next May.
The London-based real estate broker, Foxtons, warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which tougher lending arrangements were unveiled, would lead to less market growth in the second half of the year, both in real estate sales and prices.
New data from the Bank of England of Monday show a drop in mortgage approvals in July, which also indicates that the housing market is cooling off.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its prediction for the rise in house prices in London for 2015 after 3 per cent, on the basis of an already debilitating skin price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, is now down a quarter by year after year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Still, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a boon, as the amounts owed for futures are at more than $2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best sites remained stable and as a result the futures sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax profit rose 40 per cent to £280 million a year, with sales up 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a note on Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said revenue for Berkeley was likely to meet current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts fully appreciate the annual pre-tax profit to £450 million.
Volkswagen shares stood at $23.96 in the afternoon in London trading.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence released by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence perform at the 85th Oscar win.
Naked photos of the Oscar winner, Jennifer Lawrence, were released online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the stars from "The Tribute of panem" confirmed that the photos were of Lawrence's real and complained the hacker was "blatant violation of privacy."
Authorities have been notified and will track all those posting the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on the photo sharing site 4chan, were allegedly procured by a gap in the online storage system icloud by Apple, the alleged "master list" of hacking victims include the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Wlements and Mary-Kate Olsen, Buzzfeed reported.
It's not certain how many of the images are real, though Wlements, star out of "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter, also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos taken by my husband and myself years ago in the private environment of our house -- I hope you're so pleased with you," Mr. Wlements wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice of the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were images of her, and tweeteted "These so-called naked images of me are fake, people.
Let's defend the beginnings. * Worgame intends *.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of it.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J."
They were swept up, so it was best to describe it as a cardboard box that you were left in the rain.
Occasionally, he told a woman he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distanced, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shook him up the hand.
Scratchy, he knew.
He was storied, as in hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim of this loathing was a straight starting affair that was more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and may even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a treacherous beauty with uncapped hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which even was even more remote and rough as port Reuben.
She had come south with an elderly escort who held Kevern for her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a humid but paradise valley with the true named Paradise Valley.
Over several years, no one had lived in the house.
The tubes were leck, in the bathrooms were still spiders, neck necks had left their marks on all the windows and believed they belonged to them all, and the garden was stocked with weed that looked like giant cabs.
It was like the house from a children's tale, both menacing and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn hanging on the broken deck chairs in the tall grass and having enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, and both had clinched an unusually warm spring afternoon, putting the country with calming music and appeasing messages, as the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer, who his father liked to audition at closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - Nothing was so properly forbidden - simply didn't play.
It was successfully made obsolete, just as the word obsolete.
The general taste of what leaving and regulations had never been achieved, and, like, the people on books choose the vomer-et-propelled millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love novels, they chose ballads while playing music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and playing great feet in a grop-comical Serenade Ailoff.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he declared her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
This had always been done by his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had been told.
When you start a word with a J, without putting two fingers above your lips, it costs you a Penny.
It wasn't a very funny game at the time and it wasn't very funny right now.
He knew this was what was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of it.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly banned.
The improvising was no longer modern.
It was just space for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be completely safe at the start of a tune where it would end.
Equally, the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically minded.
Although he had been 10 years old without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the half-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singer wasn't black.
Again, no laws or constraints were needed.
A compliant society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of a group gifted - and as grateful as those prescribed by fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and body building for entertainment and sports, so sang and ran them.
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed as by nature with electronic talent and were supervised with the task of making sure that no family left without a functioning telephone line.
What was left of the Polish community cared for the sewers; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf states and the levee whose grandparents did not quickly exit the country as a WHAT WHY, WAR, WENN ES happened to WAR - fearing that the flames would consume them as the next, because of fear, even that the flames would open up to them - and Shisha pipes opened, and became depressed and became depressed with inaction.
Each one after his abilities.
Since they had only heard ballads, it struck Ailinn hard to understand how the offending words, which Kevern had her straight pre-sung, could ever be more expensive.
Music was an expression of love.
"Those aren't really insulting," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He retreated to much, but the neglected garden gave him the elusive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the huge amounts of carbon leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, however, hesitating to put two fingers on her lips in her present.
She already thought he was a little odd.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook unglamorous her head and blocked Kedwell's point of view.
There was nothing else going on around the world, as her uncanny rabid hair.
There was nothing he would want to see otherwise.
"If you say it," I do without conviction.
But that does not explain why you blame it.
She seemed honest.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet so directly not.
Maybe your ankles, a small bit of
And you say, you hates me because my ankles are too thick?
Do you hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
This is just the silly song.
He could have said "I love you" but for that it was too early.
"Your thick ankles are precisely the reason why you fool me," he tried instead.
I'm a little bit perverse.
That did not sound right.
It had to be weird.
When he tried to be comical, he often brought in trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to harass the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel, too.
Maybe he wanted to, Kevern, that.
Despite its friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from their decked, threw the console around and devoured the wine they had been drinking.
Holunderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In their excitement, they seemed trembling, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your colt's head is precisely why I felt perks to you," she said
Except that I'm not at all.
They were sorry, both because of the unnecessary uneasiness of his words, as well as the fear that showed in her eyes as she leaned against him.
Did they think he would beat her?
She had told him not from life on the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt it was essentially like here.
The same giant and icy ocean broke up here as it was on the shore.
The same bewildered men, with even more thick skin and twisting after DEM WHY, happened to WAR as it had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, pulled from pub to pub, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or interrogated them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn't catch up!
It first crackled - crackling was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a antidote to the no-nonsense love ballads from the console - it first cracked and then beat it.
According to Keden's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the crack itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through her body.
He rose out of the deckchair like an old man.
She also felt bleed, but the brunt of his grief surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They were hardly aware of it.
She looked at him as though he was removed - as if from a room on the upper floor her companion looked at her - a man, complaining by something he himself had summoned up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
It felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from it, bowed to his back, embarrassed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she seemed to know well when she could not remember a single time she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was back alone, Ailinn was glancing at her feet.
A number of years before the events that have just been reported, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for the public mood, in a brief speech on the continued violence at low and middle levels, were expected to be expected in precisely the parts of the country, where the money and energy that had been invested in eradicating this violence have been expected to be expected in precisely the parts of the country where they have been most likely to be expected to be reduced.
"It has already been done a lot, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a nation that has fought a thousand wars and has won most of it, especially in the country's remote corners and valleys, in which the sweet breath of human friendliness has historically been felt historically despite the high-rise kirt wars between hedges.
But some traits turn out to be unrotting.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion that it continues to evoke.
The people wept in the hearing of sentimental ballads, intoxicated by stories of over-wrenching difficulties and claiming to be firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but it does not just keep the former raw power of rural communities, as well as our urban fabric, but there is also evidence of the emergence of new and insidious disputes at home, in the workplace, on the streets, and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said, as he had read the entire report.
I suggest that you read less novels.
ESME Nussbaum cut her head.
I also have to ask: Are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that," ESME Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Again, ESME expressed its right to privacy and denial of testimony.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask this," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, reading, or feminism.
This is a prejudiced job here.
We serve a non-prejudiced society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in itself are perfectly acceptable and commendable, may occasionally distort results such as you have presented.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "insipid" and "raw," could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of naturally strength and vitality.
If you continue along the road, WHAT WHAT, WENN ES happened IST, as if it had happened yesterday, it would mean taking the country essential to life.
ESME Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED writer in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had granted to the country in the last quarter century or more.
Smile your neighbor, valuing your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, speak to you, explain, listen to, tune in, apologize.
Speaking better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you want," explained ESME Nussbaum, with a quiet voice, when she was sure that her forearm had spoken, "and I say nothing more than that we have not yet healed as effectively as we fool ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in the way in which we repeat the mistakes that have been made at all by the WHAT, WENN ES.
This time, however, it is not the others that let our anger and our mistrust fade away.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands.
To indicate an angel's wait.
"They go too far," he said, "when you describe actions as "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far if you talk about these "anger" and their "distrust" of "others."
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are speaking in terms of understanding the past, not of "us" and "others" when it comes to protecting the present.
There was no "us" and there were no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From that, if we are honest with ourselves," he ventured to accuse ESME, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I don't dress one.
Whether it was badly or well done what happened has happened.
That was then.
There is nothing to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no debt must be allocated, no blame must be paid if such repayment would be appropriate and if there is a way to pay them.
But what's serve the past if we don't learn from it -
The past is designed to let us forget it.
If I may say something about this -
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid fall together.
"I will consider her report," he said and sacked her.
The next day, when, as usual, she went to work, she was rushed by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had been driven in a manner of "brutal fury" on the foot.
Coincidences exist.
Lesothom military official says no coup plot is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official military officials in Lesotho were battling a coup to overthrow the government and said they were going against police accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and told police that the country's army surrounded his office and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The Premier brought his family to the adjacent South Africa after reports of assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup d'état, but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatic" whose arming was imminent by police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defence forces were from Lesotho, having received several intelligence reports that, within the police, some elements are operating, which in fact wanted to arm some of the political, bipartisan young fanatics who were on the verge of wrecking havoc," he said against Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said military action made the impression of a crash.
"Even though no one has claimed to have hijacked the government by force, all reports are agreed that the activities of the defence forces from Lesotho have shown signs of a coup," he said.
Spokesmen for the military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that soldiers were dragging back into their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, the Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing Takes the Governance during Thabane's absence.
Thabane announced that he believes he has become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been major tensions since June, after Thabane parliamentary sessions suspended because of clashes in his unity government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, in defiance of lurid accusations.
Manufacturing in the eurozone at a 13-month low
The rise in output in the eurozone slowed to its lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely watched study.
The company's final market purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, following a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication of more than 50 is an expansion.
New orders came back and factories experienced collapses at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come ahead of the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to take a clear plan for dealing with a reluctant eurozone recovery as well as the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that, in the course of this week, the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information on whether it is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those made by Britain and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increased economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's biggest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economic nation, France, the PMI dropped to 46.9.
France remains a sorority, as does Italy's descent from a robust expansion to stagnation.
Indications are that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, are no longer reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in the industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts expecting further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the Purchasing Managers' index in the eurozone from August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone obviously find life difficult at the moment, as current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially in respect of Russia and Ukraine - are adding to uncertainties in continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, consumer confidence, and probably means that some contracts are delayed or even cancelled, in particular large orders.
He said that "increasingly likely," the ECB would eventually have to launch some sort of QE "although we suspect this will be limited."
The hellish year for the victims of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children caught up in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militia groups in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the greats in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school of Beslan, in which 334 people were surrounded, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the start of a new school year, this seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the greats in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, though the memory of this terrorist hell is going to follow them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now afflicts Ukraine - and in the children as it is dying - is now coming to an end.
The girl, photographed in the attempt to climb back into the shattered school sports hall
It was photographed by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she tried only in her underwear to climb back into the shattered school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Totally confused, Aida searched for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought dead, but they survived.
"One woman told me to run around my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were bloodstained.
I stood up and climbed back to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a series of operations, she felt completely cured, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I fear that I will have to operate again.
Some pomegranates are still in my knee.
Their goal is now to become a dentist to help people understand how their care was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me down," she says of campaigning.
"That's what happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remind myself of those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
It says the siege is always going to remain a part of it, though the memory of each year becomes somewhat weak.
I am glad that a lot of people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I watch online the photo of me, as I sneeze back into school, I think a lot of people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help that something like this does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball hastened in opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said: "Mama told me I should lay down if there were an explosion, and hold their hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Run."
Full of fear that she could be dead, he fled and watched on the road a crying infant, grabbed it at the hand and fled by a ball chest.
His father, Vladimir, who closed his son outside the arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, 'I couldn't save her.'
In fact, Tamara was left outside and left with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn, in the assumption that their son had died.
After reuniting, she said: "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was flown to London later (of the now suspended newspaper News of the World) to get the title of a barnardo's children's champion from then-Premier Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop with remembrance," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it's going to be blurry in my memory.
I still know that I threw away all my toy guns directly afterwards.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid of going back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids with whom I played in the yard and who didn't get out of it.
We never say they were killed or are dead.
We say they have stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London, especially to the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me.
"I'm so sorry for any of those suffering from the greats," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer at a monastery last week.
I like to help.
I want to go to police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly recalls her journey to London with Damir.
People in London wept as I told our story.
At the time, I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her foundation thankful for the prize and the ability to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her just that 10 years has passed, but I still remember the meeting to me her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borshsch and call them all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he was playing with waders in a restaurant, Damir showered with his water gun on her and they ran away and played with him.
And this was just a month after horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share and support our pain.
She said: "I always think this world hasn't got better in those 10 years.
In Ukraine, war is now going on, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are precisely such children as ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news that they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir became tall and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he's not aggressive or angry at all.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not overwhelmed by the past greats.
I know he doesn't like to be reminded of it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and lit candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes put on the sofa, turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember, as he did, all his arms and other military toys, and Damir is now 17, bigger than I, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so certain for some hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I was recovering after the explosion and came to my feet, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with bodies lying around everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my little boy could survive in this hell.
"I remember seeing him running, "Damir, running, running away," but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so the life, unlike that of many others, continues for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image was revealed after the siege to symbolize the Greuel of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan-survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother, Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His blooded face was marred by fear as he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for Beslan's barbarity.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had removed him for his first day of school before being rushed to bring her older son, Vladimir, to the university.
"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy left there for three horrible days alone," she recalled.
Not very alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgiy managed to survive.
The closer to that date, the heavier it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day in which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time coming, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days watching me forever.
Nobody will ever forget that, I promise you.
Insistent: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalised as a statue (right)
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school on that day, and he said that he wanted to hug his teacher.
I just knew he was alive when I watched him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture and it is hidden from us at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that this kind of thing can never happen again.
"I doubt we ever learn the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused it?
This world becomes something of a terrible thing.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does happen?
Ten years is nothing in this kind of pain.
We need dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a couple nightmares because of the siege, but then it became better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and had been scared every day.
I thought to my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That is why I always go to the sports hall when 1 September is nearer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel as a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not going to forget, but I'm not painting me.
My life continues.
I completed the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I will become cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was training in the Army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health didn't allow that to happen.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived, despite being trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Faniyev was caught during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the gym and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go as an intelligence officer to the FSB, but did not do so because of his health damage because of the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I must say that's not true.
"I worked with psychologists in 2006 and I actually felt a bit better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - the year after that - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return to it and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous image.
Survivor: Georgij Faniev today, with a photograph of himself at the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendously and I carry him with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm good at it.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can do well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's intelligence academy in St Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have my documents, also the medical records and they have replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have two years behind me there.
It learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about this and they should not suffer it, of course.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
He is in my mind, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know that Georgij is not going to go along.
It must be much more intense for him because he was there and I don't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I am grateful to God for giving me back, and here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.
It is hard to accept that when something is so poor.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He has been operating several times, he can walk, but don't drive any sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror at 50%, but we can never overcome and forget that.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege and this merely reinforces my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and which were expensive to me.
My son is at me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is crying around those killed.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It is hard to accept that life is going on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can almost not believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we now fight?
People and children are suffering, and I am sure that many children have already been killed and many are killed in Ukraine.
If we could just grab and flip all of these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby who was so apprehended by a Special Operations Command in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She's now 10 (right) and doesn't remember the cruelties at all
The world held the breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but kept in their cruelty their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father, Ruslan, married again and, with his new wife, Swetlana, a little girl that he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now 10 years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids," says one close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that emerge with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most competitive option is a watertight Point And-Shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action Cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are both for about $300.
I took those photos at a family festival with multiple cameras, all of which are available at a cost of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery pack and other subjects are close.
Add your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders contain scene and recording modes, with which the exposure time is optimized for the insulating underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras are allowed just for up to 5 feet, others by 50 or 60 feet.
Search for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many aren't going to fold up.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action Cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to look at it underwater, and the right image setting is a good thing.
So make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a row mode with which a number of recordings are made with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the farther you remove from the surface.
So if possible, keep close to the surface if you make recordings in a pool, a lake or sea.
This way you can add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less colour you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is good advice to land as well, but it is all the more important because of the poor light conditions.
It is especially important if you work with an action Cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you have to approach your objects more tightly if they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As consultant anesthesia, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick from both the agony of the disease, as well as the anguish of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and disease, while the treats are predominantly engaged with something quite another: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble getting open.
While he struggled with the grippe-like symptoms, he noted that he made impatient allegations to his wife, Juliet.
"I want to do anything right now than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and without cause worried.
Anything was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray inspection of his breast.
Just two weeks ago, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray inspection was ahead.
He suffered mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects breast skin, that is, the lungs rash.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually hard to determine.
For example, while some smokers are diagnosed with lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers sooner.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos-strain - contact with the fibre that was once known as a "miracle ingredient" but has since been recognized as lethal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s, when industry volunteered to use it no longer.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries were working directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenter and shipyard workers.
As an industrial hazardous material from another time, it hardly seems worrying today.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the climax of a Mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths each year, twice as many people die of this disease as in road accidents.
Annual figures of the mesothelioma cases since 1980 and likely future deaths in UK
The reason we're seeing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999, all asbestos types were banned), is that a mesothelioma evolved only after decades.
And the scourge of the mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the building industry.
Asbestos has been, and is often still available in the homes where we live, the offices in which we operate, the schools where we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And so Mesothelioma does not know any class barriers, financial limits, professions, or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
The parliament buildings are asbestos-tainted.
Even in the hospitals in which we are to be healthy, we have already been identified as the starting point for this deadly carcinogens.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber, either.
In fact, it was hard to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like being in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I've been training for six years was a lot of asbestos," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and Pförtner - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer that question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital, and who were diagnosed with mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I'm the last one that still lives."
How many of us will become ill?
At Andrew Lawson, mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma diseases die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always kills.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still going to become ill?"
The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, accepts that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to grind to a halt, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be lost to the victim.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like that.

A quick look at the files of the courts, which the people concerned frequently turn to for compensation for damages, shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioma is already common.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted Janice Allen had been exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years as when she started work at M & S.
She now has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesothelioma, I didn't know anything about asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
There are few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not relate to a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "assailable," a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction business.
Chrysotil, also known as a white asbestos, is now by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boilerinsulating, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is nonetheless viewed by the EU and the WHO as "major health risk" with possible death row.
However, dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear, but indirect, evidence that this was a key reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was placed in the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, asbestos exposed to Alamy
Janice Allen may not have been seen as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
It has presented a study of those affected, in which it is depicted that "an essential part of the mesothelioma without a known suspension was caused by work or in the home probably caused by asbestos-related contact in the environment."
Much of this contact is based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks as if no one could be expected to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined Westminster's palace, shows how people may also have been exposed to the substance in the heart of government, unwittingly.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service members and pipelines behind the committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres were mutated by something as harmless as "heavy air movements."
MPs are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the management of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the West Minster Palace had received a "clean health certificate," it is now undisputed that EUR 1 billion has to be raised over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election Members are likely to meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than the Green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
Everything that can be done now is waiting.
A person who has never been able to determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places where you worked, and to the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, in which he got such a fever.
He was 45, and held surgery just late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I believed the trip home was no longer to be created.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain stemmed from breast skin, skin around his lungs.
But, as Janice Allen did, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work a month.
At the end of his life, she studied medicine at the time.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health was slow and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient Abbott came with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott doesn't do this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The compound in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition again deteriorated and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a probe fitted with a camera has been inserted into the cave between the ripped and breast hair.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
Honestly, I hadn't been worried at all about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was concerned.
The result of the biopsy lay in the week between Christmas and New Year before: "One told me that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had dates with Macmillan-nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
It is only now that he is referring to the scale of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where tubes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now contracting.
And so Mesothelioma now hits younger people who haven't worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with assailants in hospitals were below the ground, so patients were probably more likely to be exposed to the substance.
But many staff involved in pedestrian tunnels from one building into another (as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely to be in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that several decades after the war, hospitals for patients may have been life-saving, but life-threatening for the attending doctors.
It is still removed today.
Students turned their Bunsenburner onto asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Because of its fabulous isolation and flame retardant properties, asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and townspeople.
Schools too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos-related contact in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemicals, students have turned their Bunsenburner on asbestos-related mats.
On websites, the issue of asbestos is now frequently addressed in schools.
And at the same time, as innocent objects in our homes, such as floor plates or scraping rooms, contain asbestos by default.
"It is an industry advocate that is included in much of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial at Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact one of a concerned woman fell, the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So adjust how you tear down your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas fest.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from a doctor's position on that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he recalls how overwhelmed he was from all the information he was coping with.
"It was very hard to record it all," he says.
"I asked my doctor "how long do I have?"
And one gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking I thought, "Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas.
It was then."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos-related contact.
Asbestos is made up of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is softened and the fibres are inhaled, they can be fixed in the breast skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate breast skin and may trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled nadel-shaped asbestos-based fibers," Professor Tom Treasure, a heart Thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital, from which Andrew Lawson suspects it has exposed it to asbestos, is now, ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasurer knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital.
Once the asbests reach lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature, it is invasive from the outset.
The usual options for other cancers don't work as well at mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial, for example.
Some say they are worth a try.
Treasurer denied this.
"You can't cut the breast skin," he says.
They don't come up with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "on chemotherapy does not very well address" the "effect shows," but not heals.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After being contacted by Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and advisory office for co-workers.
"Hello, cancer central," he turned cheerfully at calls.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years before and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott was offered six chemotherapy cycles that last four months and his life is expected to extend just a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "put things in a rather more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, Heart Thoraxspecialist at the Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to be referred, I just called and got a date," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and have to wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is vital for mesothelioma sufferers to perceive the best available therapies.
But if those treatments finally fail, many concerned are from another financial concern - about the future of the families that leave them.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that even a very small burden was a health risk.
And here, the company's negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally put their case to their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "full-back compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute security that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos-related contact at the Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a spokesman for the Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected basement area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is for mesothelioma sufferers who are seeking compensation, an enormous problem to represent the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their previous employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance records may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that time is right for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there have been clear new legislation this year making it easier for Mesothelioma stakeholders to redress compensation, even if their former employers are no longer involved.
The law has set up a taxpayer-funded fund of £350 million for all those diagnosed after July 2012, but can prove a contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 per cent of what a court could have been able to speak in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications are expected in the program each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma parties, thinks that £350 million was a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal from insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time hadn't gone and mesothelioma sufferers could find the businesses and sue them normally.
Also, Mike Penning, damth-working and pensions minister, admitted that the law was "not perfect."
But both pennies and Morgan said that in the face of seven fatalities daily, swift action is needed.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Mr. Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December of last year.
At this time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive impact in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - triple therapy, with Lang-Lazdunski showing a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This, of course, is with the most important thing," Mr Abbott says.
This is always seen in patients.
There is something you can carry on with you.
If you give up, it gets worse for you very quickly.
Graham Abbott underperformed the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Afterward scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then in March 2014, I had a scan.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I became just 50th.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-changing.
Again, Abbott pulled six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is more visible.
But the process is physically and mentally exhausting.
You have to think of practical things - about the money if I'm not anymore, for example, or showing my wife how the boilerage attitude works.
If you get bad news, you're going to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, is not always easy.
"For parents, this is hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had an illness with which I wouldn't get old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and unstressed.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reticent.
She didn't say much.
Such talks are something that must permeate all cancer patients.
But for mesothelioma, such conversations are not criss-crossed by hope, not a trail of hope for survival.
The disease brings a grim security (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould).
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong's right to government elections, protesters swear in retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament voted against candidates for the 2017 election by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach probably fueled the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists began planning and mobilizing in a few hours after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress makes it possible for communist leaders to dismiss all non-minded candidates.
"This does not happen unexpectedly, but it does make us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing had promised.
People have lied to Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of China's decision, Li Fei, vice-chancellor of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has pledged to allow residents to vote in government in 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct electoral vote, but the decision also makes it clear that China's leaders keep a close eye on the execution process by a closely watched by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates should be allowed "with love of land and love to Hong Kong."
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong's largest and most popular protests have been taking place in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the Movement is Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to shield the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain ahead of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, organizers shared that the movement "took into account the occupation of the central district just as a last resort, an action that is only supposed to take place when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and that the central district's occupation will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement and there were tighter security measures, including police forces and barricades, on Sunday before the government building.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their town.
The influx of people from the mainland reinforces competition for products and services.
It is also growing fears that the values of Hong Kong's values such as democracy and free speech are beginning to crumble amid mounting pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement as it hurts business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
"The protests they're talking about could cause great economic harm, depending on how many are involved and how long they continue," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to stir up fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral rights involving 78,000 people - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school leavers in the U.S. is now transferred to universities, where freshmen are offered appearances with the private plane.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the UK's first luxury travel service for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also admitted that the service had a safety net.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to take their belongings into a high-risk car by land.
Along with our new VIF options, we look forward to making sure this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that no new bookings had yet to be made as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the coming weeks."
The company also announced that despite tuition fees of £9,000 a year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today differ in their expectations and expectations very much of the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF it can be precisely that.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as having stepped down.
Megan Dunn, vice-president of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month are facing a crisis of living costs, as the available financial support in the form of loans and grants does not keep pace with the sharply rising bills for the simplest of life terms, before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as much as the arrival of the student residence.
Feminists criticize racial and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
Participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands high, don't shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo., due to the firing of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators attribute gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
While tensions in the Midwest rallied and given attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned 100% around the race.
Compared with the answers of black women just after the shots of August 9, the personal essays came with titles such as "thoughts on Ferguson from a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the suppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think you can find many people in feminism who are above the white and speak privileges at such a high class," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they must express that.
For English professor Coritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson's problems come to light, to which black American women are exposed each day, but who are not considered "women's members" in the cultural space.
"I can release something funny on Facebook about me and my partners and get 150 Likes from all over," Mitchell said.
When I poked something about how farmyards are under siege in their own country, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who has studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the topics clean; they live in combined reality every day.
While white women now combine the themes of race and gender in the feminist mainstream, says Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender research at George Mason University that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were yellowed and the rationale was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynch killing.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women at the point where white fighters were analyzed in the late 19th century for women's suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony, was that the fight for the right to vote could have been successful only for each group: Women or blacks.
"They met the decision to apply for the women's rights issue, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
If you are reminded of such things, you will be aware of a power why coloured women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson -- police behavior, racial discrimination -- a mirror of the times when white feminists played "fliers" with the problems with which black women have stood apart for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who set up their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem walked two weeks after the firing of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointy article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she calls for more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding one of the body's inherent danger - and opinions about race that are significantly different in public surveys - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Though Steinem faces a more intersectional feminism in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some are perplexed by their comments on the racial issue in America.
Christina Sommer, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole Feminism?" said to She The People, that young men in the United States, particularly young coloured men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters" but Steinem's remarks to Ferguson stand in contrast to their earlier criticisms.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently laid out a small program, My Brother's Keeper, set up to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between police forces to the black community is not the only problem that is pressing into the forefront of mainstream feminist.
After the U.S. border police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also resurfacing the surface - this time as a women's detachment.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the topic as an essential women's attention, it only needs to publish them the stories of immigrant women.
"These are speaking for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find an aftershock in women's organisations," she said.
'pig house' in Ipswich faces sale
The image of a house being sold was removed by real estate brokers when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had been comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, situated on a private street in Ipswich and will be offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which included a pig, that his head had poured onto a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"The photograph was taken out by mistake, however, and has since been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the previous collection hall as a "unique single-family home with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The home sales were in the social media for interest, as some questioned whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SWcity Harvey home after lottery win a new millionaire
A lottery player from Harvey is due this month
The search for a new millionaire in the Southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot for the second time in five years, following $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, has yet to report.
The shopkeeper Steve Forward said the profit makes concern for talk in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought such a benefit could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated gains in the first division last month, a due deal for a couple of happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale was one of five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had made the mega-profit of $7.5 million just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said the profit allows them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the First Division in WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the gladiator arena
Not only were the gladiators standing knee-deep in the Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Römerday in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract much more than 1000 visitors yesterday, defying the showers of rain and the cold cold and reeling from the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful tract of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the Romans and their importance to the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martian fighters group from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis," who used each rain break to demonstrate their robust combat skills in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" turned out to be a humorous and knowledgeable presentation and sent his men into the ring for the heroic toss in various gladiatorial battles.
At first, the "provocators" were on the left leg and legs on the left leg and arms along the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short shambles and nails as well as iron gladiator helmet, bass and armour.
Especially impressive was the appearance of "Retiro," who joined the "Secutor" with litter network, Dreizack and Dolch and recently joined the burgers to the floor.
Since the heavy metal is metallic, the shields spilt and the joints were swept through the arena that could become a fear and bange about the health of the gladiators.
But at the time the imposing "Summa Rudis," the muscular referee, always looked attentive.
"We wanted to rekindle the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman time experience," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the "Friends of Roman Canal," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation time, the theme park for a day was an "Oppidum Romanum," a Roman city, as vice-chancellor, Claus Wehage, in his greeting word.
After all, the Romans did not only bring about war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire.
Remains of these were also visible from the Roman day, such as "Aqueduct marble" of the eleven metre high and 1400 m long Roman canal bridge that stood at ventilation.
The frontinus society once confronted the water and energy supply and now opposite, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still taking advantage of the knowledge from then."
It was also confirmed by graduate surveyor Ralph Heiliger of the "Engineering Team Two" from Rheinbach, the surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 and brick from the original hypocrites, the hot air heating that once engulfed the Roman villa.
The footprints that were left behind by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago were also impressive before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Ground Floor Management at the National Association of Rhineland dug up the remains of a Roman villa at the Nord in Rheinbach commercial park.
We have found outline walls of an economic building with a darling for the drying of cereals and mobs.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural commodity, explained the archaeologist Dr Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations put them in a glass salon, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the 4th century BC, until the fall of Germania in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser is suspected.
The children were also involved in the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or, as once the Roman students, they wrote their names with metal objects on paper boards.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children had to lay out mosaics and, at the stand of the Rheinbach glass mosaic, tinkering and at the stand of the Nature Centre Eifel Nettersheim, a heavy wheat mill made up of stone used to grind the flour for a flurry bread or a muesli.
The Roman travel car, which was made by two cold blossoms, drove visitors through the theme park and also at the impressive state of high school in the middle of the gymnasiums that presented the results of its "Römer-projectees."
With a Roman week from 13th to 21st September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be a part of the Rhineland region, which will commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with its historical and historical centres, as well as the Wachtberg Hiking Association, the Association of Association and the Pedagogist Oberbachem, there are also thematic hikes, a lecture, a lecture, and guided tours for school classes and remind of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire from his work on the subject of Wachtberg, presenting plants as a living monument of thought from the Roman era, and a witty lesson in the understanding of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germania" and associated Romans.
In the context of a project week, Adendorfer Elementary School dedicates itself to the Roman theme.
With the Roman week the numerous and frequently seen traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be rediscovered.
At the Wachtberg City Hall, a small presentation will be made to the fund of the Berkumer Matronenheiligation in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic saddles West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international businesses are going at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic dealt a severe blow to West Africa's economy.
The harvest rotates in the fields, the mines are abandoned and markets orphaned - the virus has made the region difficult to adjust.
Even some international companies are already walking distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also economic," ruled the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia hardest hit
"It's a complete disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second-largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia's clothing store.
The market is just about who wants to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia is hit hardest by the virus, alone here, more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, health officials declared that the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people were killed, and thousands more were trapped.
Foreign firms pull staff
In the resource-rich countries, firms run out of business.
Foreign companies like the steel company Arcelor Mittal are pulling off their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also responding: Few merchants are still leaving their home towns to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans are in the fields for export, for example.
Farmers don't dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
"People are getting less and less travelling," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris' expert on West Africa's economy.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells vegetables, remains at home.
This is why people are getting the effects of the epidemic directly and pressing: Food is scarce.
In the markets, stocks of basic foodstuffs such as rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the region's heavily dependent region threatens an image of the image - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies tend to avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
What is important is how far and how long the virus will spread.
For investors, the impression may be that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and thus to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also saddles the strained state budgets of states
The disease also saddles the already strained state budgets of the states concerned.
Ratings agency Moody's fears its budgets will be heavily strained by high spending on the health care system and in addition to the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also felt in Nigeria, where so far a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region is not affected in the southern Niger Delta.
But elsewhere, many people remain afraid of contagion at home.
Reservations also go back to hotels significantly.
Protecting celebrate their 50th anniversary
From 12th to 14th September, the "Tannenwald" Berngau Festival celebrates its 50th anniversary.
On full tours at the Tannenwald trench, preparations for the 50-year foundation from 12 to 14 September are under way.
Scheduled Friday, September 12, a major entertainment evening with the group's "Dorfrocker."
On Saturday at 6 p.m. the great villain shoot.
After that, in the grand marquee the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitbuth."
Brass band makes music play for the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festival service and at 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the grand procession at 2pm.
In the afternoon also the price distribution of the federal and Gauges.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 landlords with their dirndln.
The festival chapel is the brass band Berngau.
The patronage has been taken by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on the 21st March of the Association for "social entertainment using exercise in room service and small car sales."
The Nazi regime had led the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men who were born on 30 April at the Antonio's Lukas have taken the "new" trenchant "Tannenwald" Berngau.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a guard master through a difficult early season, in which it was primarily about finding a local club and installing the gunfire.
In the autumn of 1965, the "Leininger" at the "Leininger" inn opened with two teams in the lap races.
In the following years, the sportswear, which was organised in seven teams, was established in all classes up to the 1st Gauleague.
For the first time in 1980, Rudi Meier was succeeded by Rudi Meier, the club records purtent and the magic limit of 380 rings.
As the performance of the active shooter has increased, membership numbers have also developed positively.
After the "Leininger" club was no longer enough to meet the demands of a modern Schützenverein, then, under the leadership of Johann Rinn, the Board of Directors decided to create a future domicile in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis."
After a work carried out by 2700 hours on May 8, 1988, priest Strasser declared the Church's blessing for the new trenches.
One of the big highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44th Gaushoot, combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On the 23rd and 24th of April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a Böll group was founded.
Josef Schmalzl became a member of Böll.
A big challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böll meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, in the past year the club members have modernised the rooms and the firing facility at the Berngauer Hof.
Eleven teams in lap races
It is also possible to watch the sporting performances of the Schützenverein.
In total, eleven teams are currently competing in the lap races: Six aircraft teams, an aircraft gun team, a CC1 sports gun, a youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi degrees and Kerstin Kellermann have risen from the Gauleague League (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) in the league table in 2013/14.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml joined the Gauleague League.
In addition to the shooting, events such as Bockstand, Carnival and the Royal ball, the club and the Christmas party tradition.
In addition, the shooters are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers accident in return to the circuit
Tony Stewart's return to the circuit ended roughly halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car to the garage and left it without speaking to journalists.
His team principal, Chad Johnston, said his 14-game team is disappointed but will now concentrate on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had better use and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We head to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove past the race Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I got into a good result today with quite good hopes," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewarts" car was loaded into the sluts and the team had packed and was ready to depart.
Stewart allowed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtag race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and either win in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in pursuit.
He returned to work in the workplace while an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. was investigated and this one took to the runway during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities announced Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made about whether Stewart must face any charge.
The three-time champion was greeted with a great deal of applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start to 12th position, Stewart was already in the first 10 shortly thereafter and was temporarily ranked No.
After a restart in round 122, Bushs broke
Car with No. 18 out of control after exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell to No 21.
Dance joyous offspring sought
Just try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Neitzel (from left) look forward to fellowships.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups can be created in the TV Jahn of full-day classes at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have been heavily decimated.
Now it's going to be stronger offspring being searched for a sport that's healthy and great fun.
In both the jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits," are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eighth to 12-year-olds, six in the group of Twelve to 15-year-olds," the 20-year-old tells me.
With more takers, the whole thing would be far more fun, "you could dance very different choreographs," she says.
If you are interested in dancing, Thursdays between 17: 00 and 18: 00 or Fridays are between 17 and 6.30 p.m. in the dance room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without notice in the training session.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," the trainer tells me.
After that, different choreographies are inserted.
Jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore about classical music to sports and acrobatics are processed in the jazz dance.
Of course, the conviviality does not come too soon.
"We're also going to eat, watch dance movies and we've stayed in the dance room too," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
For whom jazz dance is not so, it can be sniffed in one of the TV Jahn's other offers.
Children and young people can take lessons in lessons in the classes of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini-Ballett, video lip-dancing and hip-hop in classes.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings Monday and Wednesday.
If you are interested in Discofox, Langseed Walzer, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you may want to watch and participate.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest before the Judiciary in the capital, Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration they repeated their demands to restore their old working conditions, which were changed recently.
Higher salaries are also on a debt list to be discussed with the interim justice minister, Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
In spite of the meeting between the members of the prison staff and representatives of the Directorate of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continued, the Director-General for the implementation of punitive measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov the BNR.
The protest of the prison workers is expected to be supported by members of the Association of Interior Department employees.
Ukrainian army abandoned airport by Luhansk
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters continue on the march.
After heavy fighting, in which it was said that Russian tanks were also involved, the Ukrainian army surrendered today, Monday, to the rebel stronghold of Luhansk.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had already drawn human rights from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have again shot down a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
About 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in the Donetsk region, according to the insurgents, according to Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard vessels sinking
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats from the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Awake Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of its ships had come under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the station 112.ua..
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported having brought several localities in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Belarus Contact Group meets today in Belarus's capital, Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In the run-up, all players took advantage of their appearances in the public announcement of their request.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO is not going to break its agreement with Russia as a result of the planned stationing in eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday that NATO considers itself the founding agreement of the UN NATO-Russia Council in 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a stark bruise" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," said Rasmussen.
From documents and opinions from the Russian side, it emerges that they regard us as an adversary."
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced plans to strengthen the NATO presence in eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" at NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East, as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have reportedly agreed to new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still awaiting a decision from the European Union whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger conveyed between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supplies for Europe.
Europe is about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel talks powerhouse: Toll will be "very clear"
Now the Chancellor is once again making a clear commitment to this.
However, a carte blanche for all the complicated details is not.
The CSU was visibly ripped off by persistent concerns from the CDU against passenger car tolls.
Chancellor Angela Merkel, after continued opposition from her CDU, spoke to a power source for introducing a passenger car toll.
"To be very clear about it, it's in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party leader said Monday after meetings of the CDU leaders in Berlin.
But, for the time being, Merkel did not notice a detailed model.
In the black-and-red government program, "certain parameters" are called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) "made a suggestion, and at that, further work is now going on."
The NRW CDU, however, is insisting on its No on a toll on all roads.
Merkel emphasized that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also constructively engaged in the deliberations for a bill.
In addition to the subject, he has also spoken with Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as broadband.
"There's nothing special about it," Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house reviewing its own approach to paying highway investors with toll revenue - after the 2017 election.
In the cabinet, Horst Seehofer warned that in the cabinet, toll concepts should be developed against the leading minister.
CDC official Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never went out to manned all the chalk and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU president.
In this respect it is an important signal that Seehofer has announced now to speak again on the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
In the background, there are concerns that a toll affects small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had asked for tolls from rows from the CDU coalition.
The left sees plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The bomb toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the New Bayreuth newspaper (Monday).
"With the toll, the minister fails," Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette duty on all German roads scheduled to start in 2016.
Domestic car owners may not be charged, however, under the Coalition Agreement.
Therefore, they should be given full compensation for the toll on the motor vehicle tax.
The model must not disadvantage foreign drivers under EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A Britin says she thought of as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnoses are a frequent problem in humans with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain are probably suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe gear and curved toes.
The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms are worse.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from cemetery Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she'd 18, and before her 30th birthday dying.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell all the time and everything took me longer.
I've never been able to drive shoes or skateboard with the other children and have often been to walk and walk in school because of my kind.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, she looked after several operations to discharge her Achilles and stretching her feet her medical records, when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received reply, I was shocked and badly panicked.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and in between is slowly losing all of my skills.
I did it all alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she was 17, her clear that her skills had not decreased as much as she imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up, and embraced me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you're in a wheelchair right now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic testing was established at her CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK launched a CMT Aware month to draw attention to this disease.
Rod's field Web site, D. Berni Diether, has been working since the closure of the former troop presence as a fire worker
Since less than ten years there has been no shot at the former troop level in Münsingen.
In spite of this, there are still ammunition at the heart of the Swabian region of Swabian Alb every month.
The grenades are sometimes even so dangerous that they must be splashed on the ground.
A deafening bang reverberates during the explosions across the heart of the biosphere reserve.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot at the estuary in Münsingen, closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since this time, the 6500-hectare area is the centerpiece of the Swabian Biosphere Region, which is open to 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington area rises with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rates for businesses in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly released study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia shared $27.6 billion in state and local jobs in the 2013 financial year, a 3.8 percent increase over 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The company's state and local taxes rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent the previous year, and it was the third year of growth after the several years of declining resolutions in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more sharply than local levies, down 4.3 percent, according to the study, conducted by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Tax, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Marylands' revenue comes from companies.
Virginia scores the slightest tax revenue with 28 percent.
Much of the rise in tax revenues is based in a recovery in corporate property values, the researchers say, leading to an increase in real-estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of those gains came from large states, such as California, New York and Texas, the deal also seems to meet Washington.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid over $10 billion in state and local real-estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 -- a 4.2 percent increase over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in property values in Maryland is not as effective in increasing government and local tax revenues as real-estate taxes amount to just over a fifth of the tax credits of businesses.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, this is happening: Much of the real estate, particularly in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that don't pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone.
Business revenues also appear to recover, according to data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden for businesses is not rising evenly across all three places.
The exit rate in the District was up 4.3 per cent to the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, up 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an underlying tax rise of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6 percent in all three quarters, has the distinctly lowest corporate tax rates (in all three there are firm corporate tax rates).
The company's tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the District at relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the start of this year showed that in Virginia lower state and local corporate taxes are required and a better tax climate overall than in Maryland.
The study was not investigated in the study.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the set will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to reach its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate by up to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be getting better, and they are therefore paying more state and local taxes, according to the most recent study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transition structure that most small businesses are organizing - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a sharp faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in general multi-agency tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Still, the area could lag behind Washington if the federal government's spending cuts affect the job market in the region.
Twin town: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's twin town in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight direct link between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's twin town Guangzhou - is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle in our town," the vice party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, said during this week's visit to a Socialist delegation in his city.
Time and again, China's ruling Communist Party came back to this concern of the twelve-million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, waiting Li.
As a result, people were also considering purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hess-based SPD chairman, Thorsten Schäfer Gümbel, who led the German policy delegation, told the host that he would be reeling in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
"For beer, it doesn't take much: Good water, grain and zest," he added at lunch with the party upper in Guangzhou.
This joie de vivre was already radiating Mr Li, flattering him to the host.
As a result, the official from Guangzhou, with shepherd Gümbel, met - but with red wine served to eat.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewery.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to German purity requirements.
More commerce
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said vice leader Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but scrapped in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"The business relationship between our two cities continues to grow."
At present, travellers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, clinging Li.
The administration of the Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight attendant.
The province's vice governor, Chen Yunxian, expressed this desire at his meeting with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied skulle Gümbel - Chinese vice-chancellor Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nicknamed approvingly.
Neat partnership
Guangzhou's leuttering vice leader hopes to be able to visit Frankfurt at a partner meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in that function.
He entered office only this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office on corruption charges.
The local party leader, Wan Qinglian, also had to go.
The action against officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration backed by force by leader Xi Jinping.
The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a leading official in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW was building a large plant.
Frankfurt officially received more than a dozen townspeople.
The call to Guangzhou's 9000 kilometres is one of those who are being cared for by both sides, such as a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis at the Pearl River is almost as strong as it is in Hessen.
The next year it wants to reach a gross domestic product of €250 billion, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers 'Hits the thumbs'
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her delivery to a hospital in New York City three days ago; however, her daughter was hopeful today that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her disease.
"Thanks for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a note today.
We're pushing all the thumbs up.
Her mother was reportedly admitted to Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday after an emergency because of cardiac arrest in a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors deliberately seduce them and under more precise observation until they are happier with their condition, which continues to be described as "serious."
The reactions came from many quarters, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that are now in trade, stricter environmental standards will apply in the future.
Like fridges and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners receive a label from September 1, on which the buyer can detect central data such as the power's energy efficiency.
For new cars in the category "Euro 6" stricter nitrogen oxide values apply.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolders: Getting a nationwide uniform minimum wage of EUR 10.25.
Amazon buys twitch for $1.04 billion
Amazon recently confirmed what information was reported Monday morning: The online retailer -- and video production maker, and a variety of other things -- buying the video streamingservice twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected a takeover of twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked as though the sale of twitch to the video service of Google for a cool billion decided thing, and cooperation appeared, of course, too.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their brave pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," according to an insider.
The Twitter interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which better-known (mostly older) games give a painting of Secret Science Theatre are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy twitch was somewhat bored, a textbook example of an established techno that buys a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal did not materialize with YouTube, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet shear, president of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of twitch.
For snobs like me, explaining that they prefer to drive sports than watching, it's hard to grasp the attraction that comes from watching others while playing the control console.
It's one thing to watch a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning on the back, while by Resident Evil, and something completely different from watching a spinner, as he shot 20 times in the head of Call of Duty 20 times.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are now egos games, so the addition without your own control of the eye can be a good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick-runs, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age are complete in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as it's not a play or humor virtuoso, its Twitter channel is probably not so very interesting.
But what do skeptics know, as I do?
Twitch is called by 55 million visitors each month and is the fourth-largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of this?
It's hard to imagine that twitch will be integrated so elegantly in Amazon's instant video, as YouTube twitch could simply have been swallow.
But twitch has something that any company likes to have: Thousands of young men who are being chanted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, shear, said Amazon and Twitch "believe both of the future of gaming," and the medium does not show signs of contraction, nor even - sip - as a spectator sport.
On the edge of the castle there was a lot left at the castle castle.
The concept of the organisers voted.
Despite the heavy rainfall on Saturday night, there were an estimated 1200 music fans at the open-air test in the Burggarten.
At times, admission had to be stopped.
"It was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
In two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
The open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to illuminate brightness on the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was already evident early on Saturday when the first visitors turned to the open air.
A celebration for all generations had promised organizers.
And they succeeded.
Around the power stalls at the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and other surrounding areas were cosy.
They watched the first live performances, wipes with the foot in the stroke, enjoying cool drinks - in short: Pure relaxation and enjoyment were needed.
And this right across generations.
While the one on ceilings on the specially designed white sand at the beach bar was on the beach bar, while others were lined up at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the offspring raced at the Hüpfburg, which was a major attraction for the smaller guests.
But also at the children's lips, the volunteers were in the truest sense of the word full of doing all the hands of the crowd and condoning imaginative creations into the small faces.
The bigger ones took advantage of Kickertables or a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot-crew set out from Salzwedel.
By the big rain came.
Just before 5.30 p.m., he prasked at the visitors, especially families seeking the vastness and Dry.
But the attraction of the festival did not stop it.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."
That is why a repeat of the big party will be nothing against the coming year.
Despite the need to work on the contents and size of the event, Sem made a first assessment of the popular vote on Sunday.
As annoying, he said that in the meantime, admission had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little effort.
As a result, some who had already paid didn't come back to the site.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer of about 1,200 visitors who tumbled in the Burggarten park.
There were problems with the sound technology.
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band blocks 'n' Rox broke their appearance for that reason.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably sound sound.
The planned Shishag lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tire pan.
"Next year, they will be," according to organisers.
The premiere of the Amula Open-Airs was more than succeeded by the visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made a number of mistakes which will be postponed for the first time, but in the second edition will have to be removed.
In the social network Facebook, too, the organisers must be critical.
"sorry, but for 12 euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier stated at the event site.
"You guys have accepted you a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same point.
Others do not see the initial problems as closely.
I find it very good that some people are not just stupid, but we are actually trying to do something about their legs.
Hats off!" writes Stephanie Jenß to the amula.
It is now a year for the organisers to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Instead, it is waiting for the part to be inserted into the distinctive edifice.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Nearly 50 years after building the space observatory's Tira, the shell, called radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller than the old with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
Size, though, remains world record.
The final step to complete the new shell is the Kappentausch
The upper part of the old shell is cut off and taken away with a crane.
After that, the final quarter of the new shell will be set up.
If the weather is involved, the action is scheduled to take place at the start of this week.
Contestants on the Ice-Bucket Challenge bounced in jaws
Isabelle Roberts from Britain shouted so much as her icy water poured over her head that she hurt her face's bone structure.
This Ice-Bucket challenge went painfully beyond that.
A woman was rushed to the hospital after she was so much screaming at the Ice-Buckett Challenge that she was skipping the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain circled so much as her icy water poured over her head that hurt her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I was doing the deed, my jaw was just standing," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is being buried over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't go, the jaw was haunting, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mother and my sister also looked at that and made up before laughing almost in the pants, but I had to get in the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Britain has been admitted to the hospital to return to the jaw after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Do the Burgundy clubs join forces soon?
Last but not least, there has been a B.A. between the two Wolfratshauser Burgundy.
Now, the boards are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burglovers, led the project in French Guédelon.
Even less than a year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Wolfratshausen.
There has been a lot of different views as to how the history of the Wolfratsher castle and possible reconstruction are to be dealt with.
The two camps are now moving towards each other: Discussions are to be held soon on joint action.
The club members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgundy) confirm on demand of our newspaper.
"I rang Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of both clubs could pull together again in future.
There are more rapid visible successes.
While the castle fans were aware of the sudden death of Richard Dimbath until the end of a reconstruction of the castle at Bergwald, the Burgverein around Sjöberg is in the vanguard of the "development and adventure" of the area.
Herbert Piffl, leader of the Burglovers, was very pleased with the call.
Since Dimo's death, he has been in front of the castle.
A new chairman is scheduled to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
At present, the club counts about 40 members, according to the 74-year-old.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we were left to rest the club's activities out of respect," this "think phase" was needed to "consider how things could continue."
According to Piffl, the new chairman then goes into the conversation with the Burgverein.
By then, the Burgundy fans could also make a topical sentiment within their grouping.
There are no candidates for the presidency at the moment, Piffl says.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself," he himself does not want to stand because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to continue with the project "but very happy to continue working."
The different viewpoints in terms of reconstruction will remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He credits Dimbath as "missionary" who has always believed in rebuilding the castle.
Two similar, even advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Due to the high level of participation of the population and volunteers from all over the world, they are a magnet for tourists.
Piffl: "Even I was skeptical at the start.
But in time, I became more and more convinced that it would be useful to advance the project." It could be a "one-size-fits-all" for the city.
There is nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of rebuilding, personally, I don't want to just take over board," he hopes that the castle club may be moving at this point.
Their goal, to document history first, "is important and good."
After that, you could see.
Clever ways to save at university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks is more than $1,000 per year for many students, the fast two-day graduate student, Matt Schroeder, turned out to be a clever savings idea.
He invented a surrogate system for books by students of higher semesters and offered nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Kek," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He gave up $120.
The Collect Association announced that students, on average, spend more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study material, but that there would be different cost fighting options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Hiring textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that hiring text books doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented at college bookstores last spring, said neebos vice-president Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are bought by the National Association of College Stores at campus-bookstores, according to the Trade Association.
Here is the one-of-a-kind for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online just a third of the price for which they are in the campus book shop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be obtained at the specialist textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Needed buy
If you don't make any of the notes of other or normal uses, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed at Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduation student at Brigham Young University, says he spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was resold for $48.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors whether earlier expenses were permissible.
Sometimes the updates for seminars are not relevant.
In such cases, older spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rentals
Hiring textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you don't want to keep the books after the completion of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a repurchased book.
A student, for example, could hire "Ju us" for about $20 each semester.
Inform yourself about the provisions of the business at which you rent, even about criminal charges that may apply to writing notes, subsections or utility lanes.
Add tenants: If you do not return the book, criminal charges may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books, rather than traditional textbooks, are also an option.
Sometimes those books are actually rented by an electronic license for a fixed period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg, you can rent "λ us" for 6 months for approximately $61.
Bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best offers, since many classics can be downloaded for free today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing on books, since one can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is in fact in stock.
That lesson learned he was on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in college bookshop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" became No box-office No.
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only played $12 million of its budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape," directed at Cameron Diaz, played only $14.6 million in the opening weekend, while children's films such as "drag-studs easily made 2" also at revenue.
An article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that children's films may be the reason for the lack of quality in the films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "drawnings easily made 2" as pure "functional" fantasy sequel.
For films for a somewhat older target group, however, it seems as if the quality of films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and metacri-based rating for each summer movie launch, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and in the current year to at least 2,000 screens.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators suggest that development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disappearance's soon appearing jungle book film, said to the website Hollywood Reporter: "I think times change."
We have to accept that and not try to get past the past.
Unlike the currently weak cash returns of the Hollywood productions, Netflix recently posted sales with the streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales were $837 million.
Last summer, the director, Steven Spielberg, criticised the movie studios for focusing too much on filming of comics, and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that its grim prophecy could contain a true core.
In the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions, and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the fall in cash costs recently as simply "cyclical" and told to Hollywood reporters: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema cup at all, and no one will worry more about the business."
This was a step in the right direction, when the second table tennis court was removed a few years ago in order to tighten up the league classification.
Now, the German table tennis club has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga.
As a result, who hasn't risen up, has gone off.
Thus, according to the highest ranking in the league in the Oberliga-Relegation, deity has avoided the descent, playing only five times in the coming season.
Fourth-ranked goalscorers remain ladies, despite their grandiose walkway into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Netherlands league table, as well as the boys of the SC wee.
The SG Lengpers and Torpedo Reservations are joined in the new league table, where the National League is no longer represented by divinity clubs.
At the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the league table, the goal-line second in the National League.
What's left of the composition looks like a better district class, is now the new District League South.
Here are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC.
In the league table, as regional representative Dransfeld and the SC Weending, in the class class of TTC II, Rot-white, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III.
Cronies, the TTC and TTV Geismar II are available here.
In the league table run Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/WöllMarschausen.
With the nine teams each
The SC wee sends his girls to the small district league.
Even the league relay of the SCW boys - there is still Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly established Regionsfederation, the two divinity circuits start with nine teams.
In the West Season, the Rot-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfields SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengern II.
In the East Season there are Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The ladies" league table consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the District of Osterode, where there are no ladies" teams at all at district level.
Striking the fact that none of the six 2.6 class targets is achieved, this is where the innovative and retractable district chief will have to think about it.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
There were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport at the weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds at the center of Newport rallied to an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people arrived in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has followed developments over the weekend and spoken with protesters who have travelled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teens flown out of the Blue Mountains
Two teenage busts have been brought to safety with the cable car after they were captured the night above in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke down shortly after Sunday lunchtime in Govett Leap in Blackheath for her tour.
Worried relatives called police around about 8pm when the two weren't returned home.
A search warrant from local police and emergency services broke and the pair were found around 11pm near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had been injured on the knee and the man had fallen and had his head up.
Emergency crews were left with the couple overnight and they were flown Monday morning.
They were admitted to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalate
The roughly 1,000 protesters were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The station resumed broadcasting after a good half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial.
Deaths or injuries were not reported.
The protesters demand the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police announced that about a kilometre from the residence of the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, on Monday, there were clashes of about 3000 protesters with security forces.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured as protesters tried to penetrate Shariff's residence.
They demand the resignation of the prime minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday night after a meeting at the army headquarters "without time to waste and apply without violence."
It was also stated in the communication: 'The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the State.
The escalating violence has fueled concern over intervention by the military, which has already raced more often in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have been ongoing since Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif rejects resigning.
Khan and Qadri called for their supporters on Sunday to harass.
"We are not going to go back without being forced to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed a similar view.
Khan accuses Sharif of having won parliamentary elections last May through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a caretaker government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters were initially peaceful in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called them up at the weekend to invade Shariff's residence.
Hammers entered three of the table after two starts of the season.
With the 2: 0 above Grödig, for Rapid a bitter week ended a conciliatory end on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an interim chief in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success was very important," confirmed captain and goalscorer Steffen Hofmann, who finished third with Green White.
Schrammel-dreamtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid with the second start of the season, showed the right reaction to the disappointment at Helsinki and goes into the country play-off with a sense of success.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said outfielant Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his superb leadership Volley from the sixth spot in the 14th minute.
"I thought I hau the whole frustration from Thursday's pure and sniffed him under the bar," the 26-year-old said, smiling.
As a scrum on Nov. 13 Nov. 13, 2010, to the last time in a federal ballpark, it was still for Ried.
The first championship game in Rapid-Dress will be remembered in special memory.
"For me this is something very special, I'm from the rapid-offspring," Schrammel said.
Thanks to Mario Pavelic's short-term pellet ligament, Schrammel moved from the left on the right to the right side and made his point very good.
He has enough experience that he can carry out this position in a mirror way.
He has earned the goal, he did a number of assists this year," Barisic praised.
Team show character Schrammel also supplied the flanker to the 2: 0 by Hofmann after good an hour that eventually took the decision.
After all, you would have been able to write to our guests.
"Thank goodness we had some luck today," also noted Schrammel, who has been alluding to the breakup of performance and result in recent weeks: "The results did not vote, but the playoff thing was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games before, you've been better than today" - against "the strongest team to have played this season in this stadium."
The first three-pointer since 26 July proved that the team structure was intact in spite of it: "Today my team showed that it has character."
For him, no less pleasing: "that we finally played back to zero."
A lot of work during the country break Even the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl as well as Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting yards, making the victory even more valuable.
"You mustn't forget this," cautioned Barisic, who lost with Broad and Pavelic Player in the past three days, "which have been very stable lately."
The country break, therefore, must be used to "spit wounds and add a bit in the physical realm," explained Barisic, who has five U21-selections in his ranks.
The captain Hofmann is one who is particularly suited to the break.
He's tearing himself up for the team, going over pain drab.
Especially at this difficult stage, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his draw in the 68th minute not just the structure but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350, Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4: 2 over the Admiralty).
Hofmann: "Let's not believe that now everything is good" "We've certainly had a bit of luck as well, but at some point the happiness must also come back to us.
It was high time now," Hofmann said.
But he warned about focusing further: "You cannot always see black and white.
We haven't played as badly in the last few weeks as this has been portrayed.
We must not, however, believe that everything is good right now.
He could not deny the importance of his role to the team.
It's a very young team I can very much help at the moment.
In certain stages, they are sticking to me," Hofmann said.
Lardig-coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team.
He regretted the quick opposition "out of category magic gate," as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute that was unjustly recognized by referee Colleges.
The only allegation I can make to the team is that we were not specifically enough towards the gate in some phases.
We have had too few qualifications.
Inside defender Maximilian Karner it looked similar: "It started just badly, but we just found it and even made a gate.
By and large, there would have been more in it.
Under this Wizzy, Ruh reigns
We showed a strong tribe at our puzzle task of the summer series "My slice of the Rhöner luck" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the pictured specimen is the "scouring" above of Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600 years old oak.
It goes past koppings, basaltstone and basalt stone.
A step below the quarry of Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, it stands.
The nature monument looks like the other trees in the area and it is reminiscent of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that this is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only references to the namesake.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider studied the Bishop's Archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn in order to learn about what the scourges were.
The result of his inquiries remained the fairly sober explanation for the name.
As a result, up to 80 years ago, the goalkeepers were forced to take their animals from Unterweißenbrunn into the labyrinthine and uncontaminated meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the wild animal keepers should have rested themselves.
In the meantime, the area has regained its significance, as in the meadows, goat herds really do.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found.
When entering the buildings, you should be careful, because the basalt crushed by the sun is also a favourite place for cruises.
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other trails are signposted, the direction of Hochrhön ascend and an extended hike.
Where is the waterburg?
However, a watershed that is being sought in our next assignment is rather rare.
The spider in the ditch gives a good impression of the buildings, but we do have a few historical buildings in the district where the buildings could fit.
Where is our "piece of the Rhöner luck"?

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy's prime minister and EU chairman, Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative opposition to the EU special summit last week pushed the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, and will be successor to British President Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, as the daily newspaper La Repubblica, reflects the appeal of his colleagues in the government team as the favourite Mogherini to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He is also expecting a boost to his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to put the left-wing party in a quiet place against him, as Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit in a moderate way.
Against the Conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the former President of the Council, Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome will make political balance possible.
The EU's chief diplomat will at the same time be deputy president of the President of the Commission, Mr Juncker.
The European Parliament's pending approval is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would have hardly mentioned the nomination of the 41year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) hardly any "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica divulged optimism that, for almost two decades, Mogherini has been able to show the "enormous challenges" to its ambitions and ambitions for its ambition.
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then Democratici di Sinistra (leftists), who were joined by the Catholic Centre Party in 2008 to the current Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European bachelors) for three years.
With the 2001 election in the party council of left-wing Democrats, she rose into the high party politics, working in the foreign affairs department, whose leader she became soon.
It has been known as the Middle East, through studies of NATO involvement in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troop contingent, and the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and to the democrats in the United States have been known.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he berated Mogherini to his foreign secretary.
If, today, the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, contributing to the party's more than 40% vote in the May European elections, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a stake in it.
In Brussels, the new EU foreign envoy has too little diplomatic experience, so in the case of substance, there is a lack of substance.
In Brussels, particularly from Poland and the Baltic Member States, realistic accents of Mogherini are being persecuted for the crisis in Ukraine and as a 'soon-friendly course'.
It is in favour of the South Stream pipeline, led by Russian company Gazprom, which seeks to transport Russia directly to southern Europe directly, bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to protect Italy's energy security.
After Renzi took office as EU chairman in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first visit to Moscow.
Photos that they showed with Putin at the shake-up were greeted with outrage in Brussels, and that they invited the Kremlin leader to a Milan economic summit for October.
A total of nine young people started training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is a Azubi, who has already completed a different training in the company.
In four training offices the new employees are active in the future: Electronic writers (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool-mechanics (two) and procedural mechanics (two).
All the trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Buchl from Blackach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from nine-castle vorm Forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel carefree and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees first visited main or middle schools and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all ages and trainers take part in a team training event to Oberammergau, where there is a full day trip and rafting on the Inn.
The company counts Germany's 435 and world's 950 employees.
The number of trainees from all ages is distributed 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," Francois Hollande's most important ally said.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet collection has come down to disapproval at the large majority of French.
The president deserves all respect, he deserves our loyalty, deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on its side," he said at great applause.
As a appeasement gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his administration would not challenge the controversial 35-hour week in France despite tough calls for a relaxation of the arrangement by Emmanuel Macrons, the new business secretary.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow Democrats to show "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice secretary, strode sand into the gearbox in which she appeared at a meeting of breakaway socialist lawmakers and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in its future."
Marine Le Pen, the far right leader of the National Front, derided the Socialists' constant gravy fight and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has also none, they are forced to form a new government if the old didn't survive a summer.
"And the new one will not survive autumn or winter," Miss Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident of being victorious in early elections and is ready to government.
France's ruling party suffered defeat in local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of French people believe the Socialist Party faces the threat of falling into several rival groups before the end of Chancellor's 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new Socialist government failed to pay any improvement in the economy and the record unemployment rate.
"There's a little window for opportunities, but public opinion needs to make it quick that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise short of a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise operator, is leading advanced negotiations to acquire rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry analysts.
A deal would include Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruises of Prestige Cruises, as well as its wealthier clientele, while it is competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
A settlement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, but warned that the talks could end even fruitless.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment while a spokesman for Apollo declined comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, a 13 percent increase compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to last year.
The cruise industry is overall at about $29 billion and over the next few years is expected for them due to strengthening the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
Companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise line providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
In his current form, Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 by a merger with a cruise operator in the possession of Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock market in January 2013.
Genting held 28 per cent of shares in the end of June, according to registration authorities, Apollo 20 per cent of shares and private equity firm TPG Capital LP a 8 per cent share of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise all have 82% of the passenger capacity on American cruise liners, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the electoral vote.
A peking faithful group waved near the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law on Sunday that allowed just two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nominating committee that is expected to be filled with peking members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote, prompting pro-democracy activists to make their threat and "Occupy Central" protests paralyse Hong Kong's financial location.
Political reforms have long been a controversial topic in Hong Kong; and party leadership fears that the calls for democracy are expanding to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper outlining China's dominance over Hong Kong in June, pro-democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Lis's questioning is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the vice-chairman of the offices of Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists vowed to rally in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the leadership's office in Hong Kong.
Until the end of the 150th century in Hong Kong, Britain did not foresee any democratic elements.
Putin calls for Kiev to capture "sovereign talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government is halting the fighting against separatists in the east of the country and immediately engaged in negotiations for the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, made it clear that Putin did not mean that, under the control of the separatists, the eastern Ukraine is part of Russia, but that its status towards Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to Kiev's government for negotiations on equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits into the strategy that it has been pursuing since the riots began five months ago: Help for the separatists in taking areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia, rather than the West.
In an interview with the state television channel, Putin, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the areas of separatists held in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, taken in March and April, after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on March 18.
In recent times, the Kremlin and the separatists have described the isolated area as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland," a term that is reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary highlight of Russia's empire.
Putin pointed out that all those in the campaign of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on the 26th octopus and, while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the areas of separatists, they are hoping for early peace talks "in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We urgently need to start detailed discussions, not only on technical matters, but also on the political organization of the society and state status of the southeast Ukraine to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood should be seen in the context of the greater autonomy discussed for months by Kiev's leadership to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to eastern areas, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin's clarification of the "misrepresentation" of Putin's remarks underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct attack of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants of ethnic Russians are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict yielded a broad majority for the remains of Ukraine.
Autonomy, raised by Russian diplomats on international forums, would give authority to regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate its own trade agreement and external relations, and so give the Kremlin de facto control of an area that combines Russia's territory with Crimea.
The peninsula, which was annexed five months ago in the Black Sea, is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as a major commercial port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, in his speech on the inauguration of the inauguration on 7 June, suggested that Ukraine's legislation - after new elections - should reflect amendments to the Constitution, which will grant greater control over their own finances and the status of languages in each area.
But his vision of autonomy appears to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and separatist rebels, whose arming and incitement is being blamed for Moscow.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to deal with the separatists on an equal footing followed another advance by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine along the side of the Sea.
The separatists backed by Russia took over in the hand-wringing, according to fears Ukrainian security officials have been the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, control of Nowoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to bind Mariupol, a steel industrial port with a population of 500,000, which lies between Nowoasovsk and narrow access to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and urgently asked for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, an ex-Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are nearing a point where there's no going back," Mr Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of other troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine's territory.
The EU summit did not decide concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft additional sanctions against Russia to come into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Department of Reimports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first likely 63 Ukrainian soldiers, trapped by the Russian incursion into Ilowajsk, were exchanged Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko told AFP on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal involving Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger over hacker who probably stole nude images of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the A-celebrities from Hollywood.
The movie city is in agony after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal over celebrities on the Internet.
The responsible hacker probably has over 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star from "the Tribute of panem" and of superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, reportedly, private photos were allegedly publicised because of an ibio survey.
On the list are 101 celebrities.
Edelsten, who had been jailed last month with Grecko, said against Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and transferred to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "disgraceful" and that the people affected "were hurt."
The hacker probably has 30 images of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two recordings where she is above without a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comment yesterday for the hacked images.
A representative Lawrence's spokesman told TMZ: "It's an atrocious violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing different from the sale of Hehlerware."
In purely legal terms, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers were at the Great Feldberg yesterday on the 8th cycle and have supported the "Help for Created Child Children" Association.
The tour, which was for one goaltending, represented a slight workout for the others.
In one thing, though, everyone agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski is likely to have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus sailed past the field with the bike yesterday.
For the good cause.
It is easy to get rid of the muscle colaters, especially as they took a valuable insight into the work on the 8th cycle on the Great Feldberg in favour of the "Help for Created Children" Association (Frankfurt).
A great thing.
"I know now that I can do this - prima!"
Small puns on the road in the applause curve?
Snow if I'd stopped, wash's out from it
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler City Council, many of the 718 contestants were agonised in the mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
For others, it was easier to overcome the good eleven km long stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The whole thing in red - red dress, red bike - made the start yet something on understatement ("Every crowd of professionals, there's been an end to the goal!"), but turned out to be half a professional and went after 45 minutes without any breathing problems.
He too drove the track in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press secretary in the town of Oberursel, who had been on the road together with Frank Green.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "Here it's all about Charity, because we are happy with it, we would have made an exit today," Kuhn.
On the way, they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) was rushed to Oberursel in the morning to get straight back to the heights.
At 9 a.m. at home in the saddle, the Frankfurter Florian Zierz "made" the Feldberg two times to roll back home.
Fun also had "Fritten-Toni."
For the head of the Oberurer cult kiosks, bike tours through the Feldberg are simple.
He had pinned down with his 6.5-kilorace bike 40 minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose, I am happy to do so," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself being an "ambitious racing rapper."
He must also be, because he was travelling with the "Fixie-Rad," although these are also racing wheels, but without circuitry
That even without a bike, it proved not only the 20 hikers who stepped up to the summit over the White Wall and the Fugue Chapel, but also a jogger who, at a cordel, had a car tyres behind their feet.
Mountain watch doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who provided with his team, equipped with all-wheel bully and Quad, for safety, said: "The kenn "I from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sleigh ride, just that he pulls out the sledge himself," so the man is somehow his own sleight of hand.
The 718 contestants - and therefore as many as ever - were sent to groups on the track in the morning.
The hikers first about 9.30.
It was followed by the first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later the first mountain bikers were left.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the club "Radeln on the Great Feldberg," gave the start commutes and wished the participants a nice outing.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the track to the Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
