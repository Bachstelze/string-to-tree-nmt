`` As trade unions die , they are also dying , &apos;&apos; said the ad hoc , which was said to be .
this is why I am proud to say .
this groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal capacity for discrimination for the organisation of trade unions such as other forms of discrimination .
in addition to this , it is necessary to create an opportunity for discrimination , in order to create an opportunity for discrimination .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - not American standards .
in fact , the best way to understand is what is suggested by a large number of companies .
in spite of the setbacks that have been suspended in recent years , the trade unions have been encouraged by countries around the country - American countries in all over the world .
there was a time to remember millions of Americans , as this country was democracy , freedom of speech , the freedom of the press , and the rest in a breath .
when the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War , General Douglas , General Douglas , Mac Arthur , and his staff are serving the country to adopt a constitution that would make sure that the accounts that had been issued would be replaced by democracy .
in full awareness , the workers and their trade unions used to play a role in the creation of a new Japan , using a language that explicitly recognised that `` the rights of workers in association and common are guaranteed to act and act . &apos;&apos;
when the United States joined Germany after the Second World War , General pushed out in charge of the number of votes in Germany and had the Germans to write a constitution that would make sure that Adolf Hitler &apos;s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy .
in recognition of the fact that workers would have to organise , and their voice in the new nation should raise , the Germans added a clause that said explicitly : ` The right to establish associations to ensure that labour and economic conditions are guaranteed and improved is guaranteed to each individual and to each profession .
agreements restricting this right or aimed at reducing it is zero and void .
as the former First Lady of the International Human Rights Commission , which drafted the General Declaration of Human Rights , as was accepted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the other authors make a guarantee that everyone has the right to form trade unions or to join them . &apos;&apos;
for generations , Americans have been accepting the fact that they are home to right-wing human rights .
as this country , there are other countries where there can be civilian and democratic societies , Americans said that the right to establish a union is right - and that is that this trade union should then be able to take part in a ad hoc partner with companies and companies .
since these rights in America have come under fire , it is indeed very wise to remember the American ideal , meaning that the working population must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society .
as said in fifty years in front of the priest Martin Luther King .
history is a great one .
now , everyone knows that the strength of the nation does not make the strength of the nation , but they are doing so .
by increasing the standard of living of millions of people , work has created a market for industry and has raised the entire nation in terms of making the nation available .
those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but history preserves them .
history is reminiscent and we should also do so .
the formal recognition of the right to human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens &apos; rights , is long overdue .
in the past , in the past , he was born in New York in New York .
judges stop temporarily in law that everyone could force to close down to the closure .
on Sunday , for the time being , the implementation of a law in Arizona , by the lawyers , has probably meant that it would probably have led to the closure of all five of the five in charge of the state of the state .
this measure , which has been collected by the Chairman of the law , Governor of Arizona , in June and is supposed to be in force on 1 January , would force doctors to carry out abortion , to force them to buy and to acquire a 30 % stake in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles .
however , the decision of the judge means that the doctors can continue to carry out legal abortion while applying for such a right .
`` The contracting parties can follow their duties , as they try to obtain these rights , &apos;&apos; wrote the official in his judgment in his judgment .
within a month , there will be a hearing for the judge , in order to make the law available for the law .
in addition to similar measures , in a series of judgments against similar measures , the decision to make doctors get so much time means that doctors can obtain as much time as possible .
`` The decision today means that the women in Arizona can escape from an ad hoc law that wants to take their health and rights , &apos;&apos; said Nancy , President and Chairman of the Centre for Understanding , said to be held in the name of three of the five hospitals in the state , said to stop the law .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment was also taken to the doctors in two clinics , which did not connect to the complaint and had also applied for the right to use .
Arizona is one of 11 countries that have issued similar laws , with courts recently declared such measures in the fields of Columbia and the Americas .
in Texas , most of the clinics used in the state were stopped on Friday .
in addition to this , we believe that we will be able to find out more about this .
there is still an awareness of the measures aimed at protecting the health of women , although some of them also have an impact on the closure of clinics .
only one doctor who carries out abortion in Arizona has real estate that has real estate .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to carry out more abortion , this doctor would no longer be able to carry out the operation , said the group .
in her argument against the judgment , representatives of the state said that they would not punish doctors because of the execution of abortion , while their applications would be able to be able to do so in the same way .
there is also a lot of access to the best practices in rural areas in rural areas .

Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis , of the type of the example of the company is also the social and economic status , as well as the social and economic status .
for older women and those who had already advanced cancer , they were lowest .
for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , there were 20 % higher than for those in question .
although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with higher probability of risk , Dr. Jordan claims that there is a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best possible factors as possible factors for this .
`` This disease is treated in the best way to be treated in larger cities , &apos;&apos; she said .
in spite of the improvement in the situation , in spite of the improvement of the distances , they proposed to make a better use of the service in the service sector , which means that there is a need for an increase in the service of highly qualified doctors , who can help specialists to supply women to their homes .
Dr. Jordan said that , regardless of the geographical status , the study independently recommends a poor approach to the number of women in the case of female women and highlighted the need for better treatment and frequently used projects .
the study carried out by Rio is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
in March 2013 , in March 2013 , there has been a number of very young people , a young mother of 33 years , from the point of view that they had had an aggressive form of sound .

in the evening to 21 p.m. , additional rain fell to the city , according to the amount of time that took place in the night for Sunday .
the final outcome has been the result of a series of very short deadlines , which were the result of a series , including a very short run , which began a short time ago at 20 p.m. and in about 10 minutes was caused by almost two minutes .
after the winter had taken last week for an early dose , temperatures in the city fell again on Monday in front of only 8 ° C
the resulting weather conditions are probably likely to lead to the delayed landing of the flight of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Casablanca .
the plane had to land shortly after 7.30 p.m. , but it was taken by a similar wind - a sudden change in the speed of the race would be started over a short distance - and they had to start .

in view of the fact that technical progress , which threatens to turn our attention to home , threatens to turn home into an ad hoc situation in terms of space , we believe it is true that Bernd is an expert with an extremely familiar electronic accessories .
while I am writing this , I have a look at the example that connects the listener with the phone and I think I think .
however , there is no reason for this : if the cable would not be , that in the shortest possible time all listeners would be able to fly in the house .
in any case , what happens in the case of the company , which is in existence ?
no , there is the rule , which is generally purchased , which has been purchased .
and for example , for example , today there is still one of the most popular in the living room , which says that they are basically opposed to television .
so why these considerations ?
because in this week we can push our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics .
there is no longer the purpose of the company , which is previously washing machine and holding players , but today does n&apos;t even understand the purpose of the devices that can be extended by means of the so many times they can be added to him .
yes , there is still something to do ?
what is to be said about people who seem to spread voluntarily ?
in fact , for about 20 years now , it is important that we should link our house to our house .
that &apos;s why you can order yourself for yourself .
and would it not be wonderful if we were able to leave from the office to our early arrival ?
yes , however , there is a need for air conditioning .
but a dream is definitely going to be true : we continue to raise our position .

your party demands that the companies that are currently taking advantage are currently at the disposal of companies that are currently in existence .
96 refugees can be placed in the three tents .
for example , the reasons for the provision in question are due to the fact that there can be no shortage of seats , as is the fact that the authorities can not provide sufficient places in facilities
many refugees are therefore longer than the regular three months .

in an opinion to the new press , he is contrary to the statements made by the act of the act of peer .
the style of the university is not , I say , in the communication .

whether the criticism of the act in question is the one that can be found , with the extension of the road , one of the few who would be lost would be lost , &apos;&apos; the reader can decide for itself . &apos;&apos;
at the beginning of October , in cooperation with the State of Applied Sciences , there is a need for information about how to inform us .
together with peer review last week , the parents informed parents about the plans of the university .
this means that the access to the new is not supposed to be in place .
this means that the narrow roads would have to be expanded in about one kilometre .

I have some health sites that I can not ignore
I have never had the proper control of the number I had in 2012 , in line with the three measures that have taken place in 2012 .
in this respect , there are a number of other related complaints .
already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I can control my head .
for a comeback , it would only be available in absolute emergency .

lenny Henry : my father has never taken me into the arm .
has never said `` I love you
Henry was one of the seven children who had a family .
his father , who died when Henry 19 was , worked in a factory and its relationship .
Henry for a comedy , in part , is Records , which was founded in part on an un@@ settled conversation with his father and was created in the series on Radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mixture of pop music and a lot of fun , with lively melodies .
but Henry had to work through some of the most difficult ways of working with .
he visited `` many &apos;&apos; therapies after the death of his mother , and Henry is his father &apos;s relationship over his relationship with his father .
it was hard to know him .
you have never seen his face , but he just heard his voice .
let your sister be quiet .
let us get away !
I would like to look at fighters .
my older brothers had a lot of money and Hilton - who were already born when I was a child went with him with him and spoke about things , such as the shape of the object it is it or the beauty of an already paid service .
I have never had such a conversation with him .
most of my life was he this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper .
recently , Henry opened a series of good and won , and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father , he won an insight into how life had been for him .
it is now a bit lighter , but they are dark , it is dark , there is a lot of money .
my father had previously put himself in the bath and then you were able to listen to him , as he started to sing , because he was able to wash the box .
when I was running there , I was quite clear that he had done for years to bring the food to the table .
however , as a child , Henry grew up in charge of his parents .
my father never let me know me , he said never . &apos;&apos;
we began to say , `` I love you , I love you .
because of his own daughter , he was able to tell him that he had missed the love that he had missed as a child .
do you want to test with us ?
for example , let me say that I am poor !
I am 22 !
with Dawn French .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still alive in French , with whom he was married for 25 years .
Babylon is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
the company &apos;s own mother was one of those who took part .
that helped in her death .
so when I was very much in charge , my doctor said I had to be radical .
so I moved through this and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is challenging .
no one is happy to eat .
there may be a lot of money that can be found here .
since he was praised by the critics , he is in front of the theatre .
it followed the comedy of the leaves , and then took part in August Wilson .
this is another experience that has been completed .
he started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a DJ discovered him on the scene and wrote to him about him .
`` I was in the middle of the 1970s in the middle of the 1970s . &apos;&apos;
he learned in the profession .
I had to learn not only in the eyes of the public , but also from 1975 to 1985 , as I was able to carry out an efficient system that was efficient , while I was a star on television , as I was really difficult to do .
lenny in 1975 in New York
as his manager was right in front of the Black and White , he had a nice entertainment program in which the people of black were old . &apos;&apos; Henry led his comedy there over five years .
my family was very uncomfortable .
I would somehow wish that it would never happen , but I am not sure that I have done .
there has been an ad hoc and unpleasant position for me , but I worked on a large number and learned how to deal with a large audience .
but this `` years of years of great light of British television &apos;&apos; has also been a `` that has been . &apos;&apos;
through the introduction of figures that celebrated the British black culture , Henry worked on an alternative to an alternative .
the first series of Lenny Henry Show took place in 1984 and was also known as the chef .
`` What can you do ? &apos;&apos; what you are doing : `` What are you doing next ? &apos;&apos;
after that , there was a box for Radio 4 with the title What Is Great Great ?
the first episode was about Shakespeare .
in Shakespeare , I was really one of them .
I had never learned about him in school and had mainly had him for a domain of the middle class .
so I am very afraid of this .
all of us who we had for the show for the show for the show , Peter Hall , in front of the show n , Adrian said to say I had to try .
do n&apos;t do it bad if you do not know what you are doing .
take a couple of words in the mouth , and then you will understand why we love Shakespeare .
Henry performed 20 lines of record and he was enthusiastic about the documentary and he was enthusiastic .
I had the feeling that I was able to create .
it was almost as if someone had finally given me the head .
`` What is it it is a serious matter .
the samples were brutal and I read this piece for months before we made it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect to expect to expect to expect .
and soon he took part in the comedy &apos;s comedy .
suddenly , I was in the box and I could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when I thought `` Oh , you changed you . &apos;&apos;
there was a technical error and Henry felt that he had to wait for the audience .
`` A little voice told me that you have to bridge 10 minutes , while they fix the computer . &apos;&apos;
instead , the event announced that the idea would be better if the problem has been resolved .
I went from the stage and something in me said `` Oh , thank God .
I am not responsible .
I can leave that to someone else .
`` You are playing in one of his roles , that is .
Henry in a series of books held in hall .
it was challenging to learn about the text .
panic is very good , and that strengthens the line .
that too was well , so there is a great sign of the gods who say unto me . &apos;&apos;
he says this , of course , with a vote in favour .
so I stand in this .
I really do so .
I love to be in a similar space .
however , Henry is still in charge of the head of an act - our conversation is always covered by full force , while he continues to make people again .
I have decided not to throw out the use of any kind , because I believe that this type of immediate satisfaction is somehow dangerous .
if you are looking for something like this , you can get in front of a wall .
I sometimes go live in the Apollo if I want to do so , but in general I am not as much as before .
I would like to ask him if he will ever be able to take part .
the fun I have in a space with a director who helps to make a start , a start and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I want to give up .
does this mean that this is something that can be found here ?
I think so .
I &apos;m happy to be an actor .
it is fun .
you are always talking about history and that is great .
I love stories .
people love stories .

and it has its own side of the same way .
her career began at the global record act of taking advantage and Co . .

not only does the BBC stand as a vast and complex unit in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
there is two ways to do so : in the first instance , the first guard on the first guard of his own can be used in the BBC , but there is also public concern in the BBC , as well as the voice of public concern , when things are running wrong .
this means that there is an equivalent of almost one , in line with a complete set of reforms , which is called for .
but what a new president would risk would risk taking everything and increasing an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , whereas he may get his job .
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many are still interested in seeing the BBC to see power , money and status .
while competition is moving closer and new technologies threaten old and convenient safeguards , the forthcoming negotiation of the press licences for the BBC is linked to special dangers .
for the modest sum of € 50 £ 50 per year , the British public is buying most of the world .
the BBC tells us a good story : it says that it reaches 96 % of all households and costs only 40 per day per day .
and apparently , the BBC is rising again in line with the above mentioned : 53 percent support them today , compared to 31 % less than 10 years ago .
they have changed - and they have changed their way for the BBC : I &apos;m now in charge of playing on my mobile phone and see well designed programs later on my record player .

she needs an overwhelming chairman - I hope she has found him .

it was deleted later and has been replaced by another user account , which is the previous one .
it has just been sent out by my account , which was not authorised by me .
`` I do not approve and deleted it , &apos;&apos; said the later news .
not immediately due to requests for comments .
in spite of the fact that there was a lot of money , there is still no doubt about who is actually using the feed .
in the earlier in the past , the company has been given an ad hoc description of the company , the equivalent of what has been said , and the equivalent of the number of services that can be found in April 2013 .
Perry placed a veto against financial support for their offices , when they refused to resign , which could be a charge against Perry - who could be 2016 - before a Grand jury this month .
the text of the label is the text , which says : `` I do not always go up to make use of what I &apos;m doing , but when I do it , I &apos;m doing so , but when I do it , I &apos;m going to do so .
I &apos;m the place that is home in Texas in Texas .
there was nothing to do with the research of the Grand jury against Perry .
this was carried out by Michael at a height of 1 @/@ 8 , which had been selected by a Republican judge .
Mr Perry is not guilty and said that the charges were a political trick .
in the case of the case , there is also a number of people who believe that they should be able to use them .
Perry pays 7.5 million dollars of state money to the public &apos;s public equivalent unit of state - which is located in publicly owned county and is determined in cases of state corruption in Texas .
this veto resulted in a public complaint on the part of a group in question .

your feet do not do so .
I would like to say that I would like to thank you for your remarks .
and if you are running , what happens to me because I am too thick ?
are you in charge ?
of course , I am not .
that is merely the fact that I have had in mind .
he might say ` I love you &apos; , but for that it was too early .
`` They are exactly the reason for me , &apos;&apos; says a lot of money .
I am in favour of this .
that is not correct .
it was supposed to be in question .
when he tried to be in charge , he was often in trouble because , like his father , he was not able to end up over the cover , which he had needed to make sure that he had had the cruelty to that in place .
perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he wanted to be a matter for those who took part .
in spite of his friendly eyes .
in addition to this , there is also a lot of space that can be found in many of the most important areas of the world .

not that I am not .
she was tired of him , both in the light of his words and because of the fear that showed himself in her eyes when she rejected him .
did they think that he would beat them ?
she did not tell him about the life of the cold northern archipelago , where she grew up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially as was here .
there is also a very large number of islands in front of the sea .
in the same way , the same number of men , with an still different body of the skin , took advantage of the fact that they had taken advantage of their ancestors in the same way , as they had been their ancestors as their ancestors as their ancestors as their ancestors as their ancestors as their ancestors as their ancestors in front of their ancestors and they had been involved in

they would have shown a thick ass if they did n&apos;t fit in !
you had only had the most common word used to use the most commonly used word for a frequently used word for a similar attraction for a similar appeal between men and women .
in the same way , there is no doubt about the fact that there has been an increase in violence , given that there is already an act of violence .
in his body , there was an indication of his body .
he grew up out of the hand@@ ball of St like an old man .
she also felt himself , but she was able to take part in his sorrow of his sorrow .
that was not the end of the world .
they did not know .
she saw him , as he did - as in a room in the upper floor he saw him in the place of his own - a man , because of something that he had accused of himself .
Adam leaves the garden , thought them .
she felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands .

when she was again , he looked at his feet in front of her feet .
for a number of years , there were many years in the order of the company , which had been conducted by the company , which , in a short talk about the continued violence at low and fixed levels , has taken place in exactly the same way that the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence has been lost .
there has already been a lot of work and much has to be done , &apos;&apos; she wrote , `` she wrote , &apos;&apos; for example , she wrote , `` To raise the number of thousands of wars , and most won , in particular in the remote corners and valleys of the country , in those of the sweet breath of human kindness , in places that have seldom been felt

the higher the price of the card , the less the passion he continues to raise .
the population in terms of language , in terms of listening , gives rise to stories about the virtues of marriage and family life , but there is still evidence of the emergence of new and new ways that can be found at home , but there is also evidence of the emergence of new and new ways that can be found at home .

this is an equivalent of free work .
we are serving as an alternative to free society .
however , there are often evidence that can be distorted , however , as you have said .
you yourself seem to have prejudice to the Church , and these things , which you call as ` the ` I have to say &apos; - could be interpreted by others as well as expression , of course , as an expression of strength and vitality .

I am concerned that we may find ourselves in line with us , as we repeat , as we repeat .
this time , however , is not the one that we can make to our anger and mistrust .
in his hands , he had a great deal of experience .
to do so , there is now a question of what is called for .
`` They go too far , &apos;&apos; he said .
they go too far when you say that they had their `` anger &apos;&apos; and their ` mistrust &apos; .
it should not be necessary , in your opinion , to remember that we are not talking about us , as is the protection of the present .
there was no ` we &apos; and there was no `` others . &apos;&apos;
there has been a period of time and that is all we know .
`` From that when we are honest with ourselves , &apos;&apos; in fact , `` Do n&apos;t raise part of society to say that they can well behave .
I do not like to do so .
whether or not it has been done , what has happened has happened .
that was then .
nothing more needs to be said - we agree .
and , as far as no fault has to be allocated , there is also no need to blame for blame , if such a situation would be reasonable and if there is a way , they should be placed in motion .
but what is the past if we do not learn from it ?
the past is that we forget it .

it says that there is no longer a coup in South Africa which is planned in South Africa .
official representatives of the military , in Tunis , went on to plan a coup and said that they went against police officers who have been accused of being accused of doing so .
Prime Minister Thomas fled from the country and said that the army of the country has occupied the home of the land in the capital and the number of buildings in the capital .
the Premier brought his family into the neighbouring South of South Africa .
in response to the fact that there is de facto no coup , the military said that the military had a threat to the threat of `` political back@@ ers of the `` political parties &apos;&apos; who stood by the police .
`` what happened this morning is that the staff of the company &apos;s attention was the same as the one in the police , after he had received several elements that operate within the police , and in fact there were some elements within the police who actually wanted to see some of the political young young young students who had briefly to find devastating damage that had been lost
there is also a lot of money that can be found .
although no one has claimed that the government has taken control of itself , all reports agree that the activities of the un@@ armed forces of Ceuta so far show signs for a coup
on Sunday , the army shared the army on Sunday that the soldiers have placed themselves in charge and are quiet in the capital .

production in the euro zone on an asset in terms of a number of companies
in August , the increase in production in the euro zone is the lowest point in the last 13 months , as noted in the last 13 months of the year .
in August , in August , it fell to the tune of 0.7 in August in August , following a state of 1.8 in July .
an indication of 50 gives an extension .
new orders went back and experienced factories in a period of rising tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
the figures are made before the meeting of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- on Thursday .
the markets expect the Bank to find a clear plan for dealing with a remote recovery of the eurozone and the threat of deflation in a rate of inflation .
there is speculation that the leader of the ECB , Mario Draghi , could make further information over this week as to whether he is considering quantitative relief for the eurozone , according to those made by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than no growth , the benefits of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty have become clearer for the manufacturers .
Russia &apos;s largest trading partner for Germany , the largest trading partner in the EU , fell at the lowest level in 11 months .
in the meantime , in the second largest of the block , fell in the block of the block , France .
in fact , France remains an asset in terms of stagnation , as is the descent of Italy from a sound expansion to stagnation .
there is also evidence of the fact that , in the case of the so many cases in Germany , as well as in Spain and the Netherlands , is no longer reassuring .
the decline in industry is probably probably the fire of analysts that await further monetary or economic incentives .
there was a positive message from the Republic of Ireland , where I had the highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard said that the best thing you can to say in August is that the sector will continue to grow .
he added that , at present , producers in the eurozone find their lives quite difficult , as the current rise in geopolitical tensions , particularly in terms of Russia and Ukraine , will increase uncertainty in the difficult conditions in many countries .
this increase in uncertainty has clearly affected the economy - in particular , consumer confidence is likely to be delayed or cancelled , in particular .
he said that it will always be more likely that the ECB finally needs to initiate a kind of QE , &apos;&apos; although we suspect that this is limited . &apos;&apos;
there are ten years to do so , for example , in the case of the survivors of Beslan : ten years have passed since the show and children are still suffering today .
ten years ago , over 1,000 people from Chechen militias were taken as hostages in a school in Beslan .
more than 330 people , more than half of them , have been killed in the box .
we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had fallen in the classroom in the classroom .
just a decade after the appalling siege of the school of Beslan , in which 34 000 people came to power , including 186 children , the number of survivors shall be responsible for survivors of last night in front of a new round in Ukraine .
in the beginning of September 2004 , in the beginning of September 2004 , on 1 September 2004 , children and parents on 1 September 2004 , who took part , appeared to be an act of evil .
the tragedy united West and East in dis@@ quiet , and then transformed itself into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
ten years later , we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had fallen in the classroom .
we found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hell is going to follow .
your greatest hope ?
that the war that Ukraine is now looking for - and in the children that they die - an end .
the girl who was photographed in the experiment was able to climb up .
she was photographed by the Russian company and made famous , as she only tried to do in her .
he was completely confused by his mother , her mother , for 40 years of age .
both had been kept dead , but they lived .
`` A woman said to me that I had to run my life , but I was not able to say .
I had to follow my legs .
I stood for myself and took care to search for my mother .
there was a soldier in safety .
after a series of operations , she was able to heal , but yesterday said : `` three months ago , the pain returned .
I fear that I have to operate again .
some of them are still in my knees .
their aim is now to make the number of people available , in order to help people , as helped by doctors .
`` This tragedy changed my life , but it has failed to tell me , &apos;&apos; she says .
that is what happened , and that can not be changed
once in the year , I always go into the box to remember those who have stayed there .
my friends and I try not to talk about it in other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future , as well as future , was killed in a number of places in place that had been killed .
we played together when we were small , and they were able to go together with school .
`` I do not want to marry until I finish my study and start my career .
I later think of a family .
she says that the siege will always remain part of it , although the memory of each year is rather weak .
I am glad that many people in the world remember our horror and we are so grateful for the help that we have received from people in the UK and everywhere else .
when I see the photo of me online , as I see in the school I see that many people see it for the first time , and I think that many people see it for the first time to understand our disaster and to make sure that this does not happen again .
the boy who fled to his mother was dead , in the opinion .
it was his first record day -LRB- Russians go in school with 7 years in school -RRB- .
as he said , he said that he said that if there was an explosion , I had to say that I have had an explosion .
after an explosion , he thought she would die .
she said to him : `` Run . &apos;&apos;
full of fear , they can be dead , fled him and saw on the way of a running that can be used to be dead .
his father , Vladimir , who joined his son outside , said that his mother died that his mother died .
he said : `` I could not save them . &apos;&apos;
in fact , there has been a lot of money to be found in the hospital , for example , in hospital , in the hospital , in turn , in the assumption that their son had come to life .
after their reunification , they said : `` I am happy to rejoice .
I could not believe it .
he ran in and gives me a lot of money .
he was born in London in London -LRB- since then , he was the official newspaper News of the World -RRB- , in order to get the title of the title of a race to the Children &apos;s Club from the then Premier Tony Blair and his wife .
`` This horror is followed by every day , but I wish , I could stop with the cause of saying he said yesterday .
however , I can say that in my memory , it is put in motion .
I still know that I was directly in charge .
now , however , I can now play games and play games .
`` I am not afraid of the fact that there are some of them , but I do not think about myself .
I remember these children , which I played in the farm , who have not managed out there .
we never say that they were killed or dead .
we say that they have remained in the box .
I remember very well in my trip to London , especially in line with the car , where I was able to choose what I wanted .
but now he is afraid of places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of disaster that he and his friends have suffered .
this horror is followed by every day , but I wish I could stop reminding me .
`` I am so sorry for all those who suffer as a result of the issues in question , &apos;&apos; said last week , who worked in a monastery last week .
I would like to help .
I will go to the police and hope that they will take me next year .
his mother in question , 48 , said : `` 37 children were killed in our neighborhood , can you imagine ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there were simply no children who were able to use , and this silence took many months .
it is well reminiscent of their journey to London .
the people in London were ten times higher than I told our history .
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support .
she was grateful for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004 .
I would wish , I could call a lot of money and I simply say that 10 years have passed , but I still remember the meeting of me and his man in London , as I have helped to do .
I still remember what I had to say I would like to say to you .
I remember how he played in a restaurant in a restaurant .
and that was only one month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British shared our pain and supported us .
she said : `` I always think that this world has not been better in these 10 years .
in Ukraine the war is now and every day people are dying and I believe that many children were killed and are still killed .
these are exactly such children as ours .
I think that for many of the war there is part of the news that they hear when they are busy or with something else .
I simply know what these people feel like .
and I can not stop to feel that
nothing has changed , people always want to kill each other and that is so sad .
there has been a great deal and it is a very good and quiet boy , who is certainly not aggressive or angry .
for example , he is not looking for revenge , he is not overwhelmed by the past .
I know that he does not like to remember , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go into the show and the candles of the candles .
when he was smaller , he suffered , I remember , as he sometimes put himself on the sofa .
not to end up , his eyes were open .
I still remember how he continued to raise all his weapons and charges .
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again .
when I came to front of the explosion , I saw me , and I saw hell around me .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could have survived .
`` I remember that I was able to do so , `` I &apos;m sure , &apos;&apos; I am sure that he has not heard me .
but he has heard and he has gone there .
and so the life is different than that of many others .
in the same year , I was able to return to him , as I had to say .
the boy to see the symbol of the siege in front of the siege to the symbol of what happened in Beslan .
comfort : the company in question that has been , in response to the fact that they are living in the same way , they will be able to find themselves today .
he is afraid to see his life , as he was afraid of his life .
his picture has been one of the most commonly used symbols for the barbar@@ ity of Beslan .
his mother , his mother , had his mother , 54 , who had put him in charge , before she had started to bring her to the university .
`` I left the yard for about two minutes before the terrorists put him in charge , and so my little boy remained there for three terrible days alone .
not at all , as a whole family of relatives was , but they were all killed .
only one of my own managed to survive .
the closer this date , the harder it is to think and talk about it .
there is no single day in which we do not remember this tragedy .
we do not think that it is long , I think it had happened yesterday , some scenes took place in these days and I follow myself .
no one will forget , I promise you .
hence : the image of the number -LRB- left -RRB- was one of the most commonly used pieces of attack and was created as a statue -LRB- right -RRB- .
I remember that in this day I would like to go to school and say that he wishes to see his teacher in poor .
I first knew that he was alive when I saw him on television .
and now there is even this statue of the end of a lot in San Marino .
the picture does n&apos;t like to see and it is hidden at home .
I understand that , but I also understand that people all over the world feel our pain .
today it is said today : `` It is important that can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we are ever experiencing the truth .
people always examine such tragedies and have never seen the truth .
and now they investigate the crash of these Boeing in Ukraine .
will we ever learn what caused him ?
this world is becoming something that is too different .
`` I can not understand how is possible
there is nothing at all for such pain .
we need dozens of years to forget a small little bit .
it has attacked my health and I still feel .
for about three or four years , I had a couple of fans because of the siege , but then it was better .
I went back to school in 2004 and were afraid of all day .
I thought of my friends and record number that had been killed .
that is why I am always going to go into the box when 1 September is approaching .
I would like to pay tribute to mine .
it is hard for me to go into the box , but I have to do so .
I am not the victim , this story is now part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I do not like I .
my life continues .
I graduated in the school this year and visit a medical college in the company in front of the company .
I will be able to put an end to the fact that I am there .
my first choice was an education in the army .
I wanted to be a soldier , but my health did not .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
for example , as we can say , Mr President , Mr President , Mr President , Mr President , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are now so many people who want to travel in Europe .
the boy who lived lived , although he was trapped at the feet of an evil terrorist .
a miracle : to be part of the siege during the siege , it was buried in the siege , but he managed to survive .
during the siege , he was caught in the box and sat next to the bomb that was attached at the foot of an evil terrorist .
it is really a miracle that he was not killed .
`` We feel as if it had been yesterday , &apos;&apos; he says that he said that he was able to go to the FSB , given that he had not been able to do so because of the damage caused by the siege .
it is still with me , it is nothing I left behind me .
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say - .
`` in 2006 , I worked with psych@@ ologists and indeed I felt a bit better , but I ca n&apos;t forget .
and I would like to forget .
in 2005 - in the year - this was the first and only time that I went into the box .
I lost awareness .
I will never come back and ask me to show you , where I have had food in this famous picture .
for example : a photo in the hospital , in the hospital after the siege on the laptop .
my pain is enormous and I wear him every day .
my friends know that I am not happy to think about it and they never asked for me after school .
I think it is good .
I should be careful , but now I can do well .
but because of my health , I have not been able to study the FSB in St. Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have my documents , and I have also replied to the medical staff and they have replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so I went to the medical institute .
I have already had two years behind me .
he learns to treat all animals from cats .
he said : `` I knew that I would never report to my children .
children should not know and of course they should not suffer .
his mother , Marina , said : `` This pain leaves me never .
it is worse in my soul when the anniversary is approaching .
I shall go to the celebrations of remembrance .
I know that is not going to go away .
it has to be much more intense for him , because he was there and I do not .
I waited at home and could not help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned .
it remains in us .
there is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is hard to accept that if there is something that can be said to be fair .
he is a boy , he may be sport , but he can not participate in his knees
he has operated several times , but he can do so , but he does not drive sport .
I would say that he has overcome the horror at 50 % , but I can never forget and forget that .
this terrible experience is always going to follow .
many friends and neighbors were killed at the siege and that only increases my pain .
I have lost many people who I knew well and were expensive .
my son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that God could make me make , but my heart is my heart of t t to the cover .
I know of families in which new children were born , but also those who have never had the time that took place .
it is hard to accept that life continues , even if you do not want it .
I will never forget what my heart was in me when I saw him in the hospital .
and now I see what happens in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why do they kill each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe that .
we were previously a friendly country , which can be that we are now fighting ?
people and children suffer , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are killed .
if we were able to use all of these rebels , let alone as far as possible .
there is also a number of people who believe that they are still there .
the baby that has been worn in safety
saved : in addition to this , there is also a large number of restaurants in the city .
it is now ten -LRB- right -RRB- .
the world held the breath in 2004 when the baby was brought to the poor in the poor of a Russian police from the siege of Beslan .
the terrorists let them go , but , in their cruelty , they held their home of the mother , who had a large number of years and returned to her brother .
there were three years of age , but at the time there were three years of age .
since then , her father has since again had a lot of money since then and has had a small girl with his new wife for a small girl that he has been mentioned after his lost daughter .
there are ten years old that is ten years old than the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl .
`` They are now a great happy family and a lot of great pleasure , &apos;&apos; says great children , `` say a close friend .
in the same way , it is possible to get all sorts of information that can be found in the event .
they will understand why .

there is also a large amount of money that can be found here .
it is accused of being accused of driving a girl on the transition to the transition in East in East .
there is a charge for him , and he has controlled his Audi and injured 3 without the necessary care and attention and the girl was injured .
Stewart , 78 , , out of the same way , is responsible for making a lot of money .

4 tips for better images photos and videos .
if you want to make photos or videos under water , there is a selection of equipment .
in addition to this , there is also a large number of companies in the world .
I have recorded these photos at a special with several cameras that are all at a price of less than $ 350 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
control your equipment twice .
even if you have a tight camera , make sure you are still closed .
put your camera on the photos or videos you want .
a number of cameras and cameras are equipped with the same time and high performance of the company , which can be used to optimize the performance .
and before you jump , check out the depth of your equipment .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , with up to 50 or 60 feet .
search in our secure guide and see the reviews for digital cameras .
make sure you take part - because many are not going to work .
there is also an LCD TV that can be used to create images .
even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to view this under water and the right one is a matter that can be found .
so you are making many recordings .
when your camera has a space that can be used , you can use a series of images .
stay close to the surface .
the light is dramatically worse than you remove from the surface .
if possible , you will be close to the surface if you are looking for pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
in this way , you can also bring more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also a good advice to the country , but it is all the more important because of the bad ones .
it is particularly important if you are working with one of them : these devices often have a fixed number of companies , which means that you have to get closer to your objects , if they are to be filled in to the whole .
Andrew &apos;s son was a man of the variety whose character changes things , even in a giant organization such as that .
he dedicated his career to his career in saving the sick , both to the disease and also to the treatment of treatment .
among his patients , for example , his wife was reminded that he was an experienced employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture .
there is an awareness of the fact that the doctors are important in terms of disease and disease , while there is mostly something similar to the fact that they are mainly related to pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one who started to go away .
`` I did n&apos;t feel , &apos;&apos; he wrote in May this year .
I had difficulties to do so .
he noted that he had made him impati@@ ent to his wife .
`` I want everything better than later .
when you were a person et et for a week , there was no doubt that he had been able to find himself .
something was in the air .
he asked one of his colleagues to carry out his chest .
two weeks ago he was in the French Alps .
the result of the screening was there .
he suffered in charge of a lot of money , with an increase in the amount of cancer that occurs in the event .
as with most cancer , the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine .
for example , for example , for example , some of them have been affected by the fact that they had previously been smokers .
in other words , however , there is no doubt that it is different .
in almost all cases , the trigger is an equivalent that can be found - in contact with the company , which was once again detected as fatal .
for most of us , there is an illness that can be ignored .
finally , asbestos is a product of the past .
since the 1960 &apos;&apos; s was no longer used in Britain since the 1960 &apos;&apos; s , as the industry voluntarily committed itself to using this .
there , too , where it has been used , only people in certain industries have worked directly with the substance , using the material .
today , as it seems to me , he does not seem to worry about this .
however , there is no way to do so .
the United Kingdom , it seems , is now experiencing the culmination of an ad hoc epidemic epidemic epidemic .
there are more deaths in this than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people are dying of this disease than in the case .
annual figures in terms of the company delivered in the UK for future deaths in the UK .
the reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now , although asbestos has been illegal for years -LRB- 1999 -RRB- it is true that there are only decades to develop .
and the scourge of the stick is not confined to former workers of the un@@ named chain .
asbestos has been and is often there , in the houses in which we are living , the offices in which we are working , the schools in which we learn and shopping .
this is why we can not afford to know , when it is said
there is no place for training in London , in London , in London .
there is also a number of companies that can help you get in touch with your needs .
in hospitals , in which we are supposed to be healthy , there have already been evidence of being able to find out .
Andrew &apos;s son was not old .
he has also not been able to make up for himself .
in fact , it was difficult to imagine where he might be in contact with asbestos .
then he took it out .
`` It looks as if there was a lot of asbestos in Guy &apos;s Hospital , where I was working for six years .
all - students , nurses , doctors , and the body who take part - using the tunnels .
you wonder what many people have had to suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , unfortunately , he was able to answer this question .
`` From the four doctors who were trained at Guy &apos;s Hospital , and in the last five years , he wrote in the last five years , &apos;&apos; he wrote in a letter , `` I am the last one who lives . &apos;&apos;
how many are we going to suffer ?
in the age of 48 he was diagnosed in the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 February this year , he was 100 .
this has been an unusually long run .
fifty per cent of all fully owned accounts are dying within 8 months after the diagnosis .
the disease is always fatal .
we can therefore only repeat the question of what we have to say .
the leading expert in Britain is taking advantage of the fact that , from 1870 to 2050 , if there is probably a risk of breaking in the UK , there will be an increase in the disease of the disease .
most of them have no idea at all that they will die .
there is a number of companies in Quebec , Canada .
a brief look at the files of the courts , which are often addressed by those affected , shows how far the scourge of the event is already widespread .
in June this year , for example , Marks &amp; Spencer gave us the opportunity to have to deal with asbestos .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for the two locations in two locations .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years later when she started her work at M &amp; S .
now she has had two children in the box .
`` Before this matter , &apos;&apos; she says , `` I have never heard of a lot of money , so I really did n&apos;t know about asbestos .
I would never have thought that this would affect me .
there are only a few people who know much about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos does not relate to a substance , but to a group of six minerals .
the name is derived from the word of the word in question , in a description of the material that makes the fabric capable and flexible .
three of the six were used in the same way .
as we know , there is now a great deal of asbestos in buildings , as is known as white asbestos .
it has been used for holding up .
it is less deadly than the other , but it is still seen by the EU and the WHO .
however , the most dangerous is the brown asbestos -LRB- exposure to -RRB- and the blue asbestos .
Britain has once been the largest importer of asbestos , asbestos , and experts suggest that there is clear and indirect evidence of this .
a staff of Marks &amp; Spencer was placed in Oxford Street , London , asbestos .
there may be no doubt that there is no place to be found in terms of tradition , but there is perhaps no doubt that the work in Julian suggests that their history is in no way unusual .
he has presented a study by those involved that says that `` an essential part of the can be found in the environment without known suspension by work or in the home . &apos;&apos;
most of these contacts are based on the `` normal use and aging &apos;&apos; of our buildings .
it looks as though none of them can be safe .
a report that examines the Palace of Westminster shows how people could always be exposed to the substance in the heart of the government .
in 2009 , it was reported that the company has been able to use asbestos with asbestos , in line with asbestos , with asbestos , which allowed the deadly fibres to be able to be found by something that is as high as `` strong . &apos;&apos;
Members of Parliament are often accused of dealing with their own interests , but this is where it looks like the opposite .
at the same time , the Board of Directors of the Committee on Budgets pointed out that there is now no doubt that 1 billion € in the amount of money has been raised over a number of years , in order to enable Parliament to make Parliament able to modernise and remove asbestos , in addition to the general elections in 2015 .
the report in question also indicated that the existence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions . &apos;&apos;
no one can know if this is going to cost life .
all we can do is wait .
a person who has never been able to determine the contact with asbestos is the subject of the subject of the name of Graham .
like Andrew , he claimed that he had been responsible for his work in hospitals during his work in hospitals .
`` I worked in a hospital , &apos;&apos; he says , &apos;&apos; he says , ` but I can not show in my course
it is so difficult to remember all places where people have worked .
what he is still saying is the day of early December 2009 in which he received a kind of fever .
he was 45 , and in short he had an operation in the evening .
suddenly , I had a lot of money .
it suddenly came .
I felt terrible .
I thought that the trip is no longer to be created .
as a doctor knew , he knew that the pain is due to the use of the body , the skin .
but he had no reason how he had no reason to suspect that there is no reason to guess .
he did not work for a month .
for example , doctors in charge took part in his chest and put an order in line with so many years of experience , in a way that can be found in the lab .
however , his complaints remained without diagnosis .
his health is slow and he returned to his job .
from time to time , however , the symptoms returned often , often after sporting activity and the call to do so .
in 2011 , a patient arrived in similar circumstances and was diagnosed in practice .
however , there is also no mention of this , however , in terms of the number of people who are now associated with this .
after all , his patient had been older and worked directly with asbestos .
the link in the case was clear .
in September 2011 , in September 2011 , there was a lot of time and he has been able to make his life easier and he was able to return to an expert group in September 2011 .
in December 2011 , exactly two years later , in December 2011 , a camera equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the body of the company and the amount of time .
I am an interim .
I continue to do so , &apos;&apos; he says .
to be honest , I did not worry about so many concerns .
but Rachel , my wife , was worried .
in the week between Christmas and New Year , they stood in the week between Christmas and New Year .
Googletag.cmd.push for example : diagnosis in the case of the situation in question .
suddenly , there had been a number of deadlines in terms of deadlines by means of holding nurses nurses , who advised him to take a lawyer .
only now did he understand the scale of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings , in which were often isolated with asbestos .
the people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering .
and so , in the case of many young people , there are now younger people who have not worked in the typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes in hospitals were found in hospitals , so patients have probably not been exposed to the substance .
however , many people who , in the form of a building , have taken part of a building into another -LRB- such as Andrew &apos;s son son -RRB- or in underground -LRB- as Graham did often did -RRB- , came with the greatest probability in contact with the toxic substances .
it is evident that over several decades after the war in hospitals for patients , they may have been able to carry out , but there are also a number of people who are responsible for the treatment .
it is still removed today .
there are many ways to get to know .
and it affects not only hospitals .
asbestos was often used in offices , shops , libraries and systems .
also schools .
in fact , many people have surely had the first round of communicating in the classroom .
everywhere in the country , in thousands of people in power , students have put their weight in charge in places that can be found .
on websites , the issue of asbestos is often mentioned in schools .
and meanwhile there are such innocent objects in our houses , as they had in the same way .
`` It is a real estate that is contained in large parts of our properties , &apos;&apos; says Andrew Morgan , the lawyer , in his trial against Guy &apos;s Hospital .
in one case , the only contact that fell to one of the affected women was the use of an act that can be used in the event .
so you will be able to fit in , as you do .
the effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is in cash is immense .
`` It takes a time to process , &apos;&apos; says Graham , i .
I went again to work and tried to continue , but I noticed that I was not able to focus on what I did .
I was in practice in two weeks .
then I knew that I had to do myself .
well , I am not going to see another thing .
with the greatest difficulty , there was a doctor in charge of the position of a doctor to the patient .
like countless patients , he reminds him how he was overwhelmed by all the information with which he had to come .
`` It was very difficult to take everything , &apos;&apos; he says .
`` I asked my doctor , `` How long did I have ? &apos;&apos;
and I had about 12 months .
I remember that I thought I thought I am not going to see .
that &apos;s what they did . &apos;&apos;
there is also a lot of money that can be found here , because it is often caused by the fact that it is caused by the deadly cancer .
most of the cases that occur are caused by the amount of money that can be found .
asbestos consists of the smallest fibres .
when asbestos is produced and the fibres are made available , they can set themselves up in the box , in the skin , by the skin .
there is also a lot of money that can be found here .
`` The problem is caused by the use of so many times it can be done , &apos;&apos; says Professor Tom Rother , a specialist in the company , which has changed to the Guy &apos;s Hospital .
it is precisely the hospital that claimed that he has exposed him to asbestos .
there were many others who were probably exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital .
as soon as there are so many times we can do so , it is always possible to get an eye on all of this .
from the beginning , nature is from the beginning .
the usual options for other cancer do not function so well in terms of similar circumstances .
the effectiveness of an operation is , for example , very controversial .
some believe that they are worthy of an attempt .
there is now something that unites all of them .
`` You can not cut part : he says it
they do not go around with the knife .
in the meantime , cancer does not speak very well , `` The impact is shown , &apos;&apos; but there is no need to use it .
`` There is sometimes something that can be , &apos;&apos; says the fact that there is a lot of money .
but at the end they die .
fortunately , some patients are actually living long , much longer than expected .
the author died 20 years after the diagnosis .
two and a half years after its own diagnosis , Graham continues to fight for a number of years .
after he was contacted , he came to contact with Andrew , in contact with Andrew , in contact with Andrew , for the four years after his diagnosis .
`` HI , is central , &apos;&apos; he turned out to be happy .
`` He was very positive , &apos;&apos; says .
he had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
in fact , there have been a lot of six months in the event of six months , as were the four months that last four months and were expected to extend only one month .
`` I was desperate , &apos;&apos; he says .
I wanted to give up .
however , there is still something that can be found in something that might seem to me .
after the advice of several doctors , there has been a need for the treatment of a number of patients .
`` We had an advantage of this that I had not to refer , I simply called and I got an appointment .
a normal patient would have to receive transfer and should wait for the authorisation of the treatment .
money is crucial for the best possible use of the best available therapies .
but if these treatments finally beat out , many people are affected by another financial concern - about the future of families that they leave .
and that is what the courts say in the hope of compensation .
he was born in New York .
`` It has been known since 1911 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health , says Morgan .
but what changed is that they have recognized that there was also a very low burden of holding out .
and here the negligence of companies began to play .
Andrew &apos;s Hospital , in turn , had placed his case , but it was not what Morgan calls `` full compensation . &apos;&apos;
after the investigation into his death , however , a speaker of the Guy &apos;s confirmed that `` The can be removed by means of .
that was too late for Andrew .
what can be removed
in fact , there is an enormous problem that seeks to compensate for compensation , with an enormous problem that divides the lethal case of a company or a workplace - usually over decades .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
they can be lost .
and those who are opposed to claims know that the time is for them , but certainly they do not like it .
as a response to this year , there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for people in charge to make it easier for people to pay compensation , even though their former employers are no longer able to find themselves .
the law has given a fund of EUR 350 million for all who were diagnosed after July 2012 and were able to prove a contact , but no one .
in such cases , there will be 80 % of what a court could say in an ordinary .
about 300 successful applications in the programme are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks that so many people believe that 350 million £ was a `` very good work &apos;&apos; in the event .
`` This is a deal of a deal for insurance insurance , &apos;&apos; he says .
I was also able to say that the law was not perfect .
however , like Morgan , both sides said that there is a need for rapid action in the face of seven .
`` The people are suffering so much and they need help today , &apos;&apos; he said in the second hearing in December of last year .
at that time , Graham was the first half in the hands in the hands in the hands of Prof. .
after his first discussions , the work that took place recommended an operation that , in contrast to Tom , expects positive effects .
this has been accompanied by a record of care and a sense of use - there is also an increase in the amount of time that can be found in the event .
there has been an increase in the amount of money that has taken place .
`` This is , of course , with the most important .
they always look again at patients .
there is something that can be done .
when you get a lot of money , you will be very slow .
in March 2012 , Graham withdrew in March 2012 .
at the end of August , he had the last hit of six .
there has been no evidence of the disease , in line with the fact that there is no evidence of the disease .
then I had a scan in March 2014 .
there have been a number of commonly used spots around my chest .
I have just been 50
this is not something that can be found .
this is something that can be found .
in addition , there was a lot of money that can be found .
there is now no trace of the flow of more than two times .
but the process is physical and mentally conscious .
they need to think of practical things - about money if I am no longer , for example , for example , as I would say .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they need to look ahead .
it is not always easy when the father was born in front of her father .
`` For parents , that is hard , &apos;&apos; says he .
it is hard to know what to say and how much is .
when I received my first diagnosis , I said to my girl that I had a disease with which I would not be old .
they reacted quite differently .
there is a lot of money that can be found here .
she told her friends and soon we got very many calls .
there was a lot of money that I had in mind .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that needs to make all of all available .
but there is no evidence of hope that such talks can be found in terms of hope , not by an eye of hope on survival .
the disease -LRB- as ultimately happens for Stephen Drake -RRB- is a matter for safety of safety .
as said by Andrew Morgan , he is not responsible for taking advantage , as Andrew Morgan says .
the body can be used to treat all of the body .
in addition , there is an increase in the amount of money that has been used to increase the number of seats and make it possible for a larger number to be used .
there is a need for asbestos , for example , in the case of asbestos .
there has been a fabric that is not safe .
I have had a lot of money that can be found in the measures that can be found in the event .
the use of modern commercial asbestos begins in Italy , where it is used to produce paper -LRB- also also known -RRB- .
important issues can be found in Canada and South Africa , in short in America , Italy and Russia .
it is the ideal place to get a lot of money .
global competition is rising over more than 30,000 tonnes per year .
in addition to this , there is also an increase in the number of people who work with asbestos .
there is also a lot of money that can be found here .
in addition to the fact that there is no doubt about the fact that there is no doubt , there is also an increase in the number of visitors .
that is the first case of this kind .
there are no liability for employers who are responsible for this purpose and do not assume any liability .
no compensation is paid for .
during the second World War , intensive ships are being built , one of the most commonly used projects in the field .
voluntary waiver of the industry on the import of asbestos in asbestos
there is also a lot of money that can be found in the UK .
global competition rises in excess of more than one million tonnes per year .
Britain imports 4.2 000 tonnes .
in the United Kingdom , all companies working with asbestos are obliged to make use of all companies working with asbestos .
imports and the use of ad hoc and secure asbestos of asbestos are prohibited in the UK .
any use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain .
in the UK , there will be an agreement in the UK .
350 million € will be announced .
asbestos is prohibited in more than 50 countries , but white asbestos is still used in many countries of the Earth as a matter of a similar type of material .
global production is around 2 million tonnes per year .
China is refusing Hong Kong in charge of taking advantage .
on Sunday , in spite of the increase in power , the Chinese Parliament decided in favour of democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 .
this approach is probably likely to be the case that protests in Hong Kong were announced in Hong Kong , while activists make the planning and mobilisation within a few hours after the show .
the decision taken by China , in principle , allows the communist leaders basically to show that there is no equivalent official candidate in power .
`` This is not unexpected , but it does make us angry , &apos;&apos; said .
that is not what Beijing promised .
you have the inhabitants of Hong Kong .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
in his defence of the Chinese decision , Li said to be able to say that , in response to the elections held by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly , there would be a call for the elections that would be available in the elections for the ad hoc government in the elections .
since 1997 , in 1997 , when Britain had control over Hong Kong , Beijing promised to choose the inhabitants of 2017 .
the Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough , because it gives public opinion to the citizens of Hong Kong , but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in charge of running through a close by Beijing .
after a new clause , only candidates are supposed to be admitted to Hong Kong .
the decision is followed by a summer in which some of the largest and most effective protests in Hong Kong have taken place for many years .
in terms of the democratic campaign in Hong Kong in Hong Kong , there is the motion for the movement of sound and peace in Hong Kong , as threatened by the organisers , who had threatened to make use of the ad hoc approach in Hong Kong when Beijing does not permit real universal suffrage .
in a couple of hours , within a couple of hours , within a couple of hours , hundreds of companies had gathered in the rain in the rain in Hong Kong .
at the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement has reached a new stage of civil service , which they have reached in the coming weeks .
however , they did not make any details , however , to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an informed statement , the organizers shared that the movement &apos;s movement was only taken into account for the occupation of the company , which has only been taken into account , a action that is only when they can be performed , which is only when they have been exhausted and is no other choice .
we are sorry to say that today , all of the accounts have been exhausted and will definitely take place .
the authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared to prepare for the announcement in recent days and , on Sunday , there was a need for enhanced security measures in Hong Kong .
the riots are reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
there is an increase in the flow of goods and services to the mainland .
in addition , there is growing fear that the values of Hong Kong , such as democracy and freedom of speech , are starting under the growing pressure of holding out .
some of them had the opportunity to take part in the demonstrations that took place in the event , as they were part of the work of Hong Kong .
`` The protests that they are talking about may cause great economic damage , depending on how many they are involved and about how long they last .
we do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong is out of control .
that is a bad thing for investment .
the government controlled media recently reported recently about China &apos;s lack of power in Hong Kong than by Western powers .
in this summer , activists organised an act of official referendum on the right at which they took part , more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
in July , tens of thousands of people participated in the history of the region .
there is now a tradition in the U.S. that is now transferred to universities , where there are so many times to be offered .
we are pleased to be able to respond to this demand .
in order to obtain a particularly impressive performance at the university , the company also offers the most important of the company .
Mr Stewart also said that the service has been able to make the service available .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who , otherwise , would have to make their arrangements .
we are looking forward to seeing you in this year .
there has been a lot of money that is still lacking , as the service has just been introduced , although it added that students will book the service in the coming weeks .
the company also said that , in spite of the fact , there is a market for this offer .
students now differ in their expectations and demands by the students prior to 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great initial impression , and there is precisely that with the number of students .
in the same way , however , there is still an increase in the amount of money that can be found .
`` This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students .
many students who begin to study this month are exposed to a crisis of too many years of experience , as the available subsidies in the form of credit and grants do not comply with the sharply rising accounts for the simplest way of taking advantage , before they can think at all about spending thousands of pounds for so little money as the arrival in the event
there is also a need for criticism in terms of the number of participants .
at the beginning of this month , in the beginning of this month , he was born in the beginning of this month .
participants withdrew their hands into the air , and in their hands , `` hands high , &apos;&apos; not shoot , `` while they waited in front of the show .
in addition to the fact that there is no evidence of this , there is also an increase in the amount of money that can be found in the event .
after years of experience , white parties claim that sex should be raised .
however , while tensions in the Middle East have risen and have received attention throughout the country , the fact that the answers to white women were 100 % of the race fell .
in comparison with the answers to the answers , black women , in short , came to the attention of 9 August .
however , there is an important change in terms of the number of companies that are taking place .
`` I do not believe that there are many people in feminism who speak about the white , say some people , who say they speak .
people were forced to express something about the incidents .
it is characteristic of the crisis in which we are located , because the situation in the case in question is so great as to say that they have to say .
in response to the situation that took place , there is also a lot of information that can be found in the areas of the city .
`` I can publish something about Facebook on Facebook over me and I publish my partners and get 150 out of power from anywhere , &apos;&apos; said Mitchell .
if I look at something about this , as I am saying , there is nothing about this , as I say .
`` How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship ? &apos;&apos; they did not ask for security ?
for black women like Mitchell , who studied race , gender and sexuality in the history of the United States , there is no such thing as being able to use any kind of action .
for them , black women have not had the luxury to separate the issues ; they live every day in the combined reality .
in the case of white women , there is now the question of race and gender in the so many ways in which they can be combined .
`` Between at least 10,000 black men , there were at least 10,000 black men , and the explanatory statement was almost always the rape of a white woman , &apos;&apos; said the subject of the subject .
white women had to be involved in history , in order to justify the fact that they will be able to use .
for example , the division between white and black women came to the point that in the early years of the 19th century , in the late years of the 19th century , the country , which in the late 19th century gave the country , the country , in the late years of the 19th century , led to the fact that the fight for the right to vote has only been successful for each one .
`` They met the decision to make a right to this and had to vote , and the right to vote for black should come later .
when you remember such things , one becomes aware of the fact that white women do not trust white women .
we did not make our job well .
we have never helped black women to protect their homes and sons .
even after women had received the right to vote in 1920 , there was still a decade in which white women were involved in the campaign against the use of space , in the Association of Southern Democracy .
the group created almost 40 years after the initial request for assistance from black women .
for Mitchell , the flood of white is the result of reactions to the questions raised - a mirror that has taken place - a mirror of time - a mirror of the time in which white im@@ itations played with the problems that black women have faced for generations .
`` It would not be great if the number of companies that have had the right to the education of a child is so serious as they are doing so with the right to use , &apos;&apos; asked .
in the second generation , the second generation , which built her career on the battle for the right to date and access to the ad hoc means of providing access to the number of money built to build up , trying to understand what that means .
the well known white line of the well-known white series was a two weeks after the call in question by Michael Brown on Facebook and he published an article entitled to an article about the name of the label in question .
`` I hope that women who have another , but there are other reasons why there is a risk of understanding one of the body .
in the same way , although there is a need for an association that is more likely to be found , there are some of them who speak in America .
we believe that young men in the United States , in particular young , say that young men in the United States , in particular , are so young as they were their sisters .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing .
but when the White House recently presented a small programme , My Brother &apos;s Nest , in order in order to help help help make young black and white men in charge dead , there has been a large number of un@@ attended reactions to many of them , in addition to the fact that there is a lot of money .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is pressing in the focus of the label .
after taking advantage of the fact that there are almost almost two thousand people in this year , minors have taken part in the country &apos;s exposure in this year , in addition to the fact that they are once again taking part in the surface .
in addition to this , Andrea said that he would be able to find out what he is doing .
`` These people speak for themselves , &apos;&apos; said the Committee on Agriculture .
if the vast majority of companies in charge are talking about male immigrants , the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories can be found in the interests of women &apos;s organisations , &apos;&apos; said it .
I am in store for sale .
the picture of a house owned for sale has been removed from the show that was found in the living room , making it clear that there was a great deal that had been made in the living room .
the house has a bedroom and is located in private street in front of me .
the details belonged to an image of the house house in the house - to the one that belonged to a sofa that had his head on a sofa .
there was a lot of money that had taken place on the photo .
`` The photo has been published and has been removed .
in the body of the house , in front of the house , the previous one described the previous one as one of the most unique with a bedroom . &apos;&apos;
although the broker removes the image from the website , it appears on advertising material .
in the social media , in the social media , there was an interest in the social media for interest , as some people asked if they were included in the purchase price .
there is also a lot of money that can be found here .
this month you will be able to take advantage of this month .
the search for an alternative in the southwest of Perth takes place , with a happy winner who receives almost $ 1.1 million from the show .
for the second time , for the second time in five years , in five years , the jackpot moved to the first division of the first division , after 1 million dollars in November 2009 .
however , the happy winner still needs to report .
he said that he had been able to get out .
the city is talking about nothing else , and all are fairly limited .
we thought that gain could happen .
over the past month , eight of the winners celebrated prizes in the first division , completing a record for a couple of happy weeks for players in the state .
in the past week , a player has been set up in August as one of five in August in August , after a couple of weeks that had reached only a few weeks previously for the start of 7.5 million dollars .
they had played for twenty years and said that they had the chance to travel and buy a new house .
in this year , the first division of the first division is the first division of the first division in this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .

genetic disorder often diagnosed
they say that they were the result of a series of two years over many years that they would die .
almost its whole youth lived in the belief that they have lived for only a few years after they had been diagnosed with another disease .
in fact , they had suffered by the fact that there is a number of so many people in the world , as well as all of them .
in addition to this , there is also an increase in the number of people who are aware of this disease .

there is also an increase in the amount of money that can be found , as is the fact that the disease is comparable to the time , which means that the symptoms will be worse .

when I received an answer , I was able to speak and I had to say that I was able to panic .
I thought that I would be with 18 in the wheelchair and die with 25 .
I made everything alone with me , making me get rid of what I say .
she said that when he became 17 , she was made clear that their skills did not get so much as they had imagined .

meeting professional business in the space of Washington is rising with economic recovery .
a recovery in the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
in the past year , state governments and local authorities rose slightly in the country last year , and economic recovery accelerated , as a newly published study in the last week , and companies in the area of Washington were no exception .
companies in the area of District , Quebec and Virginia jointly paid $ 6 billion in government and local authorities in the last year of 2013 , an increase of $ 6 billion compared to the revenue of 2012 .
the state and local tax burden of companies rose $ 71 billion over the past year , compared to $ 71 billion , and compared to 9 9 % in the year , it was the third round of the year .
state taxes rose more than local duties , with 3 percent , the study that was carried out by Ernst &amp; Young with the Centre for State Tax .
more than half of the trading revenue of the district , 56 percent , comes out of the same way , while 36 percent of revenue comes from companies .
Virginia achieved the lowest tax revenue from companies , with 28 percent .
most of the increase in tax revenue is justified in a recovery of companies , which say that researchers , which have increased by 3.7 percent in this year after the three consecutive years , led to growth rates of less than 1 % .
while a large part of these gains have come from large states such as California , New York and Texas , the course of the process also appears for the space of Washington .
companies in the district , Germany and Virginia , together with more than $ 10 billion , paid for more than $ 10 billion in government and local accounting last year , compared to $ 6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of a year .
but the apparent recovery in terms of competition is not so effective in the increase in public and local tax revenues , as there are now almost more than a fifth of companies in the field .
companies in Virginia and DC almost pay for half of their national and local taxes .
`` In the case of a large part of the property , in particular in the field of origin , is either in the possession of the government , or there are either owned organizations that do not pay for any part of any in charge , `` said Douglas . &apos;&apos;
there is therefore a need for a large number of companies , for example , in order to be able to use the same services to offer the same services that other countries offer .
the recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not be expected solely to the recovery of the market
there is also a need for recovery , which means that the data can be recovered .
companies in the region reported € 2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012 .
there were 1 billion dollars in record that controls the highest amount of the region .
while the trend is in the same direction , local companies do not grow evenly for businesses at all three locations .
there are 3 percent of the national average in the district , with 3 % of the national average , whereas the increase was significantly higher in Aceh , with 9 percent .
in addition to this , there is also a large number of companies in Germany .
with 6 percent in all three levels , Virginia has managed to control the significantly lowest level of the same -LRB- in all three , there are fixed places in existence -RRB- .
there are more than 75 percent in the number of companies , as well as the number of participants .
at the beginning of this year , a similar study by the Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that , in Virginia , lower state of state and state is being controlled .
in the study , the district was not investigated .
despite the advantages , Virginia stands under pressure from its southern neighbors .
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its exposure in this year . this is 9 % to 6 % , the same sentence as Virginia , as the sentence will fall to 5 % in the coming year .
if the state continues to reach its target group in the coming year , this law could reduce the use of the state of the state by 2017 by 3 % .
in the meantime , there seems to be a better way to go about Washington , and they therefore pay more public and local taxes .
the number of small businesses is controlled by small businessmen - one of the most small businesses in the world has been able to operate .
researchers say that the trend and the increase in exposure in the whole country are likely to continue in this year , with an increase in the overall , which took place in the first three years , in the first three days of 2014 , compared to the same period of the previous year .
nevertheless , the scope of Washington could be scarce if the Federal Government &apos;s economy has an impact on the labour market in the region .

it is precisely that YouTube is often referred to if you want to describe a lot of money , so the news that YouTube wanted to buy had come to buy something that has started .
it is a puzzle why the deal with YouTube did not come , as the company claimed they were willing to pay as much as Amazon .
all that we know at the moment is that this statement is in line with the so many things that we say : `` We have chosen for Amazon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get faster . &apos;&apos;
another secret is to say , frankly , the incredible success of doing business .
it is hard to understand the attraction that can be seen in the game .
it is one thing to look at a friend at 3 p.m. over the shoulder , while she is easy and quite different , something else that can be seen in a very different way , as he is shot in the head for 20 times .
you can now look at all these games .
another problem lies in the fact that many of the most popular games are now today , so there is now a good recipe for headaches .
I admit that there are a lot of fun that can be expected .
however , as long as there is nothing to be done , however , it is probably not as interesting as possible .
but what do you know when I know ?
it is called for by 55 million visitors per month and is the biggest source of running out of space .
and what exactly does Amazon want to make of money ?
it is hard to imagine that is so elegantly integrated in Amazon instant video , as YouTube could simply have taken away .
but there is something that every company would like to see : thousands of young men .
as the Chairman of the company , the Chairman of the company , said , he said , ` and the medium shows nothing about the future of gaming , &apos;&apos; and the medium does not show signs of an object that can be found .
there was a lot of work to go on on this occasion .
the concept of the organizer was accepted .
in spite of the strong public presence in the evening , there were an estimated of about 1200 points in the field , in spite of the fact that there is no point of departure .
at times , there had to be a stop to stop .
`` It was annoying , &apos;&apos; said Ron Rother , one of the organizers .
in addition to all of them , for example , in the heart of the city , in the heart of the city .
there are two Spanish words that have formed the name .
for the Open Air , in the same way , the Open Air is supposed to reveal light of light on the day and in the evening through various shows .
na , and fun anyway comes from home .
this was already evident in the early morning evening , as the first visitors to Open Air .
a feast for all generations had promised the organizers .
and they have succeeded in doing so .
there were a lot of money and at the same time there is a lot of fun that can be found .
they were followed by the first class performances , which were held in the day of the day , enjoying cool drinks and - in short .
and all over the generations .
while the one on blankets on the extra ground has white sand at the price , there is a lot of wine that can be found in a quarter of wine .
however , even at the same time , the volunteers had to do all they can , in the best sense of the word , in order to make him feel at home .
in addition , there is also a large number of companies in the field that can be found in many of the most important areas in the world .
until the great rain .
in short , shortly before 5.30 p.m. , he took care of the visitors , especially families .
but the attractiveness of the box did not break down .
`` There were more people who were expected , &apos;&apos; said Ron Hansen , who spoke of a `` success on the whole line .
that is why there is nothing against a repetition of the big party over the coming year .
although the content and size of the event needs to be worked out , made clear in an initial balance sheet on Sunday .
he said that , in the meantime , there had to be a stop to stop .
it is obvious that there have been too few forces in the company .
the consequence : some of them have already paid .
the response was very good .
in a first cautious estimate , he said that he was able to take advantage of the number of approximately 200 visitors who took part in the event .
there were problems with regard to the subject .
there is also a lot of money that can be found here .
the technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound .
it was not possible to establish the planned that had been planned , because the tents were not able to be restored for a period of time .
`` In the coming year , they will be in the event .
the premiere of the in charge was paid by the owners more than they have succeeded in .
and what about bad weather .
however , the organizers have committed a number of mistakes that will take place for the first time but have to be removed in the second edition .
in the social network of Facebook , too , the organizers have to be critical of criticism .
`` sorry , but for twelve euros you simply expected to expect more . &apos;&apos;
`` You have unfortunately taken a bit of money for you .
in other words , the initial problems are not so tight .
I think it is very good that some of them do not just be stupid but really try to put something on their feet .
in other words , this means that there is no reason why we will be able to use it .
now there is time to stop this criticism .
new in motion to make sure you can see .
that is not what is going on .
in fact , the package is ready to be used in the distinctive building .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the construction of the space , which is to be established , it is completely renewed .
the new will be something smaller than the old , with a diameter of 7.5 metres .
however , the size is still in place .
the last step to the completion of the new shell is the number one of the company .
the upper quarter of the old shell is separated and is taken with a needle .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell is set .
if the weather takes place , the action is to start at the beginning of this week .
in the event , in the event of the company , there is no doubt about the fact that it is still difficult to use the same .
in the past , he was able to use her to make sure that she was able to use her .
it is painful to say that this is painful .
a woman was delivered to the hospital after she had so much in charge .
as they were , they were so hard as they were doing so , as they had to do so .
`` The water has been so cold that I &apos;m running e , and while I really stayed , `` said them to The mirror .
there is also plenty of space to use .
there are a couple of seconds before the accident .
I wanted to close my mouth , but that did not come , and then I realized that something did not vote .
my mother and my sister also saw that and did so before laughter almost in the pants , but I had to put in the box .
it was supplied in the hospital in the UK to be delivered to the hospital , in order to let himself be able to return to the ground .
the clip has been linked to a box that is similar to Facebook and Twitter .
is there any way to get there ?
in short , there has always been a lot of time .
there is now an awareness about possible cooperation .
as an example of the reconstruction of the company in question , he led him to the company of the company , former Chairman of the company , in front of him , the project which took place in French .
even before a year , there was no good climate between the space in question .
it seemed to me that there were so many views that should be handled , as with the history of the company , which is to be found .
now the two camps are moving : talks should soon be held on a common approach .
they confirm that there is a lot of money that can be found , as well as the number of participants .
`` I have called for Mr Bradbourn and proposed that we could sit down .
in his opinion , all members of both clubs could return to one another in the future .

at the same time , however , it is now possible to get some information about this .

at present , the Association is one of the most important in the world .
`` After the death of my friend , Richard , we have been able to leave .
in other words , the new chairman is supposed to take part in the discussion .
until then , there is also something that can be found in our group .
there is currently no candidate for the presidency .
but I am confident that someone will find , &apos;&apos; as he does not want to stand because he has his home in Bad .
the new chairman should be an example of what they say they should be .
there is also a lot to do in the project .
the different points of view in terms of reconstruction will remain in the near future .
he always recognises the restoration of the castle , believing in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similarly advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea has failed to close .
they are also there for themselves by high participation by the public and by volunteers from all over the world .
let us be sceptical : `` I was sceptical about the beginning .
over time , however , I am more and more convinced that it is sensible to drive the project .
there is otherwise nothing .
in addition , the project would be part of the project , by means of contributions to the project .
`` The idea of reconstruction does not want to throw me over board , &apos;&apos; he hopes that there is perhaps something to be done on this point .
your goal of first reading history is important and well known .

Putin demands that Kiev should be opened for the inclusion of `` ad hoc ,
according to Russian President Vladimir Putin , on Sunday , on Sunday , the Ukrainian Government stated that the Ukrainian Government is taking the fighting against the calls to the East of the country and is immediately included in negotiations on the ` taking action in the region &apos; .
he said that Putin did not mean that he did not mean that the territory that is under control is a part of Russia in terms of control of the situation in question , but his status against Ukraine had to be re@@ defined , in order to give power for power to the region to give power to represent its rights and interests
however , Putin &apos;s call for negotiations in terms of negotiations in terms of an equal footing with the EU &apos;s s dominant .
in an interview , in an interview with the state television channel , Putin condemned Ukraine &apos;s to the Ukrainian ability to the line of the territories in the eastern regions .
in recent times , the Kremlin and the people in charge have recently referred to the fact that there is still an `` take advantage of &apos;&apos; approach to the situation of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those who , in the course of the campaigns , attack politicians in response to the elections on 26 , believe in the elections held in the territories that had been held in the event , and in the event that they may be killed in the areas that have occurred in places that have occurred in the event ,
`` We need to take detailed discussions , not just technical questions , but also for the political organisation of society and the place of law , in order to preserve the interests of people living there .
it said that Putin &apos;s reference was to be seen in context in context with greater autonomy , as they have been discussed since the months of the past months , when they have been discussed , which will be discussed by fears that threaten their cultural and linguistic rights .
only the Ukrainian Government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories in terms of the necessary autonomy .
it is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , said that it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but of an internal conflict in Ukraine .

Moscow would have far greater difficulty in making the regions that are better for the regions of Europe , as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants in Ukraine have had a large majority in favour of staying in Ukraine .
the autonomy raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine power of negotiating their own trade agreements and external relations , thus giving the Kremlin control over an area that connects the Russian territory with Crimea .

the Ukrainian President , in his speech on the issue , the Ukrainian President suggested that , on 7 June , Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should take account of the Constitution , with a view to considering the Constitution , with a view to providing greater control over its finances and the status of languages .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be contrary to those of the Kremlin and the ad hoc rebels , who are accused of being able to speak to Moscow .
Putin &apos;s last appeal to Kiev to negotiate with the measures that have taken place on an equal footing followed last week after Russian troops and tanks over the previously peaceful region along the road were the sea that took place in the box .
Russia &apos;s support , supported by Russia , took advantage of the first step of a campaign to take advantage of the first step of a campaign for the acquisition of strategic areas up to Crimea .
