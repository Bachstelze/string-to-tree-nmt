Obama Welcome to Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, it is also a question of resolving the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussion of a two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been looking forward for years.
Washington is critical of Israel's continued settlement of settlements and accusing Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The deal for Iran's nuclear program, advocated by Obama, has worsened the two's relationship.
In March, Netanyahu held a controversial speech at the Republican Congress's invitation to the US Congress, which was partly considered against Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting had not voted in favour of the time of choice in Israel.
In an emergency call professor to shoot his girlfriend shot to have his girlfriend shot.
In an emergency, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house.
It was important to point out that his swedish dog is still living and possibly excited, and he said that the relatives of the dead could be found on the mobile phone.
Inside the house, the officials found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was on a white block, so sorry, I could do it, I could go back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me, and he was signed by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no hint at the fact that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school site, where, according to the police, he shot a popular historical professor, Ethan Schmidt, who shot him and killed him on the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university staff have heard it heard at 10: 18.
He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call at some point in time.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police seized him.
One day after the shooting in the university, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to gain a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as that of students and collaborators who knew him, helped create a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.
Students have said that they are enjoying themselves on their own classes.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he spoke to the wonderful man himself, who shared his academic life.
Both educated in the social sciences and history department, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students visited courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies on problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon beavers, who praised the Lamb, said he seemed also a little excited and nervous, as if something was wrong with him.
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the Academic Year at the end of the Academic Year.
Previously, Delta State University asked for a permit for health reasons and said that it had any health problem.
In this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, for which the Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic path to job as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea.
These are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing from the campus, the police later found Lambs as he returned to Siberia from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb killed himself with a pen with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County, said Washington County Coroner methel Johnson.
His car ran still in the entrance.
ES was not immediately clear why lamb turned to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
It grew up in the area.
Starting in 2009, it began its work at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city with some 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He studied in pedagogy in the spring.
One of many years of Mrs Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through friends.
She and her friends were in the high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to bring her the guitar.
He was then at the time of the women's cold.
All girls melted away when he was there, said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Of course, and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency call said Lamb I have killed my wife, but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house bordering a Baye in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was in order.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but were friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old.
She was totally destroyed, she told Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
Steen said he never met Lamb, but his daughter Abigail told him that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
He met Prentiss, when he and Abigail appeared in a summer market three years ago.
Later they played together one or other of them.
Steen said, his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse working for several companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and entertain-coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night of 5 September, after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonicaspiel stop in front of a small audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
Just a happy couple, he said.
We were sitting down and rumbled together.
I think they had both a good sense of tears.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar and specialized in American native and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening, at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, some 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community participated in a candlelit memorial ceremony.
Schmidts's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Warlock, during the University's Halls of Bright Morning Star and Ren√© Amazing Grace run.
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
We try to move our students to a return, said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Finally, press authors Emily Wagster Pettus contributed to this report in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
This story has been corrected to reflect the fact that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that in his emergency call, Mr Prentiss, he referred to his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever been married.
Toys R Us plan to stop the Christmas season?

Michael J. Fox is talking about his story with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
We sat in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat beside me is empty, and it is becoming clear to me that princess Diana next to me will be sitting him, he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film back in Time's Eve.
The film begins, and it comes to me into the sense that I am a simulated girdle and an armesh away from being with the princess of Wales at a date.
Back to Time, an interview with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future, Back for the Future had its premiere 30 years ago.
I really like that, said Spielberg, there is no controversy about the biggest ever movie that has ever been shot.
Get back in time with VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief is saying that there is no military solution in Syria.
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia has increased military support for syries: There is no military solution to the almost five years of conflict, and more weapons will only aggravate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN leader calls once again all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite, and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France - at the margins of the General Meeting of the General Assembly this month, in order to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the breakdown in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers made this situation unsolvable.
She called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackling the crisis in Syria, which they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 polls that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as Flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a crash.
But no matter how some Republicans try to drag Donald Trump down from the top ranks of polls down, there is still work still not working.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys carried out Donald Trump in the double-digit range, and some begin to ask seriously what it means to the odds of the nomination of the real estate agent.
Of course, it is still too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Perrys's leadership came to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom gained a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a universal election.
But outsiders like Jeb Bush's Super PAC, and the conservative economy group Club for Growth, are now able to recognize greed and begin to channel their dollars to overthrow it.
Here are some current poll values that suggest that the real estate Mogul is not just a temporary phase:
High popularity rating has been rotated by 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey of Monmouth-University showed that only two of ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, there were 52 percent.
Now, six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Around three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week noted that 60% of the Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey carried out by CNN on CNN last week, 67% of the Republicans said that they would be either enthusiastic about or satisfied when Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be angry if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump for 43 percent to say they would be enthusiastic about 40 percent, who say the same about Trump say about Trump.
The next thing about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of republican voters say that they would be angry if Jeb Bush, the Favorite of the establishment, would be angry if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the candidate, would be angry.
A majority of Republicans do not see Bon temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52% of Irish voters believe that the real estate Mogul has the right temperament for a president, such as ABC News, Washington Post, on Monday.
The same figure applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the State of Iowa, where the same 52% of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent believe that he has not the personality to be effective his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, according to ABC Order Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
If they put their money heads down, Republican voters hold trump for real.
If they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a survey made by CNN on CNN from last week four out of ten that trump is the best bet.
That is a change since the time when four out of ten have put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination of only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
However, it is clear that a large number of GOP voters see Truotte's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to turrets, while anti-shock support is spread to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by Monmouth-University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support.
He has a lead in front of Carly Fiorina 13 points ahead, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally to border Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
ES is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to do it?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head race.
A large majority of Donald's fans say that they have formed their minds.
A new poll by CBS Collective NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump have decided to fix their votes.
Of course, much can be done to change this and no one really can say never to change the mind.
46 percent said they leave the door open in order to change to other candidates.
Nevertheless, sweepers are the most powerful competitor at the moment of the other outsider, the Neurochirurg Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as much in favor of Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they are in line with Trump on the subject of immigration.
Seitdem Donald Trump in his election campaign in Mexico two months ago called immigrants from Mexico called rapist called rapist called, was immigration a turning point in public discourse into 2016.
Some worry that the bombastic rhetoric of Trump will keep the Republican Party from the Republican Party and damage the new orientation efforts.
But, according to Monday's new ABC post-poll survey, six out of ten Republicans believe that they are in line with Trump on issues of immigration.
So, if immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will seem to do so too.
Frustration with the government is shifting to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for around half the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new ABC survey of ABC Post, they prefer a political outsider as someone with government experience.
They are also angry at Washington.
A survey by the Moines Register on Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowaans are frustrated by the Republicans" Republicans in the Congress, with 54 per cent of dissatisfaction and 21 percent in silence.
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany.
Here is the most expensive urbanization with views over the North Sea Stream.
In the street it costs a square metre of a noble house in a cut of 73,300 euros.
On Sylt, the offer of objects naturally has limited powers, that is, the study - that is, the high price.
A new study shows in which particular situations a square metre costs the most.
Of course, EUR 18.70 per square meter for a Studentenbude in Munich is not really small.
Unlike Germany's top homes, however, the price is one of peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & V√∂lkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices at a dilapidated height.
There are several tens of thousands of euros no - per square meter, please mind.
But well, anyone who can afford to afford can afford to do so.
Incidentally, Munich is not at the forefront here, for once.
Reggae League: Baydian dream start due to M√ºller and G√ñTZE.
Dual Torguard in Piraeus: Bayerischer Star Thomas M√ºller simply has a run.
A happy match of Thomas M√ºller gave the FC Bayern the opportunity to earn 3: 0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran out.
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season.
The world champion Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√ñTZE gave the FC Bayern a dream start in the mission of Milan.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won her tournament in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºller double pack of 52.27.
The twelfth start in series is to be the first step towards the final stage of the final on the 28th of May 2016 in Italy, where in the third attempt, in the third attempt, Guardiola wants to bring the torturer into Munich.
M√ºller received his 28 hits in the Champions League for the leadership of the team of Olympic champion Roberto, who was able to see a shot from the world champion.
As we are not going to underestimate it, Bavaria's captain, Philipp Lparalyzed, was promised in front of the Karaiskakis-stadium in front of 31 688 hottest fans - and the Munich held a word.
They showed a concentrated and dedicated vision without glittering.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class, including notable clubs such as Manchester United, Atl√©tico Madrid, and Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled into 1: 3.
But the Bavaria, in seven Europacup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but in their offensive efforts, they were often not creative.
The attacks have too often been launched against Douglas Costa, who was rarely beaten by the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
From right there was more luck than its flanks from the right half field on the left upper gate.
In the 67 minutes the world champion gave the possible 2: 0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, as Olympiakos-St√ºrmer Ideye Brown the head ball of Poland from the line beat up to 26.
Then by direct delivery, the goalkeeper Roberto with his knees parked 35.
Although the Bavarians enjoyed their usual dominant game, Piraeus could bury needle.
However, he was forced to do so on the goalkeeper Manuel New.
For example, when he shot a shot of Ideye over the bar steamed up 56.
Before New New, Guardiola was able to defend a quadruple with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who made it well.
Mario G√ñTZE, after his muscular problems in the Kader, sat initially outside.
The world championship hero has only been given the green light after the final training session, said manager Matthias Sammer on condition sky: Who wants to do something else, that is already malicious.
At the time of the first change, Guardiola fought against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for his vented Lewandowski in 59.
G√ñTZE arrived late for Arturo Vidal, 76.
Before the match, there was a tie in the stadium.
After a small group of partially married Bayern-fans in their spectator block seem to provoke the followers of the host Pirraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and went on shooting against the supporters of Munich.
At least one Bayern-Fan was injured from the stadium.
If you smoke, you have a higher risk of losing teeth.
If you smoke, it will damage not only the lung but also the teeth - that's close to a Potsdam long-term study.
Good news: If the risk is lost, the risk is quick.
Smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several members of the German Institute for Food Research in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smoking in smokers had the risk of losing their teeth prematurely, in order to increase the 2,5- and 3.6grams higher.
The scientists had watched more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes of teeth are caries and inflammation of the gum, which emphasizes the DIfE.
For these periodontitis smoking a risk factor, emphasize the authors.
The connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore based on more frequent gum effects on smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stop smoking may reduce their risks in a short period of time, write the researchers in the closed-loop Journal of Dental Research.
However, it may take more than ten years for the threat to be back to the level of non-smokers singe, explained Erdutor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
For people to be persuaded to be non-smoking, Heiner Boeing declared a subsidiary of the DIfE: Smoking reduces the lifetime of smoking.
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, results in a good dental health down to the high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 has been affected, divided the DIfE.
Earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study will substantiate the findings.
Archaeologists encounter traces of late antiquity from the Cologne Rhineland.
Once again, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard the archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic Church of Skeleton and remnants of historical buildings have been excavated, the architect Mark Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Historians have been searching for so-called land monuments since the beginning of the construction on the Rhine.
For all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always visited as a specialist for archeology.
In the third section of the Rhine Tower the archaeologists have now been found.
It was already known for text documents that at the point in the fourth century a fortress and in the 8 th century a church have been explained Trier.
In addition to Rests of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery was discovered with around 350 tombs, possibly belonging to the church.

European Commission is proposing in dispute about TTIP new courts in Brussels
To defuse the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are thus to be replaced by a more transparent system that is more traditional in the way it operates.
We want to set up a system that the citizens trust, declared the EU Commissioner for Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr√∂m at the presentation.
The Swedish is proposing to bring forward the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free-trade talks with the United States.
The German Government announced support.
TTIP is intended to bring about the world's largest free trade area with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures specifically stipulate that the EU Member States and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new capital court.
They should come to the same parts from the EU, the United States and third countries.
The first time there is a second instance, for the first time.
It would allow you to protest against judgments.
So far, the participants agreed on referrals, but there was no objection to their judgments.
In the debate over the past few months, it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, commented Malmstr√∂m.
In the long term, it wants to work for an international investment court in its own right.
It could then, for example, resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU Member States.
Above all, it is considered to be one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration board is criticized by opponents as a form of parallel justice, through the loss of compensation at the expense of taxpayers to compensation for taxpayers, or to enforce consumer and environmental standards, or to reduce consumer and environmental standards.
In the first statements, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact are inadequate as far as the Commission's proposals are concerned.
In particular, it was criticized in particular that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada's CETA.
The German economist Matthias Machnig's SPD, however, called the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission has taken into consideration essential points in the reform, which have been drawn up by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration is from the table.
The French Government, too, welcomed the plans of Malmstr√∂m.
The European Business Unit (BusinessEurope) warned against restricting the business opportunities of the economy through too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged as a result.
When talks about the TTIP brand new Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement can be concluded, on Wednesday, it remains unclear.
The negotiations have been going on since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not, until now, been discussed with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should already have been reached at the end of this year.
This date is considered to be no longer tenable.
Violinist Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg.
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sat on stage at the Cologne Prime Club today: Luxor.
In addition to him there is a flipchart on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with filmpin.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens' presentation.
He tells of different places he keeps on the map on his map, talk about his minute-style songs and zart arranged songs.
Where they were born and as it looks there, in his homeland.
Since then Stevens have proved to be a wonderfully creative Irish.
With the release of "The Great Lake State" in 2003, the Great Lake State is composed of songs that can be harmonious very close to the American folk of the late 1960s, but can at all times be able to turn into great opulent tongues.
There is a rumour that Michigan would be the first part of an abandoned series: Each of the 50 US states would be affected.
However, as early as 2004 and in Rheinnear, Seven Swans appeared to be released and breaks positive expectations.
In this way Stevens are joining here.
Live enough to live in guitar and banjo.
One year later, the musicians living in New York will return to the series.
At the time of the release of the album, the album was released on the first album of the 20th century.
Overcrowding on ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album is rising to the American Billboard charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media.
After a very productive experiment, Stevens is using the Age of the Age of Adz in 2010.
This sixth sound studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried out by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and performance.
As far as the smaller clubs grew out, the stage shows here will be the colourful spectacle from Neon headbands and large fluorescent studs.
At the same time, Sufjan Stevens tour as part of a five-headed band from Germany.
In the darkness of Hamburg more!
He is also present at the press conference in Milan, Germany. He is also presenting his films for the first time.
Although there are now nearly 2000 guests in their chairs, the much more excited Stevens returns to intimacy and to the folk.
Without giving a word to the audience, the group of outstanding musicians is playing through the richly enriched album.
Listen to the audience: The talk is more opulent, so you can throw off the disk in the real way.
At the time of the album, the album was released on the first album of the 20th century.
Jeremy Corbyns's debut in Question Time for the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyns's debut in Question Time for the Prime Minister was eagerly awaited.
The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will be making his debut in Question Time for the prime minister and for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise to address the first of his six questions shortly after noon, in which his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour Labour Members from nearby.
He called for fewer theatres and more facts at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Corbyns' s leadership, for it comes after his nomination as a member of the Shadowcabinett and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Chairman, on Tuesday during the defeat of the national anthem in a commemorative celebration of the 75 anniversary of the Battle of Britain, provoked criticism from a number of Tory-MPs and is at the center of several title stories in the newspapers.
Corbynn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had stood in a respectful silence in a respectful way, and he recognized the wartime heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle against England.
But a member of Mr Corbyns Shadowcabinett, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program, he told Labour Chairman to sing the national anthem, independently of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns's top team, thereby relying on differences in the economy, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also broken up within Labour, according to Mr Corbett's remarks about the position of the European Union and the limit.
As Corbyn said the TUC conference that Labour changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limit as a whole.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow Labour Minister, said that the Party is very clear that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26.000 GBP to 23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Leader, David Cameron, Seitdem he Tory-boss, in the last decade over the Dispatch-Box in Parliament.
The Labour Leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is confrontational, and that he is not going to be able to do so, and that he fails to act with his opponents and that he has done nothing to focus on serious problems, such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economics minister, will be represented if he does not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also initiated the idea that other Members may speak occasionally, and that he addressed John Bersom, the Speaker of the House, to discuss the problem.
When he was leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to distance himself from politics in the style of a purported pamphlet that is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he acknowledged that he failed to do so.
Since they were first broadcast in 1990 on television, Question Time with the Prime Minister was considered to be the most important barometer of a leader's ruling and his position among his fellow Members, despite the fact that critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs major reforms.
Life shoots in Joburg': The homeless young people are trained to photographers.
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place for homeless people.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn skill and to earn a living.
I was born in Joburg, I was born in Joburg, I was born in Joburg, he was a non-profit working studio, a non-profit working studio that teaches the homeless young people how they can take photos of their surroundings and gain a profit from it.

Pound rises by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound soared by data that increase the UK's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 has been increased by the SABMiller company.
Between May and July, the result, with no bonuses in the United Kingdom, grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage has been the quickest and informed estimate since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound increased by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505, and stood up to 0.84% against the euro to ‚Ç¨1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the most prominent share on the market and made a rise of 20% after the acquisition of the rival AB Inuss.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and combine brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry-shares were after encouraging news from the competitor of Richemont 0.9%.
Richemont's latest sales figures all beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting back to growth.
Shares from Glencore climbed by 5% after the Bergbauriese said that he took $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of his strategy of reducing debt.
The shares in Mondi's packaging and paper group were the biggest losers in the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs put their assessment on the company rating on selling.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports betting company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the six months.
The boss of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion.
The CEO of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.
But it is unlikely that those purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs at its business, says.
The costs could be about the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin.
Justin Bieber, megastar.
For 21 years old, a hanging object with an upper fold.
The type with the platinblonhair is EUR 100 million hard.
More likely, more.
At the moment, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 turns through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name of the name "Ritz Carlton" ever.
Not worse.
Hundreds of fans accompanied by Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since at 7 o'clock in the morning, the upholstery on the cold stone plates precede Berlin luxury hotel at the Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live your idol whose poster hangs up in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, will cost exactly as much as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If anything.
The saying: In fact, it would have to be my Viktoria in the tenth class in the secondary school.
This is where I meet her dream of life.
Duty of duty?
What do they do?
The fans do not.
Even bending them yourself is not possible.
That has, in any case, been borrowed.
For the promotion in the promotional break of the Superbull, he turned three million, a two-year deal with an anti-picker company, many, many dollars were pumped up.
And at every doll that looks like him and over the Ladnecsch, Bieber also comes.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you are amazed at the window pane.
More than 100 million have to be exploited in this way.
Manche say that the hype is going too far.
Others emphasize that bending is just in the US and the United Kingdom, with its new single "What do you do you," in place 1.
Even if the fourth album is expected to follow in November, the many zeros won't interest.
At least that is what it is doing.
Pegida's poster brings Lebanon to potato d√∂ner's idea
Potatoes or D√∂ner?
ES is designed for both - in the potato d√∂ner, which the Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying goodbye to potatoes, instead of d√∂ner on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay potatoes and meat were put together on a tabloid.
On the idea, he brought him a poster on a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "eat potatoes," instead of D√∂ner he had seen on the television on a random occasion.
Seitden turns in his shop a barbeque that is equipped with meat and potatoes.
This is called Multikulti for the stomach, says Alhay.
The idea has now been given by the Lebanese to the Patent Office in Munich.
There, it has recently been protected as a model for use by the Authority.
As much meat and how much potatoes is contained in the tables, Alhay does not want to betray it.
Just so much: It tastes better together but better still, it finds it.
The culinary international understanding is also a good thing for his clients.
Metcash is launching a foundation for the fight against Aldi-
Metcash tries to protect the IGA stores from an Aldi-show in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesalers Metcash has started a campaign campaign to defend the market share of IGA-retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million African invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and ANA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media, as well as events such as Adelai show.
IGA-dealers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Eishmaker Simmo from Dunsborough, who are distributing in IGA-Lware samples and stores owners selling approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to our loyal customers.
ES is expected that Metcash will publish further details of his defence strategy on 29 September, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment carries his annual investor strategy day.
There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcashs IGA's shops and generate more profit margins than Metcash's network in the eastern states.
EInkpurchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA-retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi, 12 months after its first markets, opens up roughly five percent of the food market in these two countries, removing all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA-retailers could lose 360 $million sales per year and metcash $250 million to the end of 2016.
This prognosis is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and food business, and in quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost base, Metcash could cost about $13 million in interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash's turnover in food and food business is 3.8% in 2016, a 4.1% in 2017, and 2.1% in 2018, and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the leader of the Magellan Financial Group, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told him that Metcash would disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments made by Mr Douglass.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash with Mr Douglass contacted him last week.
IGAS has declined from 18 percent to 14% since 2010, and revenues from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, which reflects the operational burden of debt, while at the same time reflecting pressures on sales and margins.
The wholesaler, however, and invests more than $150 million to harmonise sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week, and to improve their stores with faster growing fresh food to improve their shops, and to deliver a better choice of private-based food.
Metcash's chief executive, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and shopkeepers will be renewed and hopes that, for the first time in four years, large traders will return to a profit growth in four years' time.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Federation Steve Healy.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the collateral collateral damage caused by the recent storm around his friend Nick Khagios, and in the opinion of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy deserves rather praise as a critique of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented Duos, which is repeatedly referred to as a special version of Special Ks, was put in the spotlight by the infamous controversy of Cygios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after that, Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, had to be separated twice by the referee, with Mr Harrison, saying that he would have to defeat Khan, and I should beat the child.
While at the last time he was seen as a tennis racquet collapsed after a Krampf held a potential U.S. Open-Sieg by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth with the second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davic in Davis-Cup-Semfinal against the United Kingdom.
One thing about which I am rather more experienced is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi said a bit in the dispute, he said Healy.
He broke down a racquet than he lost for a crab in the US Open, but he is not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi good enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even in the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much credit.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family round around, and I believe he has been treated a little too hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the changing area, he training hard, he is very well in shape, he is a very stable and mature boy, and I believe he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy did not support the decision to ignore Cygios in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday, and he describes the common decision as the right one for all, but he guarantees the man from Canberra as a permanent member of the team to return to the team.
First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on competition and not on all the controversies surrounding all the forces of the Qur'an," Healy said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has managed to get out very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray pointed out, and he has made some bad mistakes and has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets, and he deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we try to support him, but we try to make him support him, but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions, but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions, and he is the best for the team, and it is best for him to do so, and it is best for the team and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, concludes the border, keeps refugees back.
Hungary declares the state of emergency and urged the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border, when hundreds of migrants joined in a no-man's land, and Serbian officials responded with outrage.
The people who had fled against violence were trapped for an unknown time in a land strip at the road between the two stations of the countries and built tents and settled down there.
But Frustrations grew.
As a police helicopter was flying over them, migrants opened up the border!
Some meadows from protest foods and water back.
Serbia's foreign minister declared that it is unacceptable that migrants are sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
For Serbia, Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not a collateral damage.
ES must be held in the coming days with Brussels and other countries, said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Serbian Serb border did not arrive at a common immigration policy after the 28-national block at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40.000 people who, in excess of one month or until the end of the year, gave their hope that an agreement would be reached for the EU Member States to include more than 120,000 refugees, including some of them from Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not have its hopes for an early action from Brussels or from its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions responded to authorities on Tuesday, giving authorities more powers to manage the crisis so they could block roads and speeded up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister, Mr Peter Szijjarto, in the meantime said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country, having finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Member Agata reported that even prison guards were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and an entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted, however, that most of the future economic migrants are in search of a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in conflict with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary, crossing the border or the humiliating of the 4-metre high fence imposed by the government along the southern border with Serbia, are also a crime.
To explain the situation that was created by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declared the state of emergency, said government spokespersons, Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to agree to the military operation, which is expected to be used by the military, which is expected next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen, at the border, heavily armed soldiers with cars and hires for days already.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Land-security adviser for Orban, said that authorities have lured 45 people to try to cross the border, while 15 others have gone deeper into the country.
They come down by corrupt the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes in accordance with the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a train wagon with barbed wire to close the borders.
Chaos changed the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to deal with people's data and pressed a crowd to get into it.
Some 20 have managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link from Serbia and Hungary, saying that they would deny food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016: Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Bernie Sanders in national survey, halved.
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her against the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47% of the democratic voters in the polls, 58 percent previously, while Sanders is second, with 27% growth by 17 percent.
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet declared that he is running for the presidency, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the preselect.
More than five months before the start of the preliminary elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is defined, which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more resistant to choice than that of the other candidate.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a number of profits.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but these jumps have been reduced.
Your support among men has decreased significantly, and Sanders back here from only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage over democratic voters in less than 50 years has been displaced, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
However, Clinton still has a big lead in the older voters.
In the past month, Clinton was in front of the Liberals in the second place, but Sanders now have a five-point lead with this group.
Roughly half of the democratic voters in the pre-elections across the country say that they would support enthusiastically Clinton if they were nominated by the Party.
A quarter would support them with some of them and only support another 15% because they are the candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
Not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about them.
The views are more mixed among those who do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48% of the democratic voters in the polls say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this over their top candidate Donald Trump, 35%.
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate, the most common answer is that they have the right experience of having the right experience, followed by the view that it's time is that a woman President will be 13 percent and that she is the best candidate for the job is 10 percent.
From Clinton's supporters, their ties with Bill Clinton are also mentioned above 9 percent.
Agreeing to deal with problems and the diableness are also cited.
As the Vice-President throws up a presidency's potential for the presidency, 57% of the democratic voters want him to see him in the race - although a third believes he is not supposed to do it.
If democratic voters are asked to elect who is the second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
From Clinton's supporters, more than half, Biden would have their second choice far off Sanders.
If Biden is not to stand for the nomination of the democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead is increased in front of Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win, but this figure has fallen by 78% last month.
Biden is at the cutting edge of this measurement, but the percentage that it considers to be the most qualified is increased.
Nevertheless, on the question of what is more important in a candidate, the name of democratic voters raises questions about the right to choose.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or a potential candidate has been found to be unacceptable to those voters of the preelections.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results on a number of important features among voters in their party's preliminary choices.
Majorities views Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is the best in the minds of the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say over Sanders 15 percent, but 27% have no opinion on him.
Democratic voters in the first elections generally view Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
For all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server will continue to be given as Secretary of State during his tenure as Secretary of State, most democratic voters in the polls are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their views as a whole.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with their statement today, whereas only about a third is satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on Clinton's overall opinions, despite the fact that 36 percent said their opinion has deteriorated.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this is still a problem for her in general terms: Only 32% see it as honest and trustworthy, eight per cent fewer than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62% of the voters do not regard it as an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of eligible countries also see Trump as dishonest and not trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good marks at leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are the best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders more than honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The rate of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson at a nationwide poll close to Donald Trump on the way
Ben Carson is at the latest survey of CBS News The New York Times closely behind Donald Trump.
The two candidates now account for half the support of the voters in the new poll, and others are dramatically reduced.
Republican voters will continue to support Trump in large numbers, supported by 23% in the latest CBS survey carried out by Fox News last month, 27% in the poll of Tuesday.
But Carson Schoss in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also revealed that Carson is good for demographic groups, exceeding Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the Governor John Kasich, has been shut down with Wisconames governor Scott Walker, who has fallen most, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida-Senator Marco Rubio, is in third place at 6%.
The error marge in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6% and was done in September.
The latest CNN news ORC poll published last week shows that Carson is in surveys - he lands at 19% support to Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The most recent survey of ABC News from Washington Post also showed Trump in front of Carson.
With a glance at a Carson last week, Trump found some side patches for the former neuroidal surgeons, even after Carson apologized for faith in trust.
We need energy, Trump said last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The Eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees at the moment.
Even if peak values are only measured in a distance, a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing tourists will be enough to find still warm water.
A bath in the North Sea or the Baltic is likely to be a maximum of 17 degrees at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Mancher is no longer talking to the sea: A maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the Northern and Baltic Sea this week, shares the German Weather Service of DWD.
Bathing temperatures, however, continue to offer the Mediterranean: It can even reach up to 29 degrees in the east.
In the Adriatic, there are 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood were charged with the death of a Bartel College-newcomer.
Nearly two years after a student died in a bullying ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, there were attacks against five people.
In September 2013, members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta Brotherhood attacked and delayed their transport to the hospital in September 2013, and delayed their transport to the hospital, resulting in his death, in the hands of the police.
Officials said he was burdened with a 30-pound bag full of sand with a long eye, and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field on a target.
Mr Deng eventually complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Brotherhood did not call the helpline number 911 after Deng squandered and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, so the police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothing, their symptoms to goocks and Andy Meng, to contact the national President of the Brotherhood, to obtain advice to the Council, he said Polimarked Chris Wagner told him at a press conference.
On that point, the members began to hide Utensilien and put the benefit of the Brotherhood in principle on that of Michael Deng, he said Polimarked Wagner.
He could not be resurrected, and he died on the next morning of his injuries.
In the aftermath of an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted on injury to his head, the hull and the thighs.
Many families have been destroyed by the anger of the Brotherhood; at least one student, Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents the Dengs family, has been killed in a statement every year since 1970.
Fractions and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury by Monroe recommended a charge for murder third grades for the first five members.
Thirty-three members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassment and creation of a criminal association.
We do not want to blame only the persons involved, but if there is an organisation that has been sanctioned or not officially sanctioned, so we shall also call it to account, Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has withdrawn their affiliation with the local group.
That will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest rates, and the house is going to falter, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long this will take and how long it will be.
In particular, history provides a little bit of guidance for the economy.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial systems react.
Therefore, representatives from the US Central Bank have been so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates but rather on the period required for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end of the day, market participants, however, could see that the whole commotion caused more than a rate hike might be exaggerated.
First-ever increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis has inevitably been interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money read, said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at a low level to lead to seismic shocks that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend based on how to respond to some sectors of the economy:
As the market has seen last month, raising interest rates can make things more volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
There seems to be a tendency that recoveries 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy, said German bank analysts in a recent study of what happened to the Fed's rate hikes.
To be more precise, over the past 35 years, over the past 35 years, the market has been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the path to rise to interest, rather flat in the 250 days after the average profit of 2.6 percent, then returned to the normal rate after 500 days, then returned to the normal level after 500 days, with an average yield in the last six months of 14.4 percent, according to a current analysis, which was published by Bob doll, Chief Investment Manager at Nuveen Asset Management, in Barron, in the last six months.
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the increment cycle, and the return is beginning to reduce.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often encourage interest-rate hikes.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with a number of conditions that could not have existed before, and which could accelerate a recession.
Remarkably remarkable is that gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in the Fed's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 rate hikes since 1950 were only twice nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter in 2015 was 3.6%, few expect that this will continue and for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed, only 1.5%.
Interest-rate increases at such a fragile economic scene may be risky and raise the question of whether this time is different, said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have been caught in the Fed's interest rate throughout the year, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading is only 25 percent.
In our study, all the rates of increase in 1950 to date have been held in a super-cycle with an increase in GDP and foreclosures in the shadows very quickly after the start of the recovery, such as the report.
By contrast, this is a clear slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, and this has been 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipated a rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, returns seem to change direction when the first increase is made in the cycle.
At the end of the increment cycle, bond yields immediately fell, said Deutsche Bank.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to converge, and turn the curve down.
High-yield bonds often produce better returns in such a climate, although we are still wary of expecting more output," said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst in Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that markets have already adjusted to Fed's strategic expectations.
In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy, and has written to them.
Short term interest rates have gone up, the maturation curve is flat, and volatility has increased, and volatility has increased - all of the market's characteristics, when the Fed tightens up its strategy.
Large and large, businesses that handle the majority of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational firms with high debts will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, and likewise the financing of their debts.
History shows that holding quality shares tends to respond very positively, three months after an initial rate hike in a very positive way, in a report by Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for the customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with weak balance sheet after each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004, in average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital ratios, as well as low volatility in their shares, also transferred their counterparts with low quality, average 4 percent percentage points, and 3 asset percentage points.
Debt is a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will be the most likely to lose," said Goldman.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the station because of its dual nature.
He argues that he is increasingly unaware of commercial rivals.
He also directed the BBC Music Awards and said that she only imitated The Brits.
Mr Damien Collins addressed the message The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 is transforming itself into Classic FM, says a senior member of parliament, and increases new pressure on the station, to prove that he does something that the private sender does not do.
The Conservative Member, Andrew Bingham, also said to the BBC bosses that the state official radio broadcasting station is being misrepresented and increasingly no longer to be heard from its commercial competitors.
It seems to me that Radio 3 - I don't like to use the word to talk about anything else - but it seems to become a Classic FM, he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards that were launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards that began last year seem to be that The Brits appear to be on a different name.
So if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you are actually imitating what is already on the market, Mr Bingham said.
BBC-Director-General dismissed the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I learn about Radio 3 is that I won't learn anything about classical music anywhere else.
There is also a commitment to live music and music that is truly outstanding.
As well as the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and work on new works, I really think it is important, he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, argued that tougher work should be done to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British were less informed about classical music.
However, radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production, which was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport under fire to put commercial rivals on their feet.
The Torah MEP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of ¬£22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marked?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 Show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced on special BBC ways.
He added that he wants the company to get a hit from our own stall when it's next time a series of entertainment starts.
However, he refused to exclude the order of other ranks from The Voice in the future or to pay bills for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased in August at the slowest and black Friday can be responsible for it.
In the first three months of 2015, there were seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest score since the records began in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has held back the expenditure.
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been driven out, and many of Britain's main shopping streets turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there is now evidence that online sales stagnate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the year 2000, with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
If you are looking for growth rates for years and down to 2000, then it has always been developing over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index in the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago, when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
ES meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, like home on the sofa.
But that is now commending, and we may see that growth is diminishing.
The Black-FriDay phenomenon, which was imported from America, is quoted as a reason for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that buyers will withhold their purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, Scharte had five times the average number of buyers to turn their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that black Friday, in which the buyers fight for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of 5 ¬£expenditures has been spent a little more than 1 ¬£online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the city centres.
Muslims buried in the Brenner accident in Mecca - Bin Laden's family are being sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried out by Muslims at the first funeral in Mecca through the streets.
Saudi Arabia is putting down the collapse in part of the vast Saudic Bin-Laden-Group on the burden
The Ministry of Health has said that, moreover, a total of 394 people have been injured after the crat.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed than a crane crashed on Mekkas Gro√ümoschee.
Dreams filled, largely dressed in white, the track to honor their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al Qaeda's graveyard.
The funeral procession took place on the Holy See, where only days had previously crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the fallen.
The bodies were freed for the funeral, when the Saudi King imposed a sanction on the construction of Bin Laden for the disaster, which also suffered 394 injuries.
The bodies of 29 Beters, who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great central moschee of Mekka, were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage to the Kran.
Mr Akram was involved with his parents before the start of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already agreed that the Haddsch to Mecca will continue with thousands of people who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Lada group should not have allowed the crane's arm to stop when it was not used.
An Arab version of the Decrets that was published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin-Lady Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service reported this detail not, but said that the management of the company was forbidden.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what was causing the toppling of the crane to fall into an inner yard of the Great Moschee, in which hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Haddsch, which takes place later this month.
The Bin-Lady Group has not issued any statement on the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree, however, did not include the group for not taking current security measures, and because they did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mekkas Gro√ümoschee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades, and is accepting larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990's.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials out of ¬£174,000 were paid to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount to permanently injured.
Others have received half of this amount.
B & Q Boss tells that the time of the cheap East European craftsmen is over.
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has been rising behind them?
The result is that 200 more Screwfix stores that aim at craftsmen will be opened up.
At the same time, Kingfisher will import 60 B & Q sales outlets nationwide.
From Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail.
ES is maintained that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East workers who carry out their work in their homes.
If you are sent with a hammer or a brush to remove walls, you seem to be a minority now.
Because Britons increasingly employ craftsmen to carry home care jobs in their houses, such as the boss of the company behind B & Q.
V√©ronique Laury, new Managing Director of Kingfisher, who owns the cotton chain, said that a big increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices has been superseded by now.
For this reason, Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix stores that meet up to professionals and 60 outlets of B & Q.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to spend more women in B & C shops, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions are made in the shop of women.
At the moment the men are standing in the way of men.
She said that it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that are more female single-households than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men in our stores.
We need to shift this more to balance.
Basically, half of our customers come from women with 80 percent of decisions about buying articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women to the top of a British in the FTSE100 Index, has also set up her top team to reflect on equal numbers of men and women in managerial positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including his management and financial director.
Mrs Laury said: 'This was a deliberate decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year earnings and sales after the group owed the costs to closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, der Screwfix and B & Q owns 200 new branches.
Officers of Aich DOB for Unfaithful to Court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, two officials from the Austrian volleyball champion Aich DOB have been responsible for infidelity and relocation.
Those who have been accused are not guilty.
One of them was also accused of wrongdoing.
From this charge, he was legally acquitted in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to the Supreme Prosecutor, Robert Riffel, the investigation revealed that the defenses used for private purposes in 2006 to 2011 were used for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial offences.
This fact left the chair of the Schopenensenats, judge Michaela Sanin.
ES shall be negotiated at a later stage.
When the infidelity came to an end, the defence was that the association did not come into being at any time.
The sports officials would have paid only allowances and the sports club, for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011, and in which they had invested a great deal of time and money, from debt - the Passiva was about 600,000 schillings worth about $44,000 in 2001.
At that time we were confronted with the situation: Let us keep the club up or block it, told one of the defendants, in the bread profession of the financial authority of the Finance Office.
He decided to take on this task with his colleague and fellow member.
With all the risks.
We have put money on money, our life assurance as a security at the bank, he said at picking.
With the association has been agreed: You can manage the money freely, there must be no debt.
In addition, in financial terms, the payment of the compensation allowance has been adopted retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, only years later, starting from 2003, as a plus in the account, a portion of the allowances have been paid out.
Therefore tracks also include package - and not detailed booking, explained the former Obmann the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
Why the payouts were not open to the club, the judge asked.
The association has not been interested in detail for financial management that only the debt was important, so the answer.
A sum of 120.000 Euros was transferred to the club's account in 2011.
Those were resignations, declared the accused.
This securities account ran on the name of the second accused and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
Why did you want to know the judge?
There was no answer to that for a long time.
Then he thought he believed that this was the best for the association.
If nothing had happened to him, no one would have known this money that the public prosecutor was in the room.
The co-accused would have been informed, justified on the right note.
This bank transfer was formulated as a damage recovery statement.
Why a damage done, a judge or a public prosecutor, wanted to know it.
The first defendant declared that he did not agree with this formulation, because no damage was done to the Association.
But what should I do if the lawyer says: With whom ye are all out of the tailgate.
If I had a legal representative, I asked him.
In addition, the official, he never paid a cent salary, he paid only mileage and rates.
He gave the club $1,000 per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Exact documents for the early years could not be shown for the accused.
They were not kept anymore after an operation check in which everything was judged correctly, they declared them.
The second defendant was also credited for exchange money.
All arrangements can be made in cash, so he has to drive from his place of residence from his place of residence to the bank to Bleiburg, he declared in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard eliminated more than 30 000 jobs
In addition to working for three years, the computer giant is going to cut off further jobs during the division of the company.
There is no end to the assignments on the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard's HP system.
As part of its restructuring, the US Technology Group plans to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate client.
In order to save ‚Ç¨2.4 billion at ‚Ç¨2.4 billion, the company divided the company on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special load of around ‚Ç¨2.7 billion, which will result from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55.000 jobs, which has been ongoing for three years, has not yet been completed.
At the end of the fiscal year 2013, HP employed a workforce of around 302,000 people at the end of the fiscal year 2013.
After trading, the Hewlett Packard gave 2.3 percent.
The company with printers from California's Palo Alto is currently spinning. Thus, computers and printers will be bundled into a new society this year, separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parties are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC sales, as well as a weaker demand from corporate clients for its services, set up the world's second largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to nearly 25.4 billion.
The proceeds were then returned to 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP replies to the change in the industry with a split and a massive footprint.
The 76 years old company under the guidance of Meg Whitman is late in responding to customers buying more smart phones and tablets instead of buying conventional computers and doing more business online.
Whitman restructurings plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 posts.
Conflicts: Majority support the Anti-ISA training mission

That other states fly against the IS in Iraq and in syria find 61 percent positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with the Syrian ruler, Baashar al-Assad, rejects 51% of the respondents, 20 percent of whom would be in favour.
29 percent could not decide.

R√∂szke: Violence at the Serbian Hungarian border
The Hungarian police used the border of the Serbian border at R√∂szke Trenengas and water cannons against several hundred displaced persons.
Euronews's correspondent D√°niel Bozsik experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind that was a police line formed, and behind the police there was a water cannon.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks, and plastic bottles.
The officials started uninterrupted pepper spray at the beginning.
Then the police used teargas.
Much tear gas has been evoked in the direction of the refugees.
The group was then dissolved.
The refugees have now retired somewhat.
A pregnant woman and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone.
Children who inhaled the teargas were screaming.
Other refugees dumped in themselves and suffered from breathing trouble.
Also the pressesprecher of the Serbian police suffered injuries due to the use of tearties and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the Federal Reserve meets in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, in order to make the important decision whether, for the first time, interest has been raised for almost a decade or not.
A survey of 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half the last week believed that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will remain a bit longer, and interest rates will keep at the current level of 0 - 0.25%.
ES is a historical event because it has been seven years since the Fed placed interest on NULL.
For the first time, for the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalising interest rates, said Angel Ubide, Chief of Staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is in a relatively good performance, trillions of dollars are being added to the balance sheet, generating only low inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook in global terms.
It has warned the markets of adjusting to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances of doing such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday.
Death Protests at the Delta State Academy left apologies for debt write-offs
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he turned on his colleague on Monday morning to kill his colleagues, Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he wanted him to be troubled by the first murder and wanted to make it undone, he could make it undone, held authorities on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10: 00 on Monday morning.
He said he shot on someone and killed someone.
He said to the employees of the emergency call center that the police must send police to their homes.
He said that I launched my wife yesterday evening and he also said that a swedish dog is in the house, but that no one is going to disturb anyone but probably excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not have him.
There was no explanation for his shots.
As the police the scene entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said: I wanted to do so I could do it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb killed 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of History, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by police.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea.
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt also had a relationship with Schmidt, said authorities on Tuesday, there is no information, no evidence of a triangular relationship with him.
Prentiss was named Shawn Steen, who said that she was married for about seven years when a good man was described as a man.
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was destroyed on the ground.
He said that Prentiss did her daughter to be absolutely best friends.
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, which owned a dog called Lightning, met with Lamb for about three years.
Did you always wanted to help other people, said Knowles
The police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them that he did not go to prison.
When the police arrested him on Highway 1 in the vicinity of Greenville later this night he drove his car to the side, fled to walk, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, received a doctorate from the Delta State University and received a doctorate from the University's website.
Stars that lost their luck with them?
The actor bent left, in the image with his son Redmond right, had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought for leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor allegedly fought to fight with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug ownership.
All this certainly pays tribute to it.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is building the corporation around the company.
Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring.
A half billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save money with a better organization alone.
150 of the world's nearly 1,000 executives will cost the consolidated job.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union.
Lufthansa builds up its corporate structure and evaluates the low-cost Eurowings.
The aim of realignment was a earnings contribution of around ‚Ç¨500 million a year from cost and risk synergy, the airline informed the Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will not have a Management Board in the future.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independent as possible.
In the Management Board team, the CEO of Carsten Spohr will be responsible for future Karl Ulrich Garnstadt for Eurowings.
With the repositioning, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
Up to now, the organization of the 120 000-strong company has been complex.
The airline operates under the roof of the Entry Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
Negotiations will be resumed on this Thursday after the legal strike.
The trade union was in agreement with this.
The subject of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
In this way, you will be able to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible in a year's time with a forecast record.
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
As part of the transition to the pilot, the concept of savings concept is based on two wings.
It makes Lufthansa compete with the Group's own low-cost airline, Eurowings, in the fight against competitors.

Ken Shaw from Manchester United is not playing for months on account of a twin fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right Bone during the Champions League defeat from Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this was the case for the left external defenders, and to exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not hope that Shaw will be able to play this season again.
The attack was caused by a ruthless attack by H√©ctor Moreno in 15.
He was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital.
He will be relocated tomorrow, or perhaps a day later, and then in Manchester.
ES is terrible - a boy that comes with 18 to Manchester United, it is very hard and then plays and then it happens.
In the changing room, he had an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes the six months, and he will not play in group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
It seemed fortunate that it was able to escape from a Red Card and the imposition of an Elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexicans.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an ellipsity and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack on both feet.
A Tweet on Shaw's account: I thank you all for your messages.
In terms of reference: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV.
The United Kingdom defender has an extra incentive in France to catch up until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said: "It is a very bad violation.
When a player leaves his place with this kind of injury, they are all very sad.
ES is never the intention of our players to violate an opponent.
He suffered a great deal when Mexico played against Van Gaar as a Dutch team at the 2014 World Cup.
It is very difficult for him to do so because it was not his intention to violate the opponent, and if you hear that it is a very serious injury, it is not good, said Cocu.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball in a different direction, so it looked like he had touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In talking to SBS6, Moreno: I know how it feels like it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel very poor, I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andr√©s Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a Foulder by Chris Smalling.
Certainly, David Cameron's The Lorax knows better?
ES is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favourite child book, the Prime Minister decided for The Lorax, which was released in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
ES was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a news on the site of Supercamps, and continues: Having fun, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I want to read out to my children, for it seems to be always an image or a message that we have so far missed.
All well and well, except that the subsequent paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, instead reflects a summary of the movie version of 2012, which added new characters and details to extend the fairly brief original text.
In the middle of the silent town of Thneed-Ville, where everything has gone, and even the air is a commodity, a boy called Ted hopes to win a boy called Ted, the heart of Audrey, to win the girl of his dreams, in order to see their desire to see a real tree, to watch a real tree, to read a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to watch a real tree, to
As if it were not yet suspicious enough: The text submitted by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the report from the Lorax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins: In the silent town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is artificial, a boy called Ted hopes to win a boy called Ted, the heart of Audrey to win the girl of his dreams.
Although he is in favour of being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron would be so familiar with Cameron that he is so familiar with the book's plot, which hears an unnamed boy, such as the local environment caused by the money-crayfish, tumours, thinnings of once-lers, in spite of the protests of the name-bearing Lorax, a name-bearing Lorax, which is destroyed in the name of the trees in the name of the trees.
As a result, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper that the Lorax did not read 20 times a sequence of a child.
One Downing Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron's staff, but there were no other immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with the exclusion of England's crew, but it is still difficult.
Reaching Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the kader that England has selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test victory is not on my card.
I would not rule out an upward victory.
Alastair Cooks site may be less than those three years ago, but there are good players in the raid setting, and the community spirit is strong; they will not have any scars from 2012, only a youthful and positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown size on the test stage, is an option for attack.
Report on related news: Adam Lyth SCHEIDET from the England Test-Kader and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to expel Adam Lyth is, of course, to be difficult for me as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
During its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are aligned on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, as - and I said this earlier - players are their own best selection.
Long ago, he would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he seems to be turning his way back to Yorkshire, there is another chance.
The British coach met Trevor Bayliss, even if he did not deliver as good as he did, and that does not surprise me; it is especially a team man.
The question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and forward.
The only accusation that can be made was that England used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in a maximum form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in and he is a drummer whom I admire.
He is an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early in this season, when he met 236 against us on a Trent Bridge Square, which we met very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but this depends, of course, on the team's position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen together with Cook, what would be an additional spiin-Bowler and four chicks would have appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I cannot see why a drummer cannot beat there, and this left-handed has already shown that he is a vicious circle of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no big difference.
My former team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop before he appeared as Opener in 2001.
He made three hundred of us immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the kader as Back-up-Spinner, and in my limited treatment with him he has impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his stats - on average 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and think, it is a Punt, but there is no large number of backup spiders that charge their hands and the coaches have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England has made some wise additions to the training.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master ercoup.
He is one of the quietest solos of the game, which will bring lots of experience, as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful stake in the setup.
I always felt he was created for the international cricket contest, as a player or as a coach, and how Mahela has gained insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes, new voices can be brought to the changing rooms, even if the messages are in line with what has been said before.
Collys team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One Dayers, root received a similar break against Australia and for my part, I have no problem with it.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team leaders do not determine the timetable.
And you must bear in mind that, as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
The Brexite Desert Brexit = US exit from the EU could gain from gains if the economy in 2017 in a swarped economy by the year 2017.
David Cameron's unfinished renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every passing day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy is Yes or No?
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European Diploma, and recently, said that some member states are so deeply enmeshed in various crises, such as the EU, and not always from its own guilt, Britain's self-created agenda, with divided concessions and disturbing treaty changes, which most of them do not want to do.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at their annual general assembly that it does not like it if it puts social protection at risk.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie's agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbing to summit meetings or business meetings in foreign capitals, make a photo of himself before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
ES is always about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK looking to look outside of the EU tent, is not alone with France, says Berlin - and can see that more and more shortsighted ministers and civil servants have come to some of the capital cities to the point they do not care about whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years, and wants to leave it before it looks bad for her, as it is for the excessively long drawnups like Thatcher, Mitterrand's 11 years, Mitterrand in 14, and Kohl, 14, and Kohl, 16 of whom is going on.
France's Fran√ßois Hollande is looking for his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
It is also a verbal force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left one.
ES is hard to imagine that they will tear off a leg to help the Selfie-Britons, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want, because most of these are similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, perhaps some such ministers may even deliberately plan not helpful comments, entirely in SNPstyle, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017 to speed the Brexite process suspects my friend.
The renegotiation was a bankruptcy and the United Kingdom did not win anything from the renegotiation.
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be on its costs and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press, as it did during the 1975 inspired referendum, which supported our entry into force in 1973, with a ratio of 2: 1.
They can be weak to Boris Johnson, the pro-euro opportunist, who has turned a name rather than a European Union of Russia, in the early 1990" s, in the early 90's.
With all his reverence, Ed Miliband knew who was his enemies.
This was part of the Medley of fiscal conservatism, telephone hacking foreigners and the pseudo-non-inlands that have the majority of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought to be similar to her, but he found that when you are sitting in a cage with a hot Gorilla, you are distributed better bananas to distract him instead of becoming a lunch and dinner.
Indeed, most of the militia were more Blairians than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameron's cabinet dispute, because Blair had the principle of the EU's not adopted constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened up a back door to it in 2005.
He has never seen him in the press.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs to waste time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnos's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80's, then and today.
ES can take but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC-Sofa left on Sunday.
Corbyns official position for Europe is - I remind you - in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukips, traditional sanctuaries, and the wild birds of Tory's small-minism, can say 'yes' to everyone in favour.
It is what Hilary called a Benn, but no Bennite Benn on the radio and on television this week said, when the pathfinder in him fought not to admit that Corbyns's nomination of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70-he years when his old father worked on television to be imloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilarys's struggle was even more attractive.
But to fight to keep up under all circumstances - Benns expressed - was not what McDonnell said, or what JC told his companions and Members after all reports at their trial meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever it wants to mediate by Corbyn, remember that he has even been attracted to me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the Strule of the Social Media, a breeding ground of Paranoia and betrayal.
ES is right to not give Cameron carte blanche for Europe, which allows you to keep our support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins believes in such a way.
But McDonnell and Corbyns basic ambiguities about EU membership - in line with its incarnite siege economy, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguity about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to withdraw, foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if everything can make sense?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, in Libya, and in Syria, even with a reduction in the tory government in power, which I called the British influenza Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Statements from a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was made up of a meeting of 12 people, partly with links with the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write about BMJ in the British Medical Journal, joined Lancet by criticizing the certificates used by Public Health England in their report on e-cigarettes.
Phe published the report's basic report last month, describing him as a comprehensive review of the evidence.
However, a number of researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and have drawn attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A key item in the medical journal Lancet last month saw the presence of extraordinarily windy base, based on the Phe founded his most important conclusion.
Two other researchers wrote in BMJ and wondered if the allegations of stones or sand built up were built up.
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness."
You said that the public expects the assertion of Phe that the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking is based on a detailed verification of evidence and modeling.
Indeed, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been called to develop a model for a multi-criterion decision analysis based on multi-criterion decision analysis - MCDA in order to produce a synthesis of their opinions on the damage of different nicotine products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director previously received British American Tobacco Resources from BAT for an independent study.
He also wrote the references from BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting declared themselves to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but did not add to the funding that they had previously received from Philip Morris International after reports.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not delivered, but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate a branch funding in paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting took place also the tobacco line of Phe.
The research carried out by the group is significantly attributed to the fact that there is a lack of sound proof of the damage of most products in most of the criteria, namely McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of Phe that there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are considered a way of smoking for children or non-smokers were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at Phe, said that the claims of BMJ have already been responded previously.
He said: Waste e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.
Every second lifetime smoker is dying of his or her quest.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
Phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence does and what they do not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in relation to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from smoking, and smoking costs two billion Euros per year for the National Health Service.
By giving proof of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should abandon EastEnders, says a former boss of Channel 4.
The former chair of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop writing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals, like Albert Square Soap, would give their right arm to their right arm.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK subscribers.
He criticized the BBC for placing public programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard disputed time windows against the most popular shows of its rivals and of broadcasters like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall said that they wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that for six years in his time at Channel 4, he tried to get in touch with the BBC without success.
I have problems with the idea that BBC has commissioned or broadcast programs that are also clearly shown by non-subsidized rivals," said Johnson the Oberhaus-Communication Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep up the radio, which is not a good idea for me in the medium or long term, you should at least rate the production at least on programmes that others do not make or put into place.
They send the Voice in a first-class window of time, because they want to achieve maximum support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this would be a joke; it is ridiculous; it is, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said: I cannot see why a regressive tax financed programs that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly, both in-house productions.
To be honest, other channels would be their right arm for them.
I shall look at how this is to be on public television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is to blame for the hunt for ratings was due to the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support.
His comments on the most popular broadcasts from the BBC give this again what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in his Mactaggart-lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public niche programs should go to BBC4, where you cannot measure the audience, but they perform their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their seeming holy missions to justify 4 billion ¬£, Now, of course, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen.
They put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see it.
On radio charges, Johnson said the Committee: I invite you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can gain the best value from it.
Of course, think all of them, we all think that to get a big value for 150 pounds a year here, but for people who are in favour of 150 ¬£a lot of money, I wonder if that is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky- and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who, on Tuesday, pointed out to the committee, called for the BBC to check their Reithian mission to inform, educate, educate and talk about it.
He said that only little of BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it is 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should be an example to the public television channels in Australia and Canada, and they should give an example to the public television channels in Australia and Canada, to inform, educate and discuss in advance.
On the question of partnerships, Elstein, the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Proms, of whom he said that only a handful are shown on television, and to discuss with commercial channels alliances to make everything online available.
Sonogenetics, brain cells can be taxed by means of sound waves.
The video shows how the Nematoid will change the direction of the moment in which it is irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms from genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction in the moment in which they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human hearing to be heard.
The stimulus works by switching on Motoneuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Next to this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, which can be used in the ultrasound to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, the researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, USA, told the Guardian that one day, the Guardian said that the process could replace the deep-down brain stress, an invasive procedure that gives an electric impulse to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fadenworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, reinforce the ultrasound waves that then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves work on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some pot cells.
Sound waves generate the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to, such as Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound controlled nematods, Chalasani were genetically modified to carry some of their motoneurons TRP-4 ion channels.
When he uses ultrasound to apply the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn them into the changed motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with impulses of the light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light emitted from an optical fibre to the desired place in the brain, low frequency ultrasonic waves can happen freely and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible that the intended human neurons are temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical position for certain neurological treatments, said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.

The Giving of Britain's Coatings of Arms
Amnesty International anti-weapons messenger video watch.
Terrible terrorist attacks!
Tablespoon mitter smelling balls!
Cluster bombs!
And there is no trace left behind, but there is no trace left behind.
The Fr√∂hlich voice and the cartoons on images leave no doubt that this display of the world's largest weapon fair is a belligerent parody produced by Amnesty International to put the British government in the spotlight to kill arms to repressive regimes in the ExCeL Centre in London's docklands.
Trot: DSegg Weapon Trade Fair: Authoritarian regime flows into London
But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are to be seen at bus stops and in the metro trains, which require a second glance.
Important announcement: Drive from 15 to 18. September with the DLR? With the DLR???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
In September, a sweat of arms dealers with DLR are driving customers to help in stopping the weapon fair.
The 300 posters are made by artists who have exhibited their work in the museum for cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped to distribute in London and used Ad Space Hack Packs, a 6 ¬£-pack from Inbuskeyn, which claims to have access to about a third of the bus station advertising space on the planet Erlangen.
Transport for London finds it not funny at this poster of vandalism.
One of the Parodie-ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and Lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists commit themselves with activists in protest movements to the work and say they need to go outside into the real world, so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon posters eats the commuters in the underground.
The Amnesty video was seen more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the marketing agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and Voiceover-artist who is also working for free.
VCCP-Creative Director Matt Lever was astonished by the silence that prevailed around the advertising of the weapons trade - and thought: To give them the campaign they try to avoid, we give them the campaign they try to avoid.
They played with the invention of a more realistic and realistic company advertising, but it remains more powerful through the insertion of bright colors and animation.
Have you made a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal end devices at the fair to sharpen, says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors find brilliant euphemistics.

Heaps of golden Rules for Life in student residences
Eleven years ago, I took as a self-forgotten 19-year-old worker in a student residence, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tight smiles of those who annoyed me - and to the many long-standing complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student residence ranges from easily ventilated to totally terrifying.
It is tempting to scorn: People tell where you come from, whether and where you have taken Sabbath, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you do not love you in relation to Corbyn, and why you do not love to be honest with Marmite neither love nor hate, because in seriousness, guys, it's just a yeast extract hahaha, I am in my room.
Breathing it through.
And help others to do the same - find questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like, unlike those with whom you would not speak, even if your eyelashes were in fire and this fire extinguisher would be.
Let people.
The rooms of people are often turned into beverage recipes, movie night venues and communal meeting places, but they are also the places in which people attract and their underwear.
Present: Do not think that you can start with a relationship at the university.
Introduced received a rough treatment at the university.
Their room was supposed to be a refuge, but many student residences form a spatial space culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who tries to catch up.
Nothing in culture allows you to say: I like it, and I want our friendship to continue, but you must go away so that I return the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you.
Try to feel when a commilitone is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Spropos to pick up: Do it.
A candle in my student residences had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship close by baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the back-manie, the clamps to the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brownies, less strange than welcoming the 1950-er years of welcome to the neighborhood, I gave you something, and now please smile if I ask you a couple of personal questions.
It is a good way to close friendships with them.
Your fellow residents feel obliged to live with them and, in the end, will probably associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Dirty clumps of flour, sugar and fat result in people sleeping asleep when you knock.
Food to steal is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, the mouth of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea?
Check that with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that they say to themselves, even if they cook at home.
If someone steals your belongings, this is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to make them more balanced than my fellow citizen who added their milk to her milk to punish thieves.
It is now in prison.
They should not make noise that prevents people from sleep or work.
It is not just about being a decent man; it is, in the truest sense of the term, people belonging to the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my corridor asked her neighbours whether there is something to put drum & bass something quieter, because it had three o'clock in the morning, and they had an exam in the morning.
They responded to them with even Lauterer Musik.
Finally, when they heard at 5 o'clock, they kindly slept their neighbors for two hours before they had their own music plotted, closed their door and went to their three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic for your future spouse to enter the same student residence in the same student residence?
Conversely, if you hold a fellow person for your future marriage, would it not be deeply embarrassing if you stand up for your future spouse, turn to them, look again and see them every day and maybe witness them all the friends of each other?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot companion is definitely not your future spouse, try, at least, to imagine a little sense of purpose.
At the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has got his keys in his not finished room, the boundary between an ulk and bullying is more refined than it seems.
A good skill is funny, but it takes only a few moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Sign up a valuable and amusing lesson on security, but do not miss anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and put your keys in a glass of water, which you put in the freezer - but you do not put your possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building in the Central Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have much money.
For example, for refugees, but also as a signal: Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low earners.
If I show you how to grow today and build well, the 44-year-old says in the interview.
Thousands of refugees are being forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in how fast cheap housing can be created: He is building in a project for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees are going to push for the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass storage in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
For people remain to a large part here.
Given the flow of refugees, we need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least seat.
It makes integration easier.
That is different when people are subdued in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each of the four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
ES can be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can be converted easily to the specific needs.
What are the costs?
Guild: The price of 160 m2 of living space per house is EUR 184 000, without plot.
That is manageable.
Six months have taken place.
That is appropriate.
Have the building rules complicated their plans?
Guild: I have checked my project correctly.
It always makes the threat of Damocles special construction and the parking place regulation.
Gruselig.
It is still assumed that if you create three apartments in a terraced house you will need at least three camping sites.
Only in the cities there is no place for that.
Refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react on their terraced home project?
Gildner: ES gave people who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What definitely is not true.
But do not aggravate the competitive battle for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True is true: We have built a building boom in Germany over the past five years, but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, the ordinary people need housing as well.
Not only refugees, but also single mothers or the low earners.
I am showing you how to be able to build and build well today.
That is what it is about.
Markus Gildner's 44 head studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially worked with environmental analyses.
Ios 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is published.
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, in general type in general, and then select Software update.
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, because they receive an error message indicating that the software update has failed.
To avoid the problem, users are encouraged to either wait until the storm or try to upgrade to iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it to be less likely due to the acceleration of the update, and it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and re-install them when the process is finished.
It is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is recharged during update or is close to a charger, so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, since the phone may be shut down, and may result in a crash of the update.

Rosberg's sole motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows more about the fight for the WMF title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes-team-mates Lewis Hamilton.
The World Championship II pointed out before the start into the crucial seven crossing races, that I have nothing more to lose.
53 points are separated by the vice-champion before trading in Singapore on this Sunday of title defender and second champion Hamilton.
The British have already won seven of the previous twelve seasons and is also a favorite player in the popular city of the city.
Last year and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have influence on Singapore's Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days a Dunn bell hangs over the city caused by fires on the neighbouring island Sumatra.
The Kissinger Squad Club has a prominent member.
Three months ago, the chess club created chess player Bad Kissingen has joined another member in his ranks, so the membership number increased to 19 players.
The new member is Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess player and tennis player who has spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is a member of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Tourism of Espelkamp and L√ºbbecke.
In Bad Kissingen's chess club, Gauselmann has supported him with a donation that led to the chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee.
Youth employment and talent search are to be promoted as well.
Gauselmann wants to be a member of the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Wei√ü" as an expression of his affinity with the spa town.
Vicinity offices are looking for direct contact.
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined together under the umbrella of the social foundation and have opened up a new point of contact at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to discussions, we can also participate in courses.
The social foundation goes down from the mountain into the city centre.
More precisely to the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
Recently a new district office office was opened there.
Here, immediately next to the purchasing market, seniors and seekers for advice on issues such as health insurance, health care and nursing homes are now being given immediate access.
For years now we have been working with our ambulance service to ensure that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are an endless number of questions.
In addition to this, it is not uncommon to claim many benefits from the coffers, because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood as a result of this, explained by the new housekeeper in Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Belizean Aid for Belistift and the Civic Hospital, as well as for the ambulance service of the University of Amadeus.
In addition to the discussions, the new district office also offers prevention, health care and wellness.
To this end, the Saludis was taken on board.
Therefore it is possible to use additional offers such as cancellation prevention, memory training or therapy.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
The People's Centre for Care and Care is the Senior Centre for Care and Care, called Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is particularly in view of demographic change.
Because it is essential to have a good central infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, in such a way, the town of Wolfgang Metzner, a member of the University of Wolfgang Metzner, is also a member of the Department of the Arts.
As a result, the Social Foundation makes a significant contribution to ensuring that seniors live as independent and as possible in their familiar surroundings.
The travel office office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9: 00 to 14: 00, Tuesday and Thursday from 16: 00 to 18: 00 and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 noon.
Confession Bamberg vs. W√ºrzburger Kickers on 6 October 2007.
It is now official: After a period of renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion the deadline for the match for the match FC Bamberg against the third party of W√ºrzburger Kickers has not yet been established, the date has been fixed for 6 October as the deadline.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the sixth finals of the Bavarian Football Totopokals against the third party FC W√ºrzburger Kickers has been fixed for a long time now.
The tournament will be held on Tuesday, 6 October, at 19: 00 in the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
We are glad that we now know when the game is going, and now we have the certainty of planning security, according to FCE Team Manager Karlheinz H√ºmmer, who also points to the now available map pre-sale.

The architect Karl Mang 92-years passed away.
Karl Mang, one of the founders of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.

Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but has also worked as a teacher, writer and institute conductor.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 80s he was commissioned with the establishment of the treasury at the Vienna Imperial Palace and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theatre Museum.

Former footballer Tim meadow noticed in Bremen.
In the meantime Tintin, ex-national temple owner in Germany and Bremen and Hopen in Germany, joined Wrestler.
According to our own statement, 30 kg of muscle mass is to be added over the past two years.

When stormed up the business, the beamer insulted her and threw her the due fine of her feet, as the image grower magazine reported.
At the city of Bremen it is confirmed by the accusations, it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
Finding the thing is still in the exam, it is called from the city of Bremen.
Only after that, whether a meadow is displayed or not.
Authorities in Panama destroy 4500 Marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the climate of the Isla del Rey are well suited for the cultivation of marijuana.
For three days now the authorities Panamas have been pulling the 4500 plants out of and burn them.
Men have been tested against 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salm√ºnster: On Friday evening, on Friday, 23: 45, three young men were on the way to Salm√ºnster on foot from Bad Soden.
One out of the group, a 17 year old Afghane, followed according to the police his two friends in a distance of about five feet and told them to wait for him.
At that time the group was on the height of the bft-Tanker.
There are also three people on the petrol station.
One of these men cried out to the youngsters and beat them into the face.
The victim suffered a lot from his nose in this regard, and he was shocked by the nose.
When his two friends strived and appease the racquins, this was initially caused by his victim.
From his friends, the injured young man has been brought home.
The perpetrator tracked the group with a car to their apartment and ran more than once.
When the vehicle was not seen, the injured were in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
He was attacked again by the racquet and another male person.
Under the help of a stroke, one had to pay attention to the face and the thighs of the victim.
The injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague pattern of work.
One of the men was about 1.80 metres large.
The second racquet should have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown white shirt.
The police are asking for witnesses and referees to sign up to a 100-123 telephone number on 06181.
Dr. Frank M√ºller takes into practice Feldenausen and invests 310000 Euro.
Mrs M√ºller-Gongoll and Frank M√ºller from the left side assume the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Feldenausen.
He is also a member of the Board of Directors of Bernd Bormann, Wirtschaftsf√∂rderung in Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country there is a shortage of doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: He takes over Dr. Frank M√ºller on 1 October 2004.
While Ursel Feldenausen is going to retire, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, returns to his successor over the next few months with half a place.
After a reconstruction period, M√ºller opens the practice on 12 October, until then, until then he is investing 310000 Euros in the premises on the S.Marcellusstra√üe 6.
There was a sense of sympathy at first sight than Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller-Gongoll, who are currently working on their medical training at the Verden Hospital and who would like to join in practice this year, as well.
We have always had in mind that the dumpers would be well suited to this practice, Dr. Ursel Feldenausen and laughs.
As if it were as it was, I simply called it out.
The married couple, M√ºller, liked the idea of doing their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
Close and constant contact with the patients is very attractive to us, says the 39-year-old M√ºller.
We want to get to know the families over the years and accompany them.
As an advantage he will also be able to be his boss soon.
And thus they were agreed that the refuse ers bought the house with practice.
However, accommodation will continue to be in quarry Vilsen.
There, the two-fold family of Frank M√ºller grew up, his physiology in Hanover followed stations in several doctors' offices and in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently the Chief Medical Officer in Sulingen, and in 2009 he has been appointed a senior doctor in the district of Diepholz and is involved in volunteer work at breakage Vilsen in the DRC.
Starting from 19 September, the practice is prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon is working in the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Feldenausen as a family doctor, his wife Ursel Ursel specialises in gastroenterology.
The M√ºllers, both internists, want to settle down as family physicians.
Therefore, endoscopy is getting out, says the 38-year-old Silvia M√ºller-Gongoll.
After reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic tests as well as long term and load EKGs and need a speakers room more.
In addition, the computer system will be completely renewed.
A total grant of a total of 50000 Euro will be given to the M√ºllers in the context of a grant program from the district of EUR 25000 Euro plus of the Samoese community 12500 Euros and the community of approximately 12500 euros.
This shows how proud we are and we are glad that the practice continues to be carried out, emphasises Samton Councillors Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia M√ºller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come every quarter to the practice field breaks, and in the North German average practice there are about 500.
In Asendorf there are still a lot of in-house surgery practice.
A positive side effect from Frank M√ºller: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Feldenausen.
If no successor would have found it, it would have gone.
Anyone who visits M√ºller's meeting hour will also continue to look above all in familiar faces: Takes over the seven medical staff and the cleaning power from the field.
With their passing off in Asendorf, there is an era for 30 years, after all, for 30 years.
At the beginning, we had only two rooms, the Ursel reminds of Feldenausen.
After a long time, they feel a bit of anger.
We are still living in Hohenmoor and many patients will still often see it, says the boarding school.
Her husband adds to laughter: We have a 6000-square meter.
So far, up until now, I have always been in front of gardening, but now it could be different.
In addition, the pair has two horses and is happy to travel.
Croatia: We put the refugees off the streets by means of housing.
As a result, border controls will also rise on our southern border," said Internal Minister Johanna Miklahn.
The controls at the Hungarian border are continuing along the same lines.
As before, it is clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can, of course, make it possible for them to do so.
The care and safety of people are in the foreground.
However, be clear, too, that it needs clear signals, the Minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migration flows, not even on the Austro-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering a corridor for accession - Slovenia denied
The Croatian Government had previously told us that Slovenia also wanted to move towards Austria and Germany, and possibly also set up corridors for the refugees.
Thus, the Minister of the Interior, Vesna Gy√∂rk√∂s Znidar, did not see it in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors would be totally unacceptable on the grounds that Slovenia would intensify the surveillance of the border, especially on Hungary.
The border with Croatia, however, is already heavily controlled as an external border for the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenians want to see their limits for refugees in such a way that they do not have borders.
The members of the EU member must fill out their obligations, otherwise the system cannot work, Mr Gy√∂rk√∂s Znidar.
As the Croatian Government said, the first refugees would have already been trying, in the night hours of Tuesday, to go to Ostkroatien at the Tovarnik's border crossing, to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick up them in the sectors of the region.
According to local media, Seitden in the Croatian Tovarnik is constantly entering police vehicles with new refugees.
This is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in place.
In the next few days his country is counting about 4.000 refugees, he said Secretary of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo to the Macedonian Serb border, which so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, were diverted to Croatia, and the Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, believed that it would be wise to change certain routes: We still want to be able to do it, nor do we want to do so.
According to the media reports, at least in the morning they arrived a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border city of sid, in the course of the day, additional buses would be expected.
Through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria into Germany
The occupants were on the road all night to the Macedonian border of Serbia, which was around 500 kilometres away.
We have heard that Hungary has added, so the police have told us that we are going to go here, said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
In fact, it is now true that, in fact, to observers, the previous Balkan Route, Turkey's former Macedonians - Serbia-Serbia-Hungary - will be turning into a somewhat farther west way.
Croatia: Comprehensive ways of controlling border controls
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously emphasised that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention he, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had a wide range of options for controlling border controls.
Control is carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 and the EU partners have a good record on the country of Seitden, as far as the standard of border control is concerned.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they would have spent the last night at the border crossing Horgos, which leads to R√∂szke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossing points Horgos and Backi Breg remain closed.
Whether the remaining refugees are now seeking to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Minister for the Interior, Nebojsa Stefanovic, tried to pacify Wednesday morning at a local eye sign in horgos: It is premature for the debates on alternative routes for refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be a very large number of refugees at the moment.
It is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Workers" urge migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to channel maps out for refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are drawn.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: In parts of the border, there will still be more than 20 years after the end of the Bosnian war.
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine mines was sent to the border region.
Stock hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is designed to be a ring of cyber-crime that has been accused since 2010 to have an insight into yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketing Marketing and PR Newswire.
The exploited information is intended to make insider-trading on the financial markets.
In this way, according to investigators, a total of more than $100 million was launched.
Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught up in the SEC communication.
The processes against 32 additional indictments in the case lasted.
Most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted both in the US and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospizure Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years.
There is a lot of operation going on around the Mannheim-Hochplatz.
The people do their worries, sometimes very fast steps, partly comfortable.
You control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalons.
City lanes are held.
At the end of the day, you will be able to see all your life in a beautiful autumn sun pass and in the middle of four big plates with the title of the title.
The Ecumenical hospital aid has drawn attention to its 20-year existence with this action and is facing mixed reactions.
We are talking about life, so we have gone through the action in the middle of the city and among the people, tells Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospital is also available for questions and talks as well as volunteer workers.
While some seem to be spontaneous to chalk and the sentence to keep my life in favor of my life in favor of my life in favor of my life in the eyes of my life in the eyes of my life in the eyes of the USA, you can read, read, talk to the camper by the USA, stop the war, stop the war, or if you do not have a long time, stay in touch with others, read words, say sentences such as such as have not done so far, and go on, then go on and go on.
Time and again, there is little discussion on the action in itself, about the life, the way of dying.
Also Peter H√ºbinger is just in place.
Only if I make it clear to me that for me at some time the end of this world comes, I can live responsibly, says the director of the Diakonic Plant Mannheim, which is jointly with the Caritasverband carrier of the Ecumenical Hospital aid.
This is why this high-profile action is going on for 20 years.
Not all of them want to be informed on the screen, however understandable, after all, this is a very personal thing.
The subject of death and death still remains with taboos, such as the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the Hospizational movement in recent years has contributed greatly to the opening up of people.
An assessment by Angelika Godefroid.
The employee of death is one of the honorary members of the first hour.
Through personal experience confronted with the subject, they read a lot of literature and decided to be involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospital was looking for honorary official searches, they were immediately notified and would have been in place when they were founded in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 honorary - 43 women and two men - the affected person in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospiz St Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal with her task and the experiences and experiences that come out of it.
I see life from a different thing, consider it to be precious and treasure the moment of being, says it.
The offer of the Ambulant Ecumenical Hospital is free and nonsensical.
The financial support provided by the health insurance funds and donations from family members and associations allows the training and training and supervisions of the stereaters.
All two years are offered training for new employees.
The panels on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Evangelical Church in the house of the Church of M1, 1a in and in the house of the Catholic Church in the middle of the church of F2, 6.
Here you can also find more personal wishes on postcards.
FedEx Results mixed, financial prospects for 2016,
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the Linear Gigant lowered its winning view over a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight and higher costs in its naval service service.
The company also said that it plans to recruit about 55,000 seasonal workers for a holiday.
At this point in the past year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share fell to more than 2.5 percent in Premarket trading 45 minutes prior to the opening of Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to make a profit from $10,40 to $10,90 in fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than in previous prediction.
Analysts expected a 10.84 $as a result of a survey conducted by FactSet.
Despite the price increases, which averaged 4.9% on 4 January and despite higher charges for ground transport for heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November, they will come into effect despite the price increases.
The company said that it expects the result to be higher than the previous year due to cost reduction, higher income, and growth in online trading.
As CEO Fred Smith said, the company is delivering solid returns when considering weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trading.
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS, which plans to discontinue 90.000 to 95.000 additional workers, such as the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share that 12 of Zack Investment Research predicted analysts predicted.
Sales grew by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks wanted analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipments in recent years, bringing sales in its unity Express Shipping to Stagnzing.
But the online shopping boom has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transport increased 29 percent, but the operational result was basically flat for higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell as a result of higher labor costs in freight.
In Premarket Trade, around an hour before opening, the FedEx shares were $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150,15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June.
On their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve strategists held two days this week to sit around a 27-foot sales-mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise for the first time for nearly a decade.
Drover over them at the end of the condensed, two-storey meeting room is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Central Bank has held a two-fold mandate from Congress: To keep US employment and prices stable.
But, since the Great Recession, the Fed has recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate may be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, which will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to emerge from the unprecedented incentive of the short-term short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most data on the economy show that they are growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make it more difficult for the global financial markets to make these volatility by raising interest rates on federal bonds - even if only a quarter of the percentage point.
On the contrary, the job market and inflation will be the most important thing they see," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economics at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
However, I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase interest rates, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is still sufficient justification, to continue waiting, said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed is doing, which in itself distorts the financial market.
Nearly half of economists who have recently been interviewed by Bloomberg have predicted a rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect a Fed waiting, with a key indicator that indicates only a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a fall in the stock market, if the Fed increases the rate, unless it slows down the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average averaged 228,89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed maintained the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
But it would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at this point, he said.
If they do, they would have to go very far to reassure financial markets so that they do not panic.
Other experts argued that an interest rate would reassure financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed on the right track to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the momentum of rest in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that, despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be required, they expect an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that the Fed sees as full of full employment.
Wages have shown signs of recovery.
And, while inflation was steadily below the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, the leaders said that the main cause was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market, as Ian Shepherdown, chief economist at the Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
But financial markets around the world rose at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average was over 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in China's economy would reduce global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, while the Dow is now almost 10% below the point of May.
For the Fedora Representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when you should increase interest rates.
If the events on the financial markets and the news about the Chinese economy's weakness in the last few weeks would not have occurred, they would rally in this sitting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former US Federal Reserve team.
Now he says that they will wait at least a month to better manage the impact.
There is a lot of uncertainty about what will affect the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing Chinese developments," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main priorities of the Fed, so it should not be taken into account technically in its decision-making.
But, in the end, the Fed's monetary authority has become the world.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere reference of the former leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 to the Fed's ability to narrow down their monetarist expansion, triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly interwoven, they can be expected to be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to better understand the global economy.
Your decision making is more art than science, he said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that the Fed has a history of overreaction to financial market movements that, apparently, are not linked to economic fundamentals.
If he is a member of the Federal Open Market Committee's member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he is calling for an increase in interest rates in 1998 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to reduce its interest rate to 0.75 percentage points in three meetings, despite limited recognition effects on growth in the US, he said.
One year on, the Fedora Representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the collapse of the World Trade Organization in 2008," said Adam S. Pozna≈Ñ, former member of the Committee on the Interest of the Bank of England.
Recent turbulence does not come close to this level, he said.
She certainly does not want to fall into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest, because the markets are getting upset, said Pozna≈Ñ, President of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it is changed, I do not believe it should precede the time.

Hoyerswerda: Life support for refugees
More and more refugees are coming to Germany these days.
To prepare a warm welcome, not without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are a number of people in Hoyerswerda, too, who support altruistic asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher in her life.
She is still able to inform her with his 74 lungs.
Every Thursday it deals with the Dillinger Strasse in the asylum seeker of the asylum seeker.
There, it helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is entirely different teaching than in a real school.
Brazil's Basque society Rio Grande promotes diet for women breastfeeding.
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS is trying, in a shocking manner, to explain to women how important a good diet is during breastfeeding, which is doing this with the presentation of images of babies that suck in breasts that are painted with images of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a large number of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant mothers and young mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only editable adjustment that should make mothers.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal council at Bernried authorised the construction application for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof must be flat for solar panels.
The planning for the long awaited Turnhallenbau at the Bernrieder Sports Area is a step forward: In the most recent town council meeting the elaborated construction motion was unanimously approved without much debate.
Prior to that, the Board decided, among other things, to adopt a request for a construction law waiver in respect of an exemption from the existing construction plan.
In the case of the exception of the exception, it was a question of permission for a special shape with regard to roof construction.
As a result, a military roof with non-joining First and roof roof should be set up.
Background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar panels: Thus, we get a wonderfully large south roof together, explained mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In the case of the release of liberation, it turned to the roof, which for energy reasons - unlike in the Buildings - is required - to be under ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A release of liberation was necessary because of the fact that the building plan on the roof slope does not allow any exceptions on the roof.
However, this is not a recurring project: We do not create a precedent, so Steigenberger.
The Turnhallenbau at the sports centre is a community project for the municipality and the SV Bernried.
A total cost of around EUR 2.3 million is calculated.
Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports promotion.
In the next stage of the process, the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now submitted to the Landratin for examination.
Clinic Pei√üenberg moves to Schongau
The Hospital Pei√üenberg is to be closed earlier than scheduled - 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer is appointed a new medical director at the hospital in Schongau.
The station as well as the majority of the staff move from Pei√üenberg to Schongau.
This is reflected in the surprising plans of the hospital in the country, which has been confirmed by the Landr√§tin Andrea Jochner whites.
However, a decision on this will take place on the basis of the Supervisory Board, and it will take place next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees would be further occupied at the hospital in Pei√üenberg.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the still existing interior station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, so Jochner-Wei√ü.
The employees are informed about the plans.
The change is caused by the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and has now changed to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who is due to succeed, according to Jochner-Wei√ü, the name comes from the name of family fishermen, who agreed to take over the lead from 1 October and to switch with his team to Shongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a credit appreciation and a broadening of the offer in the field of internal medicine, so Jochner-Wei√ü.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau's 180 beds are specialized on gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
For the next two years, for the next two years, the same applies to fishermen with his team when the Supervisory Board agrees to accept both houses, until then, until next year, the former hospital in the Czech Republic, which has more than 35 beds, to be definitively closed in Pei√üenberg after almost 140 years.
Until now, the district had planned for 2018 if the current restructuring at the Weilheim hospital was completed.
Landr√§tin Jochner-Wei√ü, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, met rumors that the House, which is in possession of the Federal Reserve, was to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future.
As a result, Jochner Wei√ü could not say that there are several considerations.
At the moment there is a short-term care of caritas and a daily psychiatrics.
What better could not be done, What better could not pass, such an opportunity does not come again, so fishermen about the quasi-move to the Lech, which was received in a positive and very sympathetic manner by the staff members.
There is no real prospect for the house in which fishermen have been working as a doctor for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer Members to take over the department of the Medical Director.
The hospital of Pei√üenberg's once 100 beds have been forced over the past decades in recent decades, departments have been closed down, for example the surgery and the support of the country.
The hands of the Rhein-Neckar lions are called for at the Bergisches HC this evening at 8.15 pm.
In Wuppertal, however, the leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite, but there is no such thing as arrogance.
In the past season, the Badener took a painful defeat at the BHC and could do something about it.
Hunting, with two injured at Pratau,
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the crash on a corn field at Pratau's district of Wittenberg, several hunters were in use, as the police told.
After a shot was carried out, a 32 and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and have been brought in hospitals.
How exactly the accident could come was initially unclear.
The criminal investigation is being carried out.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crime
A suspect is the police force of the 16 age group that has been missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate.
At the end of the 20th anniversary, young people were killed and their corpses thrown into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old girl from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday has fallen victim to violent crime.
The young woman's body was found at the Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, such as the Public Prosecutor's Office and the police on Wednesday.
As a suspect, a 20-year-old boy was also held on the Tuesday evening, who, according to him, pointed the way and led the investigators to find the site of the corpse.
The 16-year-old was missing on Sunday morning, after a visit to Rockenhausen on the eve of a visit to Rockenhausen did not happen as agreed.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
In the context of interviews with friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was, after all, a menace to the 20-year age.
The alleged perpetrator brought the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the corpse was found.
According to the authorities, the authorities reported in police interrogation that the 16-year-old was killed and that the corpse were placed on the channel.
The 20-year anniversary should be shown on Wednesday to the port judge, the investigators put his death to the load.
Detailed information on the near circumstances is intended to bring further investigation.
Refugees need shelter: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tight.
More and more refugees are also looking for affordable prices.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distributional struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
More and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded with the incoming refugees and jobseekers from the EU.
They are competing with low-income citizens around the last affordable apartments.
In order to cover the demand for affordable apartments, every year 400,000 new units will have to be built by 2020.
To this end, a study is carried out on behalf of the union of the union of social housing construction.
To compare this year, there will be 260,000 units in Germany.
In this case there is a lack of 140.000 flats.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial reception.
Many people come up on the housing market and rows into long queues in front of the apartments.
According to the Statistical Office in the last year, however, less than half of all asylum seekers were living for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not just about the increase in the number of refugees.
The study also makes serious shortcomings in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is shooting a housing deficit that is growing from year to year.
At the moment, there are already around 77,000 accommodation units missing in the conurbations, and Matthias G√ºnther, author of the study complained.
Many professionals lived in WG's rooms in large cities.
Young adults continued to stay in the hotel mum because of the slowness in the housing market.
In major cities, the number of square meters per capita in recent years has now declined for the first time.
In order to solve the problem, the coalition forces social housing creation to restart.
In this context, new incentives are to restore social housing.
In this way, we would be able to do away with the tax on income tax, and the basic tax on subsidized housing should be suspended for a period of time.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive fiscal write-offs are needed.
The support program for refugee accommodation at the state bank KfW is already working well for cities and communities.
A good week after the start there was more than half of the EUR 300 million available on Monday evening with EUR 184 million.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free rein: Croatia and Slovenia have a corridor for a corridor.
After Hungary, there is virtually no sign, because more and more refugees are choosing the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant travel through Slovenia to the north without any obstacles.
However, it is dangerous to go down.
Croatia wishes to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
I have spoken with the Slovenian Minister for the Interior and, if necessary, we will organise a corridor, said the Croatian Home Affairs Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have been broken into Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television channels RTL.
Hungary had suspended its border for refugees on the previous day.
New laws that came into force on the same day, moreover, render proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually useless.
Croatia wants to pass the refugees on.
The Croatian prime minister, Zoran Milanovic, stated: You can travel through, and we are preparing for this possibility.
These people are there, they are women, children and men who live and want to achieve something.
However, they are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police carried out the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the EU's neighbour, Croatia, in the morning.
Most of them read from Syria, Iran, and Afghanistan.
They arrived both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk through the green border into Croatia.
The refugees, on the Croatian-Serbian border, are not facing border fences.
To this end, there are other dangers: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine spacers should now quickly create a safe passage.
After Hungary, after the closure of the border, there are hardly any more refugees.
On Tuesday the police counted 366 injured people.
Just before closing on Monday, there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws STUFAST act as a criminal offence to overcome and damage the border guards.
So, in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings have been initiated.
The sentenced is threatening prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 applications for asylum applications have been recorded on Tuesday in the new closed transeat units in Geneva, almost all of them - 93 - the most important of R√∂szke.
Among the applicants there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, there were still 40 refugees held there.
In practice, however, no one has any prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
After Hungary's view, Serbia is a safe country with third countries.
The asylum seekers who have been refused should be sent to it.
Prior to the transit zone in R√∂szke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In R√∂szke started working to clean up the workers.
They collected the garbage, leaving tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks on the road.
Gates have been removed, and one of the host camps in the border area has been rebuilt.
No one wanted to express an opinion on the aim of this transformation.
Austria can reach only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
For the 20,000 migrants, however, they still remained in the country.
In Salzburg, some 1400 people are waiting for you to travel to Germany.
Trains from there to Germany were stopped by German authorities in the morning.
In Freilassing, several smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot.
Mayors went on the side of the fence over the border
We were occupied after the bridge on Sunday with the room, when suddenly ten people with travel agents at the entrance of the tent stood up, so Wseriously one mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Due to the fact that, on Sunday, however, because of the influx of refugees, Germany unexpectedly stopped railway traffic with Austria was for them in Wernstein end, so Stadler, who immediately offered his help, and the Gesties, together with two other helpers, and their cars on the border in the middle of Passau.
Prior to that, we did the unexpected guests first, with frills and drinks.
We have said right now that we bring them to Passau with the car.
This, of course, was for us of course, so Stadler in the O√ñN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man was not allowed to take a generous donation - EUR 100 for the fire brigade.
This is what makes us very excited, so Stadler is.
The stranded train passengers went to Passau on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE into a regional train direction to Passau, to try, after the short-term notice, that rail traffic has been stopped by Germany, but still trying to do it over the border.
The regional train, however, was removed from the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein, the border is generally high across the board.
The bridge firmly union with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday sociable, day before a two-bridge run sports - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orb√°n is now sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the camp of R√∂szke immediately to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has been highly official and publicly placed the stance of the Hungarian Government in the Dark League of National Socialism.
It is not only those Austrians who are currently faced with chaotic conditions in border areas that are facing these policies.
They will also have to discover that the country that has been promised, invited and welcomed by the country, is nothing but another refugee camp.
ES will be a major challenge, in view of the constant flow of refugees and the approaching winter, in which we are able to produce humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be even more important - peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35.000 wintry floors.
Konrad has all the hands to do with the slaughter of refugees.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight.
The government has used the former mighty Raiffeisen-Banker to draw quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in Traiskirchen's first town hall Traiskirchen has already reached its grip.
We do not have any homeless people in Traiskirchen's, he told him about his first success.
Also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday was performed without a big fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational performance of a master performance.
The interior ministry, on the other hand, spoke of a crisis-ridden situation.
All in all, Konrad has a requirement of 85,000 floors in this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are intended to provide the countries, 15,000 the covenant.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But there is no bottomless pit," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the national councillors.
They would have given him a assurance that they would also be able to settle for the next refugees.
In Upper Austria it runs well, said Ferry Maier.
The former leader of the Party, Mandatar, supports Konrad.
There will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂nborn, however, in order to clarify how the Church will help.
High hopes will also put the asylum coordinator into the ORF action plan as we do.
On the platform, individuals can easily offer accommodation.
There is also a hope for hotels that end in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as a very high quality standard yesterday.
In emergency time, it is not possible for you have to keep a certain amount of the towel or the size of the upper floors.
For a temporary period, standard emergency standards would have to apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, he is motivated by his experience.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am an old man who is not even told to face the truth.
Persuasion is its main weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause costs to the republic as they themselves declared.
They want to increase your number to three to four.
The country's own travel arrangements, however, have not been successful so far.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as office.
However, there are obviously problems with authorisation.
Linz requires a Better Divide
For the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like Tips-Arena and Design Center for accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as one cannot, as a result, in the absence of these measures, as mayor Klaus Luger is known as SP.
For emergencies, however, other sites should be tested for their suitability.
Criticism of the city leader on the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts, too, must play their part here.
Seehofer: Fixed borders will not be sealed off
In a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister, Horst Seehofer's Head of State, Mr. Josef P√ºhringer gave birth to the issue of refugees on Monday.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders are not sealed.
The further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, it is precisely the border control that is now in place.
There will be no more with refugees coming to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking refuge would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
From the other EU member states, P√ºhringer once again called for more solidarity on the issue of refugees.
Now that Austria is once again introducing controls on its borders, it is a logical consequence for P√ºhringer's passage from the actions of the Germans.
The Next Runtastic is a question of Time
The general renovation of the new shipyard in the Linzer industrial line is officially closed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S & T has been collected, the rest is 2700 square meters intended to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
In IT, the smart brains are our raw material - and we must try to work for us, says S & T boss Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine to invest in start-up companies in the New shipyard and subsequently to acquire them.
From the very beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: The next Runtastic is only a matter of time.
EUR 3.3 million has been invested in the site by S & T, EUR 3.3 million from the TechCenter, which is one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Confederation of FFG.
The building is leased from Linz AG for 60 years to S & T and TechCenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of residual area in the building are already rented out, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni-owner opened second business in the arcade
In our new shop you will be at the touch of a wool handbag.
Actually Jutta Breit wanted to introduce a dog.
This project had to release the 49 year old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt-Arkade. After all, it has grown in the form of another business district.
In the Furla-Shop, sold to the shop in which they sell, among other things, bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes of different manufacturers, everything revolves around women's handbags from the Furla brand.
Bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, it was converted for several weeks.
However, I have long thought about whether or not I want to open a shop, says Breit.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were treated by the idea of a location on which only their handbags were sold.
We are the only ones in the largest city to sell this brand, says the mother of two daughters who have their own Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has brought her to her mother's cradle from her mother.
I like the most if something is being developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women at the sight of a nice handbag cannot answer with the last security.
Perhaps it is because a nice bag of each outfit adds up.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called givers.
This property connects some to the billionaire who wants to become the US president.
Donald Trump ¬Æ 69 is always good for burners.
Whether it is a matter of xenophobia, about journalists, or of knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency is stirring up the electoral campaign.
And cut well.
This is also registered in the Challian Kallstadt, where the grandparents" grandparents" grandparents come from.
The New Yorker with the conciliator is a concept in the Winzerdorf on the Wine Road.
Mancher in the 1200 resident place is related to him over -tens corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in election mode.
The vocal town of Simone Wendel shot a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about becoming the most powerful man in the world?
I believe that they find some exciting but not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter, says Simone Wendel.
The native Kalltown has shot a funny documentary about the town and its famous horse, which also includes Trump as well as the Heinz Ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known to be well known, comes to the hands of Kings of Kallstadt - 2014 - to say that he would also be successful if he were to live in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the king's heart.
True, there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tend to believe that Trump is already a bit of a great coat, says Wendel.
As a result, Brulljesmacher - the leader in the field - is said to be in German: The encoders, she says.
Trump is coming from the village of the giver.
The Trumpike success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated to the United States and opened a restaurant for gold graves.
The foundation of the real estate company was first real estate purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: Their desire to return to their homeland in the long run, failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate was owned at the time.
He did not capture Trump because he was once without authorisation, had declared the director of the Institute of Gaelic History and Folk, Roland Paul, on the launch of the film.
Trump is the cradle of an illegal emigrant.
This is in contrast to the remnants of the descendants at times.
It has repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
This is not so likeable as to say, Hans-Joachim Bender, who is a distant friend, the Oma was a born turmp, the opa was born Heinz.
The farmer's retirement looks more like the Americans, but he is always so salvaged.
Does he believe that Trump comes?
If I cannot imagine this, the 72-year-old tells me.
He never gave up with Kallstadt.
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentioned, as some Kallstadter said, that a descendant of the Heinz at a visit to the church organ, which is generally good at.
If that is what I cannot imagine by the Donald, the 68-year-old tells me.
It would be better if he did not cast the vote, because he who has such radical views, I do not know whether that is good.
If those who had said this in the US at the time of his grandfather would have been as he would have been, he would never have arrived there.
There are more interesting subjects than him, says Winzertochter Sarah B√ºhler.
And as President?
As far as I am concerned, Mr President, it is not the case that it says.
And: Die TRAUBEN will also be ready without the President Trump.
Wendels Film, for which Trump has been interviewed for long, has seen 12 000 kinogous, also in the US awakened to the interest.
The Upper Bavarian district of Ramsau at Berchtesgaden is Germany's first in the mountain auction village.
From the hands of the Vice-President at the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-Einsiedeln village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria, there are already 20 villages of mountain auction villages.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the prize.
A local mountain climber village must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its territory must be designated as a protected area.
Seven Years of Sunrise dominated the reviews, despite the attempts of Nine to take the loss of leadership at the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson took part in Canberra to post a loss of leadership from the liberals, but there have been no major shifts in ratings for Today.
The book show from Nine was broadcast by the German capital as Malcolm Turnbull managed to defeat Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, sat in London as part of a week series of international television broadcasts including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the event did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 spectators at the five capital cities, compared to that score 339,000.
Today, a slight increase over the ratings for Monday was 317,000, and last Tuesday's level was 283,000, but his number remained behind the 343,000 items that took place last Thursday.
In recent months, the gap between Sunrise and Sunrise has been closed.
In August there were 318,000, on average, compared to the 330.000 from Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise is 314,000, on average, 314,000 spectators.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are in order, thank you for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial station of packaged to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently announced father, who decides to live on the coast of New Zealand with his two children, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson could wear a Hitler show solo without the Rafter Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear 'yes' vote.

Hot-Seat average 620,000.

The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minutes that failed to make the McGuires Show superfluous.

The last three are right: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; &
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski have perhaps unwittingly seen who wins The Bachelor's.
The woman, in which Sam Wood eventually lands in The Bachelor, was wrapped up in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three still remaining girls will not be forgiven for being the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before coming out of three two, you might inadvertently have seen who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed off until the final on Thursday.
All three women have disfigured in lyrical ways about why wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as the reason why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, if not you who should receive Woods last rose, who would win the heart of the bachelor's, could be their responses to the playwright.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both quickly - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day.
From the moment when I went to the house and noticed Sarahs" Sams and Sams" energies, I felt that they were rather compatible, and I thought this throughout the course of the show, said Jeavons-Fellows.
With both feet of Sarah with both feet on the earth, it is so much fun to be with her, Markoski added.
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she would be good for Sam Wood as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made it clear that wood could be the One thing to be.
As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this apparently is not just a game - I am now unconditional for him, he said.
And when she was asked to choose who to choose wood, if not her, she was puzzling.
I do not know if I can say that, she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it is an undecided between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is aired on Wednesday, 19: 30, on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NML career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent questions at the end of last year after its impressive open training day.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and Trainer Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne for the rest of the game to the bench when he lost a war like the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Convertit at his first Punt-Return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula confided to his man, and gave Hayne the next opportunity to be a Punt-Return and also in the current game for a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his real face in the changing room after the match.
Instead of cutting off his Rookies in front of the rest of the team by the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula strengthened Hayne in his press conference as well.
The 49ers Sportreporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey who advised him to forget his pattured fishing and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is patching at a Punt that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings.
ES was certainly not the start, the Hayne and his massive Australian confession for his NFL-debut.
Hayne left after the fumble fluoriing the field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1, that he cannot expect a worse start to his NFL-career.
This was a thing that is happening now, you only care about the next game, and that's it, he said Hayne.
Hayne compared the carving with his Origin debut in 2007, when a pass in his own position area led to a Try of Queensland.
Overall, however, it was a great experience for the 27-year olds.
Hayne gave a picture for a photo with fans and keeps an Australian flag after the game and post it on his instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin met to discuss rights of gay prisoners
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested in a Siberian field by armed force.
Having challenged President Vladimir Putin openly, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company seized Yukos and stopped his democratic efforts.
The Free electorate, because of the high numbers of refugees, is asking for the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria.
Party and group chief judge, Hubert Aiwanger, warned at the beginning of the FW-Autumn in Wallstadt before a severe crisis at Bayer's schools, if there is no such new teacher for the many new pupils: We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of collapse, said Aiwanger.
Otherwise we shall have a breakdown in the Bavarian education system.
The outdoor party meeting of the Free electorate meets to Friday in the Lower Franconian community.
There were quite a number of other major issues that were supposed to be done.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the free voter meeting.
Of course, the subject of asylum is transferred to the Klausur, said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in the same way as they existed during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990's.
No longer, we have to go to the causes of it, said the free voter leader.

But they do not go far enough.
The topic G9 must be speeded up, said the Fed chairman.
We demand freedom of choice for all Gymnasia countries that want it.
Free driving on the G9 anywhere you want.

4 People killed after police rubber clips to shoot demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police attacked the rubber-woman in a crowd of skills that demonstrated against the proposed new Constitution, said a civil servant on Wednesday.
The assault was broken down on Tuesday evening in the Rupralhi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Evnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators have gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before they took back on rubber floors.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
Not immediately was it clear why the hardships used by those who are known to be able to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less repulsive alternative, seem to have produced such a high death rate.
The argument was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflict since 10.
In August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been governed centrally in Nepal for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on track since 2008, but legislators speeded up the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators have voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction site in the city planned
The property at the Old Post Office is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square metre area.
Planned is a mixture of commerce, commerce and living - but there are no special offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market an approx. 4,000 square meters in a direct neighborhood to the old post youth centre.
Preparations are ongoing for this.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of commerce, trade and living.
They are waiting for corresponding offers, that is to say from the city.
The question of an investor, however, is not yet clear.
As a result, no contracts have been signed either.
The city of Emden had bought a part of the land that was on the ring road/corner big road, bought more than a few months ago and allowed the building to be demolished.
Project HIEVE: Details are available on the table.
Plans for a holiday settlement on the small seas at Emden take shape.
The investor filed for the project public plans for the project for the first time.
Many of them are still more concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure time.
Months for months behind closed doors, was held, debated, debated and drawn.
Now there are the plans for a new holiday village settlement on the small seaside close to Emden on the table.
The prospective client, the SME Emder company, was founded by the System-Bau Group on Monday evening in the Council's Committee on Development and Cooperation in the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
Originally, this point had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the Project Critics and the FDP Group, which preached the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went on to the offensive: We have not yet answered all questions about an answer, he said to the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumours now.
The projects around ten to twelve million euros have been in discussion for months.

Mr Schulz, the landlord owner and a member of the Board of Directors in the representation of the interests of the Anliegers, Pro HIEVE, claims: "This will be a giant clotry that will surprise all the others.
He is also afraid, like many other critics of the project, that traffic is likely to increase by the intended size of the plant.
What exactly is happening on the estate of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is not yet an operator.
First of all we have to have a coherent concept available, said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans are still variable.
Twin boys at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to seeing you at its Gorillas.
The 26 year old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years old, and in 1967 it was also in Frankfurt, from the zoo.
The sex of the newborn Gorilla twins have not been fixed yet, as mother Dian has so far kept them close to the body.
First, the picture was published.
NHC says a 60-percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center called on Tuesday a wide low pressure system about 350 miles to the south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands, which has a 60% chance of developing a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
A further clearly defined low pressure system, such as in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60-percent potential to form a tropical hurricane in the next two days, adding the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google is launching a doubling campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. announced a doubling of the $11 million in humanitarian organizations that would help the thousands of refugees who have overtaken the European nations, fleeing from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach when posting the donor's call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud wrote a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, about her personal experience.
Our trip consisted of many dark rail and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear, they wrote.
I was lucky.
However, as the refugee and migration crisis has grown in Europe, many people, such as my family, are desperately looking for help.
Donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global contributions, up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com, have doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing from the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes will last at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
A long time in order to show something to show mortality data, said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the magens.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity has proven to be effective over the years to deal with type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been carried out on people who are obese with a body-mass index of 35 or higher.
BMI, a degree of weight in size, is considered to be normal between 18,5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov employed 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach and stomach sound - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes among people who have been slightly overweight.
The average BMI below those subjected to this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Under this rule, BMI remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29.
In those who have undergone surgery, 36% of diabetes has been able to complete the Diabetes disease in full and in part with 28%.
In the medication-treated group, in comparison with diabetes, only 1%, sometimes only, were only about two per cent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, the triglyceride and the low malignant LDL cholesterol in general, more generally in the group surgical group, the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood mirror of hemoglobin in A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels over time.
Hamoglobin A1c is thought to be the best less than 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, average hemoglobin A1c fell to around 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapist, however, it remained stable at around 8 percent.
But this improvement in Glycemic Control - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin in A1c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years, so the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The Research team compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypate surgeon in comparison with the Gastrektomy Group had lost weight loss of 18,7 versus 14.2 kg, and larger declines in BMI totaled 7.4 against 5.1 and 46.9% vs. 2.1%, and recorded more a complete resolution of diabetes up to 46.9% versus 16.7%.
While the new study has not shown a survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of hard-working people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was in the case of obese people who are undergoing an obesity operation, about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - in comparison with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not offer an advantage for the survival of the surgeon patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group, without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30.
I think that we wait too long to get people to take this seriously, he said.
I think that as soon as they have collected these genetic changes that have fixed their bodies with obesity and diabetes, it is really hard to reverse.
Love History is playing in the Hunsr√ºck.
It is an issue that is becoming increasingly important in the Belletristic: A young woman, too late at school, is unpopular and unsightly, after years she retreats her youth, and this falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel in fact, we are not so created by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel is likely to be interesting for Hunsr√ºck readers as he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding towns.
The professional author grew up in Langweiler and is delighted that she has been able to place a literary monument in her home town.
It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT-News.
Europe cannot catch all the refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution is to the refugee crisis in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the violence in the countries' countries to be brought to an end.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of individual nations, or even continents, in the circumstances.
He also pointed out that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable but not appropriate.
It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe, he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria lobbied his efforts in overcoming the crisis, he pointed out that it is only a temporary solution.
To take care of several thousands of refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you have to think about long term solutions, such as a true peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries can be created, he emphasized.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The application of violence never resolved these problems, he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of violence and said George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September, pointing out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to resolve this problem lies in non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force, and this has caused unexpected consequences, said the Dalai Lama.
Four times the increase in consumption of adventitious infections caused by children in the past 4 years
Toxic control centres in the United States report on an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under twelve, who swallow strong alcoholic hand infections, such as the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, the case of income of hand disinfection agents in children under 12 years of reporting the toxic control centres, from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
Children come more and more frequently to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them landed in the emergency call, said Lopez CNN.
He said there are some children disinfectant deliberately drinking, while some people do to impress their friends or because of a sample in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people are disinfectant only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have used allegedly disinfectant with alcoholic juice to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive jets of disinfectant.
A child does not think that it is bad for it, said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive weld disinfectants are those that are paraffin.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapes and oranges that are very appealing to children.
Flushing agents contain somewhere between 45 and 95% alcohol.
Especially in the case of small children, a few injections can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol content, told Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison notrufcenter in the hospital of the University of Kansas, the station Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you do not leave a sip of whisky, but people do not allow this kind of disinfectant in reach of children, and when children come to this, it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently took four injection from after strawberry scam in the school, was brought into an emergency.
Your blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold imposed by an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency physician, treated in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah lallte her words and was not able to go when they arrived at the emergency.
Doctors supervised them overnight in a separate child hospital on signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and came head, said Ritchey.
This was very scary, said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and to store suspended disinfectant outside the scope of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, there were some disinfectants associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing the infection with a toxic, non-declared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a killing solution, instead of ethyl alcohol used as the active ingredient.
In January, planned three students of the fourth class in New York City to poison her as a teacher in her life by placing antibacterial products around the classroom, thus reporting it a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic against hang-disinfectants and rendered them out of their room.
The police looked at the patchy plan as a sign of history and pointed disciplinary measures to the school authority.

The lack of title competition in Scotland's soccer boring Dutchman - de Boer
The former Ranger-Middle Field player and former national player of the Netherlands, Ronald de Boer, said that Dutch soccer fans lost interest in Celtic, there is no title race with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: In Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why?

We really need the support of Celtic because that makes the player better.
To get together now is so important.
Warburton careful in January transfers

The players coming in summer have this pre-saison-time to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.

Why I am witnessing a execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I shall see to it that one man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will sit in a gallery gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison spritze.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January on his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day came closer, I started to fear myself.
So why should I do it?
I voted because I thought it would be a good way of telling the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists must be able to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabere lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five.
Anyone who will be chosen will watch it unscathed.
I cannot.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossips closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so it will not be permitted me to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I must simply try to remind me of all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you get access.
I remember it with her.
She acknowledged that she could have better formulate her, but she still thinks it is wrong to what I do.
Richard Glossip had difficulty with some of the things I said and written.
He does not tell me what to write, and I would not do it even if he would do it.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks it will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I made.
I do not want to go into all the details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the assassination of Barry Van Treese would owe him to be a beneficiary of the deed.
But I believe there is a strong probability that it is not guilty of murder.
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I shall see him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact for.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death.
He was forced to flee from the Canning River to flee the River Canning River.
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he overcame the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a guy from Perth to hang up the police proved unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and marshy water, just a few meters from a police officer who tried to persuade him to go back to the shore and return to the shore.
The police of Canning Vale were called in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of Canning River.
But he did not get too far.
He was in the water and said I can't come out, come and get me, said Senior Holder Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet, so he used a more reliable tactic - A good police officer is negotiating.
Sometimes, people do funny things to try to escape, said Senior Holder Castledine.
Championship football players Ben Couirs offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins went to the ditch to escape from alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy him and are threatening to end racing sports.
Peter Moody claims that stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He was inspired by the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she passed a personal campaign against him with the late smoothing of Lady Tatai for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt sample of Lidaris that he could not explain.
He had held back for 18 months for the espionage allegations and did not want it to look like too high hanging TRAUBEN.
I did not want to say anything about it, and I listened for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything is coming out, said Moody.
You know that it went on.
Sometimes we react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home this evening and sleep well.
I want to walk around my head and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them.
If they begin to think, I do not do so, then I should not be more coach.
I have to consider what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody had run the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department tried to spy on its stable.
Over eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I am called to appoint if I was asked - and offered him a job in my stables to deliver information about what I do in my stables, Moody at Racing.com said.
You seem to believe me that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should surely find their nases, because they have failed in trying to be able to do so.
Robert Roulette, Chairman of the RVL, David Mooden, President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this and still are today.
Should I believe that it is personal?
Has the RVL been cowardly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there that I am it.
Perhaps they have to take them out of my licence and do so, and I have no doubt that what I am saying now gives them pause for thought.
But I have arrived now at the point in which I do not care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to take a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The Frustration levels of the trainer have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation by Lidari, and the late scratching was that he said he could throw his license on the table.
Moody, who is best known by his preparation for the unbeaten master Black Caviar, called the race treatment rule becoming ridiculous after a pack of mud or clay has been applied to the horse debuted, contrary to the rules.
It is against the rules of racing.
I must assume full responsibility for that, he said.
When I was a member of my team, I immediately applied mud to the leg.
It could have been that way yesterday evening.
It would have been possible yesterday all day, which was the case.
However, it also did so on the day of the race.
It could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the package on the day of the race, and an investigation into this matter has been opened.
It is a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
As we all see, we need rules, but here we have gone too far, said Moody.
Man After Driver Disclosure
At the weekend, the police arrested a man after a clash with a cyclist and followed driver flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was captured with the helicopter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after it was hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Murray-Valley-highway.
The police said that motorists continued to stop in order to help the injured driver.
On Monday there was a 50 year old man from Nathalia the police in Shepparton.
It is likely to be charged for driver's flight and failing to provide help and for other types of traffic.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in hospital, located in a stable condition.
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy beats against rivals for allegations of ring fighting back
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy has called a critique of his players as an agent setting by two Premier League favourites of NRL.
Sydney Rooster Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referee allowed the storm-players to be able to compete with his team during the high storm event in Sydney on Friday evening.
Susanne's trainer, Wayne Bennett, made a brief comment on the Storm-Team after his team achieved the Final-Sieg against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, as he called the game a model example of the rugby league and said that the two of Queensland do not seem to be too good to do with the two of Queensland.
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his crew and said that they were only concentrated on their contact with Tackling on their contact.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team him confident since it means that they were concerned to be beaten by the Storm Team.
As I have never heard - I did not hear that Trent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they met us 24: 2, said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have changed nothing on our defensive system or the techniques, but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with Taclian a real priority, and that has been done for us.
Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team, so he is probably not accustomed to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is funny how this is going on in this season.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of exciting soccer ball and reminded his mentor that Bennett St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with the longest-running football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He went on his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting her game was, said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he will take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like them.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things, because they are somewhat concerned to play against us.
Six weeks ago they did not think of us when it came to big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the play Broncos against cowboys.
The play of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two other tests at our game, but is this an exciting game?
Are there any breaks, there are no points to make any difference?
For me, it is the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will come to them at a stage.
The Storm-Team released this weekend free since they have won the right, either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks to receive the next Saturday evening at the AAMI Park, and ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning.
With $200,000 in cash on drugs?
A man who may be threatened by his trial to come in possession of 40 kg of cocaine, which has been smuggled into Queensland, has been released against a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of droge on the yacht Solay, which came to South America through Vanuatu and in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was seen as he met his fellow prisoners in the Marina during the morning and later at Caf√© Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drow in a Toyota echo.
Despite a potential sentence for trying to hold a commercial mass of cocaine, the lawyer's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to have the whole amount and that in the cafe could be a harmless cause.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter flanking, was concerned about the threat of death in Maksimovic.
He has a clear relationship with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, he said to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as a security together to secure his release.
After reading the explanations of the two people, it is clear that the requirement for a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden, said Judge Fagan.
But this alone is not enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he passes his Australian and Serbian passport, to the police every day and stick to an exit from 18: 00-06: 00.

There was a complete breakdown of the driver's house.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe has been completely closed for 6 hours to 2 pm.
The result was a loss of 122,000 euros.
At Hogg used children's phone to entice paedophiles to send images.
A paedophile used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse.
At Hogg, the girl took up the girl's phone when she slept, log in to an online messaging service, from which he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of that and saw the five images, analyzed computers that had been found at the site and discovered the search for indecent web searches that were used for searching for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg claimed then to the civil servants that he did it, because it would lead to cyber paedophiles on the Internet, and then he gave up a policeman to be a policeman to frighten them.
The Attorney Eilidh Robertson said the Dundee Sheriff Court: He said he would be looking for him to frighten people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer from him, but he said that it was events because he wanted to claim a policeman to frighten paedophiles.
He was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said that he did it to entice them.
He said he was sick in his head if he was drinking, he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: If the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was crying and crying.
She also saw the indecent images on the phone and confrontational the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who saw a lot of young people.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment, indecent images of children on 14 June last year, and not to be held in court for a hearing to be held on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg does not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one might argue that there is no significant sexual element to be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael put judgment to October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody due to hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was admitted to the list of sexual criminals prior to the date of the ruling.
Barriers at small border crossing points from Germany to Germany
More and more refugees are taken on the edge of the major control points at the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers, fearful of discovery and arrest, caused people more at smaller border crossings
On the Austrian side, said a spokesman of the Federal Police.
Along the border flows, Passau and Rottal-Inn have been picked up for more than 1,000 refugees since Tuesday.
They were able to walk through bridges and dams to the German side.
There, they are picked up by federal police officers and forwarded to them for registration.
At the Munich Hauptbahnhof, in accordance with federal police data, more refugees were once again in comparison with the week beginning on Wednesday.
Until 8: 00 a.m. had about 700 people in the capital city, said a speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, the city had reached the city on Tuesday, 1759.
Stuttgart: Scouts of tropical storm in the south west of Henry South awaits.
Meteorologists warn against storms in the south-west of Wednesday afternoon.
As a result of a deep pressure zone over Western Europe, the warm sea air in the country, the German weather service, passed through DWD's office in Stuttgart, Germany.
The strong deep that the tropical storm, Henry, has been drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic over the past few days.
Yeast storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in swimming.
According to DWD, it is still until Thursday morning at the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and on the seacoast with B√∂ts from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour.
On Friday, the sun shines again.
The crowd turns out: Every two years, the car manufacturers show their novelties at the IAA.
In 2015, it is particularly the movement of the compact cars that are currently selling very well.
Cars from the compact class are at the moment in particular: Around 28.1 per cent of the new registrations came to this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected on the IAA for publication from 17 to 27 September.
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest prefixes for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at dealers in the autumn.
The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It is part of the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra will not become much more expensive.
Opel offers an entry level below the largest competitor VW Golf in view, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs at the age of 16 990.
The Astra is equipped with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW at 100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offer more diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW at 95 hp up to 147 kWstills 200 hp, for the first time also include three-cylinder tanks.
Unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only available as a fifth spear.
The second variant will be followed in the spring of the Kombi, which will also be seen at the IAA.
What will happen next to the Astra at the IAA?
Renault M√©gane: Renault sends the Vten generation of its Astra-competitor M√©gane to the race.
At the fair, the M√©gane can be seen exclusively as a 5 star in a conventional and an emphasis on Sport GT version.
In trade it comes to the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: Very new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti adapts perfectly with its curved lines into the brand's design line.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW at least 122 hp.
There is also a diesel with 80 kW of 109 hp or 125 kW at 170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
There is a model with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0liter turbomengine and a power of 82 kW powered 111 hp.
The maximum torque is based on the manufacturer's specifications at 170 Newtonmeters.
The launch of the Baleno in Europe will be in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new but completely renewed, the compact model DS 4 is to be seen at the IAA.
On the other hand, the designer of the noble Citro√´n-Ablegers especially drew his attention to the front line: Here the radiator was redrawn and the changed headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and it was then integrated for the first time.
In addition, there are a number of revisions and new versions of the IAA in the compact class, such as the frozen Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cells are inhumane.
The Federal Constitutional Court granted permission to a former prisoner of the City of Tegel, which was set up for months in a small cell.
In principle, because of the violation of their human dignity, detainees are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the judges can even hope for money if they have been locked up in too few days in the excessively crowded rooms: 1 BvR 1127 on 14.
As a result, an ex-prisoner with his constitutional record in Karlsruhe was successful: He was housed in a single cell with around five square meters of ground in a single cell between June and November 2009.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, was once again on his feet, was moved to a larger cell.
He failed to do so because of the disgraceful prison conditions against the country of Berlin.
But the constitutional judges made the judgment of the Berlin Court of Justice and meadows the case for re-examination there.
They respect the human dignity of the man.
Chamber Court is now deciding to pay compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, there were only a few days of compensation for compensation from the period in question, there was a remedy.
Otherwise, it would be a cause for fear of the legal protection of personality.
The chamber court must now clarify the amount of cash.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
Only in April were they to claim damages for them because he was naked in a cell.
To be unworthy, a decision of 2011 is also to be the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet.
In addition, the Berlin Constitutional Court confirmed that a prisoner in a parallel case, confirmed in November 2009, also confirmed a dignified accommodation for a prisoner in a parallel case.
The then plaintiff was accommodated between 15 to 21 hours daily from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
In recent weeks, the Berlin prisons have also been in the headlines due to missing staff.
Prisoners are now surrounded by 23 hours, and the aggressiveness is rising, even in the case of the tense situation.
According to information from the court of justice, 21 positions are not occupied in Tegel because of the shortage of young people, 19 are to be lost in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: We create the ground
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to adopt it.
What is going on in Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year, around 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany this year, according to Deputy Prime Minister Sigmar Gabriel's Social Democratic Party, Germany is even able to take up a million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's Chancellor Angela Merkel has shown determination in the face of the unusual challenge: I say again and again: We can do it and we will create it.
What matters to Germany gives the following overview.
According to a wide variety of forecasts, between 350000 and the estimate by the Federal Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of Education and the 400000 based on the estimate by the Pestel Institute for a year - it is the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built to include 250000 apartments.
The reason for this is the lack of housing, especially in terms of affordable housing: Between 60000 and 80000 social housing estates from rental prices, and in these attractive apartments will also apply for refugees.
Federal Ministry for Development, Barbara Hendricks's Social Democratic Party, wants to double the funding, from now EUR 518 million to EUR 1 billion.
Far too little is done from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing groups would have to emerge annually, and that would require the Federal Government to invest at a level of 6.4 billion a year.
The fact is that both scientists and the Federal Ministry of the Development agree that there must also be more fiscal advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute of labour market and professional research, it can be assumed that in the long term, 55 percent of birds can be employed in Germany.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be required systematically for their qualifications to help them join, criticise Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration scientist Dietrich Thr√§nhardt.
There is a political change in Germany, according to the Thr√§nhardt: From the ban on working for refugees in recognition of work.
Whereas there was a temporary ban on asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as is the residency duty that restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, not least because of the shortage of skilled workers, the view prevailed on the majority of the view that refugees should be made more quickly possible to access the labour market.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of German.
So far there is not yet a sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are mostly mediated by personal contacts.
The building of networks is, therefore, of Thr√§nhardt the royal road to working integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few forced parents were able to give their children to the kitan, estimated at ten to 15 percent: For the disabled parents it is very important to keep the family together, says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
To persuade the family to convince by the advantages of Kita, the administration handles handslips in several languages.
If the need for educators to rise significantly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example, by allowing more specialist schools.
Students in the countries are prepared for the teaching without German proficiency in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers, but as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as the second language.
To them there is no shortage, says Beate Stbids from Berlin school management.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that around 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In general, no federal state prohibited asylum seekers or students - the only exception was Berlin, Interior senator Frank Henkel, the Christian Democratic Party, but now abandoned his position.
Student willing refugees could be relieved of access to the college.
Because refugees with a residence permit or toleration do not receive any benefits under the asylum application law when they start their studies.
In principle, they do not have a BAf√∂G, as they do not fall below the group of eligible persons.
For four years now, displaced persons have had to have lived in Germany to be able to be Baf√∂g-entitled, from 1 January 2016 to reduce their span to 15 months.
However, the funding gap must be closed down, demanding Steffen krach, Berlin's Secretary of State for Science, and the German Studentenwerk.
The students should receive BAf√∂G immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually give Islam the same rights as the churches have, and to further develop the existing state church to a new state relationship.
It would also be important for the establishment of an Islamic welfare organisation, which takes care of the newcomers in a professional manner.
The rights also include duties.
For example, the representatives of Islam must be able to agree on a clear point of contact and be prepared to cooperate with the Member States in a number of areas and to give them a certain amount of control.
This includes the willingness to fight against religious fundamentalism.
The chair of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wish to do such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to be here in Germany, in Germany, turned off, he said in Bayrian radio.
He proposed to translate the constitution into Arabic.
In future, integration will be much more than a matter for society as a whole today.
In this way, the majority society will have to change, so the removal of discrimination and racism will be more pressing.
Although, as a result of European choices, Germany has been an anti-discrimination body for a decade and a general equality law.
But it is learning very slowly, as the Nazi assassination line showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrants' organizations and non-white German interest groups have been demanding for a long time, and for which international agreements such as the anti-racism Convention Germany are committed, must become a reality in the years to come when the country is going to stay peaceful and make use of its new citizens - to the best of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees so far, according to doctors" president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
As far as man- power and capacities are concerned, we make the living, he said to the day mirror.
However, additional money would need to be put into the system for this.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery is calling for all drivers to hand over their health cards at the same time.
Services could subsequently be settled with the federal states.
And, in the long run, it is highly questionable to send out so many people with the limited service catalogue that the asylum seeker law provides.
Otherwise, doctors will especially create language barriers.
Until now, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proved that migrants are getting worse off their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in doctors' practices, they are asking for interpretation costs.
It would also be helpful for many refugees, as well as more general medical contact centres in the field of emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic view.
For example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities in refugee camps, and in the case of young people it is about HIV awareness.
As a result, Montgomery was able to learn from her training, but he believed that he was in charge of her training.
It is not so difficult to identify parasite cases or tuberculosis, and as far as the shortage of health is concerned, perhaps even relief from the refugees.
The Syrians would have a sophisticated education system, and many refugees are even doctors.
To practice, however, they need to be able to prove their qualifications and may even carry out audits.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany, according to estimates by the German Federal Patent Association, are mentally ill: Most suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
The most vulnerable are refugee children," explains Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK.
A recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children is traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder are suffering from, among other things, flashbacks with breathing, fraud, heart attack, and death fears.
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong nervousness and emotional blindness.
To prevent symptoms from chronic, be early treatment necessary, Munz explained.
Until now, however, only four per cent of the mentally ill received a psychotherapy.
While mentally ill can put asylum seekers into a psychotherapy program in the social courts, it usually takes several months.
Moreover, in social councils, practitioners or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misjudgments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to Dream
With the new staging of passion, Circus Probst returns to the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating acrobatics, pet dressage and passive entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to the manege on the brick and brick.
Our passion is the circus.
I cannot imagine, without living my circus family, says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior director.
Passion for passion - this is the motto of the current management stage.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family Probst.
So the gift to the family is in the blood.
It is important to us that it is important to pull away people from their everyday lives and to take them for two hours to a completely different world, emphasizing the 27-year-old junior chef.
If you want to have a cocktail with a world city flair, director Reinhard Probst is called a concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 km long tour can experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded to the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family pulls the audience with laughter and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of silent movies, the Cuban duo wants to easily absorb them.
Lightness and agility - these words they identify with these words.
Your humorous art at the mast is intended to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with a sense of flair and spirit.
With the one wheel on a ball?
The yuan is not a problem.
If you want to see it, you will be able to see it at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little else and fascinates with her agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect.
The animals belong to our family, Stephen's mother, Brigitte Probst, is a member of the family.
Abuses in the posture of circuses are all too often a matter of different animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes part in this: We do not think it is good for our animals, neither is it good for us.
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The four-legged artists, as they are affectionately called, will be taken away from the eyes after the possibility of each wish.
We want to work with animals and have fun with them.
If the animal is not sure, it does not want to be in the manege.
So the most important thing, then: Good for the animals.
The Probst family is proud of her zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Ponyhengst and a zebra.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
Then, suddenly, suddenly, our little Jumbo da ruby, tells Brigitte Probst.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So for every visitor it is likely to be something.
Certainly One is sure to be true, says Stephanie Probst: Oral Egal ob five or 1 200 spectators, we always do our best and are wholeheartedly in the process of doing so.
The Circus Probst invites you from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 20 o'clock.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16: 00 pm.
Thursday is a family day, for the presentation at 5 pm prices are reduced.
It is also open daily from 10: 00 to 18: 00.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe's speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained silent, but the video of the case quickly spread through the social media.
Parliament's opening was also tarnished by allegations by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them that Mr Mugabe would be contacted by Mr Mugabe.
Last month, they ran out of it and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he reiterated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change of Movement for Democratic Change - MDC, known as the Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them of disrupting Mr Mugabe's speech.
The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title of death ', he told journalists of Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that the immunity of Parliament ends and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesperson said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about the dangers to politicians.
Up to 30,000 jobs are expected to be cleared up by up to 30,000 jobs?
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the restructuring and savings effort in the company's services.
HP will be divided into two listed listed companies this year and that the computer and print shop will be separated from its fast-growing business hardware and its services business.
The expected job cut reduces more than $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
These restructuring measures will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise enabled," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, which is responsible for the unit after the separation.
While Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of shops supporting businesses in switching to a new style of business, Whitman said.
As an independent company we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers all over the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise spent more than $50 billion, with $annual turnover and more focused on supplying previously unreached, integrated technology solutions for businesses, such as a statement by the company.
ES zerates a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electric installations and their Palo Alto garage man named the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has undergone massive restructuring in order to break away from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action taken by HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US biotechnology companies, is the latest in this area, based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform a better performance.
FC Arsenale Captain Mikel Arteta says that team mates are standing behind the injured Jack Wilshere against Dynamo Zagreb.
Wenger emphasized to Wilshere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation follows plan, there is no reason why he cannot play back before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss the next four games for England and, in view of his story, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame on this current problem is that Wilshere finished the last season after a separate ankle injury, and then returned to his old ride during the pre-season.
This type of injury does not threaten the career, said Wenger.
ES is a bone that did not heal well.
That is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
ES was not in combination with his ankles or the injuries he had before had.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return to the season.
ES is also developing an uncomfortable pattern.
The study by Premier Insua Ltd recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of arsenals in 157 matches in the last five matches.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight games since 2007. These are the most vulnerable days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
Sometimes, when you return from injury, you have a time in which you can strengthen your body and win battle power, said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilises, I am confident he will do it and will go through a career that he deserves.
He starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
H√©ctor Beller√≠n and Aaron Ramsey did not go to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud, instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
I try to keep the balance and to give the players who need a quick break, said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is clear, through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating effects in Europe.
Dynamo is also after 41 games undefeated after the undefeated bar campaign campaign started in the last season.
The stadium was hit by an earthquake on Tuesday evening at the Richter scale 3.2.
This year was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco and is driven away from the distant hope that his management will lead the association to its first Europapokal-triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked with Arsenal yet.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not a dreamer.
FriendsFest: The comedy show, which gives us serious lessons on men's friendly friendships.
The absence of similar representations in shows is obviously more desperate than ever, especially in view of the need for men to open, even more desperate than ever before, such as suicides among young men on a 15-year anniversary.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death among men at the age of 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Foot Living abate CALM - campaign against a miserable life of 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from looking for help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study on more than 2,000 high school pupils with depressive symptoms found that if the body had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with healthy mood, its chances of recovery were doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work.
In the age of communication on social media, with their emphasis on style on substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong, funny and successful, even if in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extra-territorial values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that has a much deeper effect on our mental health.
And like a videogame inventor and billionaire recently explained that money can really not buy luck.
The beautiful thing about Friends was that this focus was turned on the head.
Every character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which was shining through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and chandlers frequent hugs, moments at soccer watching in cosy armchairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can come to this in any case, even if they are often reluctant to explore fully their feelings.
As a member of the telephone company told me, it is really clear to me that the role of people who feel depressed and suicidal for people who feel they are suicidal and that they are self-defeating can make a difference to me how even the little interactions of your friends can make a difference.
The men who contact us feel they are often unable to speak with friends.
The old saying of the word that I can do, rightly, has a powerful effect on how to feel that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term resolution mechanisms.
It presents clearly the small moments of men's friendly acquaintances.
So much my objective outsider status via the phone may help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of families and friends.
And so if you visit this weekend comedy Central FriendsFest with the backdrop to the celebration of the day, why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better if you are sitting alone in Starbucks someone sitting alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know which difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be sent to comedy Central from start to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest.
Maria meets in order to help PSG to crush Malm√∂.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani on his match against Malm√∂.
Maria meets on Tuesday at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to get in touch with Malm√∂.
Here are the game reports and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held the course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malm√∂ in the Congress park stadium on Tuesday.
Maria met in less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PSG player who launched the French champion, but afterwards they missed a series of opportunities before they finally increased their lead, as Cavani scored a headball in the 61 minutes.
With Real Madrid and Schhaljor Donetsk also in A need Paris a strong start against Swedish champions, as they not only seek the qualification for the K.O.-times, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-final in each of the last three campaigns.
But, while they got the points, it was not a match of Laurent Blancs's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate, and he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association that began his illustrious career as long ago as 1999.
It is not easy to win at home or compete in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2: 0, to make our opponents cause problems and look back, even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season, said Blanc, said Blanc.
This is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not achieved one or two other goals.
As a result of his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team, he returned to the Paris team, which at the weekend was able to hold a 2: 2 in his place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was killed in the fourth minute by Di Mary.
The Argentine wing tower was called the man who could take the PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month of Manchester United, and he intimated to why he ran into the long edge of the network in Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Brewing Defense, before going round the long edge of the network.
But if anyone believed that PSG would win a great victory, it was disappointed.
Malm√∂, who proposed the Celtic in a playoff to reach this stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was a serious opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field.
But, apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed away at Kevin Tracke posts in the 34.
Stattdem gave rise to PSG itself, not least in terms of a number of failures and poor qualifications, not least in the case of Ibrahim himovic, who, in no less than five experiments, was only patched in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani tried to do it after the reboot.
However, he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Redehimovic who turned the Di Maria into a rotating shot, which was taken by Wiland in the 52 minute at the end of the post.
The second gate was finally soon after the end of the triathlon, thanks to Cavani.
This ended all the thoughts that Malm√∂ could come into play, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland, from the very short distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the final result low before any replacement player, Ezequiel Lavezzi, was able to escape a gate at the end.
The coach of Malm√∂, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team and the Norwegians said: "Our last championship league game was last December.
We have played only in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough.
Wake Up to Paris!
ES was a great game from them!

Xavi: PEP Guardiola avoided switching to FC Bayern in 2008.
World and European champion Xavi is playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
The FC Bayern appeared a few years ago in front of the commitment made by Spain's star Xavi, which was then played for the FC Barcelona.
Beware Spanish Masters, three times Pocalwinner, four times Champions League winner, two times championship champion champion, two times champion champion, a World Champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer he left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club after Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi is now telling us that he was going to the EM 2008 before leaving Barcelona.
Yesterday I was told that Barca wanted to sell me.
At the time Madrid won everything, we did nothing about it, he told.
And the registered version of the FC Bayern.
Xavi: There was an offer from Bavaria.
What did you want to see?
As a reminder: In the summer of 2008, J√ºrgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not move
However, the change did not come about.
And the crucial man today is working for the German record champion: PEP Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: Broken Barca has taken Guardiola under contract and I have played a great EM.
Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he could not imagine the team without me.
He managed to do that, and he got me down.
Who knows how Bayern Season 2008 was running in 2009 with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance from the grass, divided the Red from 4: 0, 1: 1, and, in the end, celebrated the royal class triumph.
Matt Damon will record diversity in the movie scene.
Matt Damon confronted the afroamerican filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes.
As a result of Sunday Night by HBOS Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown collapsed as she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, in relation to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
If we talk about diversity, then do it during the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show, Damon secured.
As a result, he was able to find a way to live out of the world.
Damon and Brown joined the producer brothers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly-Brothers to discuss the show finalists.
I would like to invite people to think about it - whoever is going to be the director - how they treat the tune of Harmony, Brown first said.
The only black person, and it is a cocoon that is beaten by its white pimps.
For the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio, the producer of dear White People fought for the race real in the movie; Damon replied that their regie at the end could give us something we do not want.
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded over Damons comments.
Twitter users, Mr Pooni, expressed his anger over the clip by writing to be the only black person in the room, so he can explain their variety - this is SO WEISS that it hurts to do it.
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retreats and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damons comments come at a time when there is precise racial representation in the media at the top of the social discussion.
After a white police killed Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter took effect nationwide and urged legislators and authorities to put a stop to discriminatory practices against Farmal.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
The album is still silent on the album, release albums still have their meaning "s he said," he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter Movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox-News-personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as a hate group.
The network Black Lives Matter is a group of love, told the leaders.
Recently, Damon was announced on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already taken the Pope, it is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior, the first Champion of the world.
The first athlete was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home at the Grand Prix of $1 million.
The contest show, which has just finished its 7 years, had never seen a competitor participant, who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finales they achieved two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, until the final.
The last task was to climb on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britt finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhausting Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! Messages after the hard won win, still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $1 million.
I think it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or have gone to life, said Isaac E!
So suddenly.. I cannot even imagine how this is about the future is unknown.
The lead producer Kent Weed worked with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final round, and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
If there is more than one finalists, it gets the fastest time, said Weed.
How much the money is a wonderful price and the life is changed, it gets the magnificent gradation.
I do not believe he has any trouble with him.
He has just been so happy to have done what he has done.
Masses of awards he received from fans.
He is a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: If I should be beaten by someone, then I am glad that it is Isaac.
And I think that Isaac would have felt just when they exchanged roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the filming will start in spring 2016.
Detroit Tiger Lessons at Minnesota Tward,
Minneapolis -- The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Once they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the tigers are at the last place in the American League Central.
The tiger was reduced to its role as a spoiler, but this part played its part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins played an opportunity for the rise within a slot of Houston Astros for the Second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, if only for an evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word, which was so hard to grasp for a great part of the second half of the season.
Performance All victories make fun, no matter how it is coming up, said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support, as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon's 13-9 confession beat 6 times to 1 in 3 innings and served to bring three rouns.
ES was only its third successful start in his last nine games.
I want to make a strong end this year," said Simon.
ES is hard to throw in the bullpen of each game, so I want to be very concentrated in the game.
The designer Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two Runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
ES was the first 3-dancer match of Martinez, Seitden he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
He did a good job, he said "Well," he said.
He saw good from playing down track training, it looked much better off in the Bullpen, and he brought it straight to the game.
With three rocking at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance of getting into the game again.
In the Field of Byron Buxton, the Inning finished with a double click on the left.
Right Parade of Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon put his second baseman Brian Dozier into the strikeout before being replaced by the left Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran Wall, the only man he was facing in front of the nominated Rookie drummer Miguel Sano, who tore a Two-Run away from the right-neck Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners and the Final Run during the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe into a double play.
ES ist das in der Major League leading 27. Mal in this season, that Plouffe beat a Double Play.
After Detroit added an Insurance-Run at the end of the ninth innate, the wall created a RBA double counter against the Closer of the Tiger Bruce Rondon and reached the level of 5-4.
However, Sano remains in three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited to the launch of the game from a still not mobile Phil Hughes.
The tigers reached three rouns in the first two innings against the plaintiff veteran who had been deleted from the vulnerability list prior to the game, having had more than one month to abstain.
To the obvious is not the start that I wanted, said Hughes, but I felt more comfortable than me, when I turned out and felt that I could create some pretty good pitches in the third ant would create a lot.
After they received the lead barons in the first, there was a single on Second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A Two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez to the game that managed to create a single ad up the middle round in the first round of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 successful series with Runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right hand, managed another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to find the third to finish the threat.
The players entered the second, achieved a one-Out Double of Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out Single from the heart of Anthony Gose to 3-0.
This was a big bang, said Twins-Manager Paul Molitor.
He did not fight in particular, but he got the job.
Hughes was in a Pitch-Count, did not score any points in the third inning before being replaced by the reliever right-handed A.J.Achter.
At Hughes, there were three rouns at six hits and a walk with four stripouts.

Hundreds of refugees are to be submerged in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
The arrival was expected for Wednesday on Wednesday.
The people involved are supposed to be housed in notaries in Wiesbaden, such as the city of Wiesbaden in the middle of the Tuesday evening.
They calculated from 450 to 750 prospective refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessen provincial capital were prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily suspended here.
They will then be extended to other communities.
Over the last ten days, according to the official government presidencies responsible for the first time, there have been 7500 people in Hessen.

Hobinger: German military action in syries an option
The head of the Munich security conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, holds military action with German participation in syria for an opportunity.
I believe that decisive thinking about military action options cannot be held without Germany, he said.
He accused the countries of Europe from looking at collectives looking for a solution.
Four years ago, one would have been glad that the Kelch passed away from Germany to Germany.
Now he is coming up against the conflict in front of our door, he said in German.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls on the southern and eastern borders
Once again Austria has introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Miklental tner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television broadcaster ORF, after Hungary, no one is sent back now.
Germany, too, has not sent any refugees to Austria.
No, it is agreed upon, it declared it.
On the question of an agreement whereby Germany could host a certain number of refugees from Austria on a daily basis, Mr Miklab's said, there have been talks on this matter between the Director-General for Public Security and the representatives of Germany.
She did not call it figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
Over the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees have been sent to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their destination is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State or Government, requested a special summit next week.
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis so far.
The EU Interior Ministers want to start a new attempt on the mandatory distribution of another 120 000 refugees on Monday, September 22, 2007.
In view of the strong refugee in Germany in Germany, the Confederation wants to give more support to countries in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The Confederation will manage this together with the countries, after almost four hours of consultation with the Prime Minister in Berlin, Merkel at the late Tuesday evening.
Merkel underscores that those people who need protection would be able to do so.
Those who do not have a say, cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was clearly expressed in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole needs to deal with a huge power plant.
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
In the night of Tuesday, Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia.
A few hours later announced the government in Budapest to also lift the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU.
Hungary's intention was to stop people seeking to avoid straddling through Romania, Hungary's Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, told us about the planned new border fence.
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan.
ES gave rise to the first arrests of people who had gone through the fence.
In Turkey, meanwhile, eyewitness accounts have revealed thousands of other migrants to the Greek border.
Space probe in the context of "Cassini" can be found on Saturnmond Enceladus.
Under the iceberg of the Saturnmoon Enceladus there is a global ocean.
This includes researchers from observations of the spacecraft of Cassini.
As a result, the moon could easily sew through its orbit around the ring planters.
Although not only small but still too large for a permanent celestial body, it is said in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca, New York State New York on Tuesday.
Researchers are presenting their analyses in the magazine "Icarus Relay."
For a long time, it was known that it must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006, Cassini already discovered Eisvulkane on the southern pole of the SaturnMoon, which feed steam and ice particles, thus feeding the so-called E-Ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole, there must be an underground sea, then the astronomers assembled at that time.
The expansion of the hidden ocean, however, was not resolved.
Rama does not exist in 1860 Munich for several weeks
The 1860 Munich must give up about a month on the open market, Valdet Rama.
An investigation carried out a contraceptive injury involving 27 years of the year, the association agreed with.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich lions, the diagnosis is likely to have four weeks forced break.
This is what makes us difficult, Rama is a Herber loss.
To be sure, we need to think about it now, said Sportdirector Necat Ayamicn of the image growns-newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a unidentified professional.
As a training guest, however, the Six first presented a Defensivmann.
The 30 years old Hrvoje Cale was active in Belgium in the past, as well as with VfL Wolfsburg under contract.

As early as Thursday, the Austrian national player should enter into career training.
Okotie had been in the match at Fortuna D√ºsseldorf stand 0: 3 on a fierce collision in the head.
Contrary to the first fears, however, he remained without a serious misunderstanding.
No Di√§t-Frucht - mangoes contain much sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy sweet.
But if you want to respect your lean line, they often tend to fall short of them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - mainly sacral.
Healthy are the most exotic fruits: They put B vitamins as well as the vitamines e and C., in particular, Mangoes, but much vitamin A, and its early stage beta carotene.
Those who are the fruits of ISST therefore support vision, the immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When you buy, Mangos should not be too soft or too hard to smell.
The bar color alone does not say anything about the ripe fruit - so it is also possible to taste some green mangoes.
They should be stored in room temperature and be consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, taste pure or sweet dishes.
A mango, however, also offers hearty dishes a particular note.
It alleviates the slightly bitter taste of some forms such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a Mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The UPS package service UPS provides up to 95,000 relief units for Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS posted on Tuesday.
Above all, drivers are looking for.
As early as last year, UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95,000 units.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor, FedEx, have been in the past since last year to be ready for Christmas.
In 2013, belated supplies brought some harsh criticism to the package services.
The first farewell, then prominent cold front:
In the coming night, in the valleys of the Alpine square side of the hair dryer erupted, as MeteoSchweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and during the night of Thursday, the hair-drier partly blows with storm strength through the frying valleys.
After travelling on Thursday morning, we have a strong cold front that leads to heavy rainfall, wind and temperatures.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of a large deep pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest flow.
On the Alpelles site, in the night, the sun shines through the valleys on Wednesday.
As a result, the hair dryer rises to Thursday morning in the conciliatory valleys with B√∂en from 60 to 100 km ahead, sometimes and especially in the Urnerland, in part, also with more than 100 km/h.
It is possible to penetrate the border into the adjacent Mittelland, which is also possible on the mountains of more than 120 km/h.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair drier for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture begins to crawl at the alpine slope.
Here, rain lasts until Thursday evening.
To sum up, south the Alps must be reckoned with in the next 48 hours, sometimes more than 100 litres of rain per square metre, having fallen in the last few days.

Together with the cold front the wind blows strong to stormy, and temperatures are falling sharply.
The following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, whereas in the south the weekend is sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome is now at the hands of Martin-Luthersquare
At about 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless place in the Park on the Oppio hill was baptized on the name of the German Reformator on Wednesday.
He is currently regarded as a German theologian of the Reformation, as a German theologian of the Reformation.
The Park lies in the middle of ancient Rome next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the Church of the Evangelical Church in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, the priest of the Evangelical community in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the pope have often been able to live their faith for centuries as a minority.
With the place it becomes symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome.
Martin Luther was born in 1483-1546 as a young Augustinian painter at the end of 1510 in Rome.
He received the city at the time as a scapegoat.
In his subsequent struggle against Rome, he would have liked to have the impression of his negative impressions in his later battle against Rome.
At the end of the 19th century, he began the division of the West Church with his theses against the Ablastrade.
Hat artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the BIBEL.
Jesus is one of the main works that Otmar painted for his BIBEL.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
The beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now been published with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who has written his personal interpretations of Biblisches stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
He has received the 75 year old language with colourful colours and imaginative forms - but this is by no means synonymous with fun images.
On the contrary, it can be very bleak indeed.
For three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many themes of the book of all books.
These are cycles that concern themselves as cross roads, plagen, precepts or mothers-our.
As a result he has fascinated several partners spontaneously: This applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as for Kettler's publishing house with its emphasis on art books.
And here there is the author Klaus Altepost, who has worked on the basis of painting with the respective biographies.
He has interpreted the Bible chosen by Otmar Alt and thus translated into the present, into current contexts translated into reality.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of content painting.
They are divided between the original Bible quotation from Martin Luther and each one of the artist who describes his own personal thoughts on the situation.
The jewelry package has got golden letters.
This allowed the 75-year-old man to have a deep insight into his soul, his emotions and his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggered for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode, born in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter-Order.
Since this was done with the tube base, Otmar Alt reminds of old.
I tried to work out that to try again with the Lord's father.
The second concern is to restore art in fast-paced time: The perception of visual worlds is shaped today by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is bound to do so.
Artists have a different desire to see things.
Images always have some secrets and are not decorative.
In this respect, I am a dinosaur old.
Otmar Alt wants to see that the viewer in the images let them fall into the images, leave them to work, discover and sense what force they have: The picture is looking for itself to be compared to the image.
Klaus Altepost strengthened on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-old Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, always being a lover of Otmar counts art to be: I like his life that he understands with his pictures.
I did not care about capturing the BIBEL in full, but also selected the most important, mysterious topics.
This was not a working relationship on eye level, says Altepost: Here is about the images, the text is explained only.
This work is an invitation to Hans M√∂hler from the Luther Publishing House to deepen his life and to find freedom to find his life.
Otmar pay pictures speak for M√∂hler both the spirit of Biblical language of love and responsibility.
A part of the originals - paper and picture images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.
The start of the BMX Railway line is close.
Plans have been made, decided to hire companies for a round course: One year later, almost everything was finished - yet again before the official inauguration of the BMX line has already been closed.
Failures in politics and management served as a cause of anger, especially among those living in the country who did not want to tolerate the railways.
So hill turned down, new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission.
Approval will be announced in October, the first town councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock will now be able to communicate to the child and youth committee.
I hope that this year has happened even more visible this year, she said.
It should be started without another pause for reflection with the work on the former indoor pool.
DFB is stepping up efforts for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is sending out a clear signal on the weekend.
The football reacts to the worsening situation in Germany, and is helping politics to address the challenges ahead.
I believe that this is the biggest challenge our country has faced since reunification.
As a rule, there can be no one to say that I have nothing to do with me, so I have nothing to do with it.
This must be done to each and every individual interested in getting to grips with this topic," said DFB boss Wolfgang Nimsbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
I am in the chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Mrs √ñzoƒüuz and the Chancellor.
As soon as the theme is sure to play a central role, he announced it.
Football could and can help.
However, the decisive course must be the policy.
The German Football Federation therefore has extended its Refugee Initiative 1: 0 for a welcome to four years.
We have decided to ensure that this program will continue until 2019 and that this program will continue until 2019, on the fringe of the UEFA-session in St Julian's in Malta.
Some of the federal figures support this program as well.
As early as this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will be sending a clear signal if they are going to support the print on the left skirt, instead of the otherwise usual sponsoring logo of Hermes.
We also want to make it clear that everyone is to be able to help, where and how they can only be able to do so, Rudi V√∂ller, as well as Rudi V√∂ller, said that he described the project as a matter of course as a matter of course.
The Battle of Refugees affects everyone, none of them must be seen.
We must be able to play football clubs, no, we must use our beam power, our influence and our means to help the many refugees who have already been so incredibly suffering, said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hopen Home Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a prominent symbol of the league.
At this Friday's championship match against Hungary, the women's national team invited 100 refugees to Halle, Saale.
He called the support of refugees as a big collaborative effort of German football.
That all 36 license associations had launched their own projects in their own locations would be great.
Equally great is that small and small clubs are active there.
The message 1: 0 for a Welcome to you that we spent is living in football.
This is of enormous importance, he said.
In this year and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide EUR 300 000 each year for the integration of refugees.
The clubs have already called the total sum for 2015, called kidney, reported kidney.
Reports: SAP Board of Directors is losing an eye in the event of an accident?
The head office of Europe's largest software corporation, Bill McDermott, reportedly lost the left eye by a fall in early July.
In the case of the accident on the TREPPE in the House of his brother in the house of his brother in the US he would have fallen after midnight on a waterglass that he carried on in the left hand, reports the annual economic week on Wednesday.
If He is almost verbal, was powerless, then came out into the road - so he told us so about it last week, quoting the wands of SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott could do his job, however.
Early October we meet at the meeting of the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf, said Plattner.
The 54 years old manager is at the meeting and is fully operational in the meeting.
McDermott announced in an interview with the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung on the occasion that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
I am fully in for SAP here, fully in my job.
Of course, of course, I had the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the SZ family.
McDermott normally trains between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, he said to the manager of the "SZ": Everyone can do something like that.
The most important thing is to come up again when you have fallen.

Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in Tor
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes of a comeback from Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europe League have finally been broken.
The player will be missing the table leader of the Football League in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday at 7: 00 am.
Unfortunately, we cannot rely on him, Thomas Tuchel was on Wednesday.
If you are going to be here on Sunday in the Bundesliga-Top Game against Leverkusen, the BVB coach is open: We expect a return from him to the training on Friday.
As a result of the heavy burden on its professionals, Tuchel will change his scalp not only on the Reus-position.
So he announced a change to the gate position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller opens up the place of master owned novel B√ºrki.
He trained at an absolute top level, the soccer teacher praised the world champion.
However, in the future, Weidenfters may be used in all European League games, however, allowed him to be open.
With a high probability, he will also contest the second game.
If you want to see for yourself that the finishing line for the BVB in the Europe League must be the goal, medium field player Julian Weigl is in a position to understand: This is not the wrong way to go about it.
I think that we have a good chance of picking up the title.
Robotic Cars: The Government's Lead for Germany
According to the Federal Government's willingness to change the car, Germany is supposed to be a technological pioneer.
The federal cabinett decided on Wednesday a strategic document from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt's CSU, which, among other things, provides for investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Automesse IAA from a new mobility age.
The automated and networked drive will increase road safety and ensure less stasis, said Dobrindt.
It also wishes to discuss this with its counterparts from the G7 countries, which will also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
A test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being carried out to test new technology.
In order for the driver not to be saddled with any additional liability risks, the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework conditions and adapt it to the new developments.
For example, Germany intends to use the maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres.
The Federal Government is also seeking to make a change to the Vienna Convention, which has so far only provided for people to be a driver.
When it comes to automated driving, the car takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the surrounding environment and process data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics, highly automated driving on motorways by 2020 will be technically possible.
However, drivers on public roads should not be expected to expect far after 2020.
Adding value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features at the location of Germany, the authors of the study estimate that the study will be around ‚Ç¨8.4 billion for 2025.
Digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic, said the SPD-Transport politician S√∂ren Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the passengers' personal data must clearly be resolved.
Still see Germans self driving cars skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey conducted by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday at the University of Forsa, commissioned by the Forsa Institute, reached the conclusion that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will win over the next ten years, 32% do not count on it in 20 years, 31% do not believe in this at all.
In France, 21% of respondents in until 2025 are driving with autonomous cars, in the US 33%.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the digital network Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to carry out control over the whole trip on all roads.
On the motorway, the traffic could be around 15 percent, in Stau 45 percent.
Good at all veins, the car would not be left under control under any circumstances.
Boll says Team - and double start with table tennis.
If you are looking for a perfect match for your event, we will be happy to welcome you to our booth in September 4 to 4.
The final decision is due to fall on 22 September at the latest.
This is a huge loss for our team.
The guys have heard it in the morning.
However, we are strong enough, even without Timo, to get the title, said German coach J√∂rg Ro√ükopf during the EMC course in D√ºsseldorf.
Boll was at this point on the flight to a long-term sponsored sponsor time in China.
The 34 year old German champion is expected to be back on Friday.
Ohne Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favorite, declared individual champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner who leads the betting list in Jekaterinburg, but also reminded of the Euro 2013 in Schwechat.
At that time, Timo was also missing, and we have become champions of Europe.
We should be guided by Daran, declared the world champion.
The British football player Luke Shaw from Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg.
The defender was hit by H√©ctor Moreno at the Champions League Game at PSV Eindhoven and changed after a long period of treatment.
The first diagnosis on the 20 years of old fellow players from Bastian pigs led to a break in the railway.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant awful.
ES ist eine mixture of very large Modenschau und a Wachsfiguren-Gruselkabinett: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier had an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: Window dressing buffers that look scary in video projections.
They are wearing the spectacular creations of the French designer who, among other things, was the star of the fashion scene with Madonnas stage outfits - and therefore that he put men in skirts.
Today I can no longer say that I am the duck of Haute Couture, because I have white hair.
In the past, it was easy, now it is real, said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk To The Catwalk To The Catwalk To The Catwalk to be seen on the sidewalk on the catwalk of the sidewalk on the catwalk, which is to be seen from September 18 to September at the Kunsthalle of Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the Moftsman has changed his attitude towards a SCHAU on his own.
In fact, he was against, because: For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death, he said.
If you die, you will come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Canadian Montreal and Paris.
It is about so much more than just beautiful dresses, said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
I am talking about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly surprising work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed the training.
Chronologically, the SCHAU is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed whole artwork, for which a lot of effort has been carried out: To freshen up the dolls, for example, a stylist has been set up for example.
14 tons of material have been transferred to Munich according to the information provided by the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the October festival there was also a special delicacy: A leather hour-outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women and women are smarter than men and people who are a bit different, said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old teddy, too, can be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, timid fashion designer by the designer.
As a child he was not a good student, and badly in football, he dressed up his teddy BHS and Clothes, said Gaultier.
With a doll to play, his parents would not have allowed him.
He then brought them out of fashion and then brought them away from them.
He studied steel fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers, such as Gaultier in Munich.
Later, however, I bought them, of course.
For his first fashion show he did not pay for the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clots.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Something top as Mode-Nic
Earlier it went to the long embroidery machines in and around chat to make meters.
The embroidered substances and tips were created in large quantities for customers that, for example, they carry on blankets and yarns further processed.
This alone is no longer working anymore," explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of moists.
Stattdem is the fashion again important again.
In the initial stages of the talking tip played a bigger role, then came into being by the home textile industry - and is now re-discovered as a niche.
Reinhardt describes some examples: Lace in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
At the same time, the so-called vinyl mode, which refers to past styles, is a growing of the order potential.
Anyone who does not use niches in the textile sector in Germany is no longer on the market.
They already have half of the orders out of us.
With more than nine other companies, Betsson is a member of the business association chat and embroideries.
Only they can carry the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have been broken.
Private trade and even the wholesale trade are almost no longer available.
Our products hardly ever reach customers in this way.
Today, the bulk goods are produced much more cheaply in Asia, and almost exclusively distributed by chains.
Moreover, the export, to Russia and to the US, is weakening.
There are enough reasons for new paths.
The industry association also tries to make environmental awareness on points such as Cordula Bauer from the embroidery perle in Falkenstein: Since this year we produce a seal of quality that shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable produce.
Reinhardt adds: It also refers to the materials used.
Diploma Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg outsider of the western Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, we need to find high quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the brightest ideas of the designers and the businesses that have to think above all economically, says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design often varies slightly in order to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, a few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
At some points, the machine sticks to small chunks.
The happy goldsmith Bianca, Bianca Hallebach-Krault, was inspired by this: Previously, I could not start with a traditional conversation with him.
Now she is using the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a complex process she shapes the pattern in silver.
Many people in the region identify with the subject of chat - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in chat and environment and want to be a memory.
In this way, I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the speaking tip.
Disney plans to buy Mary Poppin's t movie.
If you don't want to touch them, Disney will still venture into a new movie of her classic Mary Poppin.
However, this is not a question of reprints, but rather about a kind of sequel, which takes 20 years after the first movie with the magic nanny.
It is about the experience of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
If you play Poppin over 50 years after Julie Andrews, it is still unclear.
But the director is already fixed: Rob Marshall, most recently with Into the Woods in the cinema.
XI urges the wider world to be opened up to the world.
The economy must be opened up wider outwards to promote growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday of a group tasked with managing the reform.
China should strive to attract foreign investment and expertise, and to improve strategies for business start-ups, he said in a speech at the 16 meeting of the central management group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
Encouraging new start-ups and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new opportunities for economic growth," Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a series of directives, including a negative list to regulate market access, relax control of border control policies, encourage government firms to borrow private capital, and overhaul the depositary reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is tested according to and tested and improved through test programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a constitutional business environment, and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also relax controls on delegated powers and make businesses decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of a bid to open state controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financed enterprises and provide better services for them, said the statement.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the Green Card in order to optimize the requirements and facilitate the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their activities and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also took Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double the price of mercury in predatory fishing
The European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large predators and to allow consumers to expect a much higher dose of nerve.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has an equivalent working paper in the EU, criticized the plans: Risks and adverse effects on the environment and the side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy are being carried out with full force on pregnant and toddlers, explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Mr Sterckx, the limit values of the nerve trap for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, for economic reasons, will be increased from one kilogram of fish to two milligrams per kilogram of fish.
However, large fish stocks today are so heavily contaminated with mercury that, based on the limits that are still in force, some 50 percent of catches cannot be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5% would be UNVERK√ÑUFLICH.
In exchange for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Food Watch called this the trick, because smaller gravefish, such as carp, are usually so low that they are already complying with the planned maximum levels.
For this reason, the reduction in small quantities would be a perfidious red herring that is helping the economy alone; Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to the people, which is heavily enriched by the food chain, especially in predatory fishing.
The Federal Government is therefore warning that already small quantities can cause problems for the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn injuries.
The German Ministry of Environment explains on his homepage in view of the current maximum levels, that a health threat to the general population is not expected to be expected.
Mercury reaches into the environment, in particular due to the burning of coal.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, Annalena Baerbock received more than six tonnes of mercury annually in Germany, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, such as the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, was permanent and extensive, had been quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish already reported to the most commonly reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
Foodwatch calls consumers to protest against the EU's plans at: Www.cementber-shareholders. Feed watch.de.
