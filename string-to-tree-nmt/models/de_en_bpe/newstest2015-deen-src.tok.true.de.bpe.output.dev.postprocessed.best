According to reports, India is hoping for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Police of Karratha arrested 20 years after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove him to a 70 km/h zone and bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic policemen in Karratha tried today this morning to stop a blue motorcycle, after they had seen it, as with 125 km/h left a petrol station on Bathdate Road.
The police reported that the driver ignored the stops and continued on the Burgess road before going out into the bush land, where the officials lost it out of sight.
The motorcycle, as well as a person who responded to the driver's description, were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The police of Karratha accused a 20-year-old man of neglect of a stop as as well as reckless driving.
He is due to appear on 23 September in front of the court in Karratha.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is standing in court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read in a hearing from the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of having raped a woman in Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that webster they attacked, while they were "unconscious, sleeping, and no agreement was possible."
On 4 May 2014, Webster was accused of rape a second woman in the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Highlands of Scotland.
Judge Lady Rae set the date for November 17th at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Return to the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights
The congress director Keith Ellison and John Lewis have put forward a legislative proposal to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
"How labor unions die, the middle class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat of Minnesota, and Vice President of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
For this reason, I am proud to present the Staff Regulations Act with the citizen's author John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in terms of discrimination on the basis of the organisation of trade unions, like other forms of discrimination - and stops such anti-union forces.
The addition to national law on labour law, in order to create a possibility for discrimination against employed workers to organise trade union representation, in order to bring justice to a civil court for justice - and in order to receive compensation or penalties - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the further sponsors of its legislative proposal suggest, is the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks experienced by trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries across the country - Americans once have encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and sustain work rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans were reminded when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to freedom in the same breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy hedki tojos was replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that workers and their unions have a role to play in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "the rights of workers on unification and collective bargaining and action" is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his team pressed the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would need to organise themselves and their voice in the new nation, the Germans mounted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each and every professional or trade.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it are null and void; these measures are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the Presidency on the International Human Rights Commission, drafted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors gave a guarantee that 'everyone has the right to form unions or join them in order to protect trade unions'.
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that human rights are human rights.
As this country advised other countries to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a union - and that this union should then be able to participate in collective bargaining as an equivalent partner with businesses and government offices - must be protected.
Having seen these rights in America under attack, it is indeed very wise to remind the American ideal that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago, he said:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not limit the nation's strength, but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has been a miraculous way of creating a market for industry and raising the whole nation at unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History is reminiscent of this, and that is what we should be doing.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America history in the past and the promise of democracy.
Magistrates do not stop at law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could be forced to shut down.
A US judge on Sunday provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, from the lawyer, that it would probably have resulted in the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was imposed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June, was brought to the law in June and is to come into force on 1 September, would compel doctors who carry out abortions to acquire a patient's right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the judgment of the judge means that, for the time being, the doctors can still carry legally abortions when they request such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work while they seek to obtain these rights," wrote Federal judge John degravure in his judgment.
Within a month there will be a hearing for the judge in order to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a number of judgments against similar measures, and to say that doctors would so much more time to obtain hospital authorization rights.
"The decision today is that, in Louisiana, the women in Louisiana escape a law that they want to miss out on their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chair of the Center for reproductive rights, which, on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state, took to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict was covered by the doctors from the two clinics, who did not associate themselves with the complaint and have also requested permission for permission.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such operations in Alabama and Mississippi for not constitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to be closed, have been stopped by a German judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecomas, as well as the American Medical Association, are united in demanding unnecessary restrictions imposed by doctors' right to consent.
Abe's opponents believe that the measures are designed to protect the health of women, although some have also welcomed the impact of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who conducts abortions in Louisiana has patient recognition, shared the center for reproductive rights.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop carrying out abortions, this doctor would not be able to do the surgery out of fear for his safety.
In their arguments against the ruling, representatives of the state of Louisiana were saying that they would not be punished because of the execution of abortions, whereas their applications would still be pending patients' rights.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to the best possible treatment results in higher death rates for ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put their mother online, who died in ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in Australia's rural areas, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data from more than 1100 Australian women, in which ovarian cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25% five years after the diagnosis was still alive.
The research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDIE: New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian cancer.
Researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing prediseases, as well as social and economic status, also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk was 20 percent higher in the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not study why people living outside the city were dying most likely to be infected with ovarian cancer, Dr Jordan suspected a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly to be found in major cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counter distances, they proposed, as a possible remedy, a reinforcement of the service of frozen doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to supply women to their homes, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical status, the study resulted in a poor long-term life rate for women in ovarietal cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study carried out by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013 Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres deplore declining house owners
The decline, together with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could lead to a decline in garden centres to tens of thousands of pounds a year, when today's young consumers reach for a study of HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, the "age group for garden products."
The report says that the owners spend an average of 55 percent of the amount spent on their own garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of planing for parking for parking, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which there is an estimated £5 billion annually spent on sale.
In the metropolitan area of London, where over a period of 6 years the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43%, the lowest expenditure for garden products is reported for each household.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot have plants.
Guy Barter, CEO of RHS said: "Container gardening is very popular with tenants because they can bring their plants to a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retailers due to rising house owners and economic prosperity from the late 1980 to the mid-1990s.
It also predicted a better market situation for this year because of the better weather in March and April of last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan headed by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Tibetan Tahirul Qaddafi continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, about 1 000 demonstrators captured the state television station PTV.
Information Secretary Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station's operating system for about 40 minutes, however, is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, around 3000 demonstrators tried to enter the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around one kilometer away they saved themselves with sticks and stones equipped with security guards.
The police stopped teargas.
The demonstrators called for Sharifs's resignation, but they reject it.
Meanwhile, the army in the country is calling for a political solution to the conflict, 'without wasting time and not using force'.
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military informed: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The military has an important role in Pakistan and has been more frequent.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accused Premier Sharif to have cheated during the parliamentary elections in May of last year.
The protests had escalated at the weekend after Khan and Qaddafi called their followers to invade Sharifs's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey ordered US diplomat for espionage reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs entered into a report on American and British espionage in Turkey on the basis of a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the US Embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel, as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analysts from the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major activity for the US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries spy on each other.
An earlier report that was aimed at Germany's most important Federal Service, too, caused much more disturbing reactions from the Turkish Government.
Warning strikes: Drivers threaten with consequences for commuters.
The nationwide warning strike of the driver on Monday evening could also affect the movement of people in NRW.
The stand had been announced for 18 to 21 o'clock nationwide all transport companies, including remote, regional and suburban rail transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

Said the district chair of the German locomotive trade union (GDL), Sven SchMitte, in Düsseldorf.
We are counting on significant failures.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
The German Railway in NRW announced to do everything in order to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it would be difficult to predict the consequences.
Police Chief of Magaluf accused against corruption
On Friday, the prosecutor gave evidence for extortion by the police and employees of the city of Calvià on Friday to the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The chief police officer of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca, after corruption charges of businessmen and landlords, was arrested in the notorious binge-drinking-hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, was arrested in detention for him from several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the road in which most of the bars and nightclubs are in Magaluf.
According to the hotel's online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutor made evidence to the Office of the Public Prosecutor Office for the fight against corruption in Mallorca on Friday for blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
Two more local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the corruption charges and are being consulted jointly with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish newspaper ABC reported that the angry Nightlord owners said that the government's cronies have a serious effect on their business.
"It is not about earning money, it is about survival," said one of the businessmen the court.
Let our living out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer on the basis of a viral YouTube video showing a 18year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a trip in Fellatio.
The island authorities have since been trying to stop the illegal behaviour of alcoholic tourists in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious non-alcoholic tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the fur event took place, was forced to close down for a year for a year to be closed, while Playhouse and pub boarding organizer Carnage must pay a penalty of €55.000 ($73,000) together.
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British tourists, is also known for a number of accidents in the area of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing," in which people jump from one balcony to the other or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring of the day with wet and stormy weather conditions impairs flights from Adelaide Airport.
The spring has brought a windy surprise to southern Europe, with strong winds and strong winds that affect Adelaide from the airport.
In the evening, up to 9 p.m., there were more fat rain on the city, to 6.6mm, which had already gone on the night to Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormed Schauer, including a bus that began shortly before 8 o'clock, causing nearly 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After winter last week for an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city on Monday again fell to a maximum of just 15.8 ° C.
The rainy weather probably led to the late landing of a flight of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane would have landed only shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a shredder - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to be carried out.
At this point, the wind was about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to run on a second landing, and eventually took place at about 20.40.
As a result, the flight delay resulted in some of the other flights, including an embankment of Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday with potential spectacles.
Matthies thinks: High time is great.
In view of the galloping technical progress that is threatening to turn our comfortable home in high tech mode, our columnist Bernd Matthies, with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
While I write that here comes to the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind this: If the cable would not be, all listeners would be able to fly around the house in the shortest possible time, and that would still be significantly more retro.
Anyway, at the ekeltronic (ekeltronic)?
No, typos: Electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is from tomorrow, bought from tomorrow, bought out - out of date.
And who, for example, today still has a colour TV in the living room, who is simply saying that it is fundamentally opposed to television.
Why?
Because the inshore of the Ifa at the radio tower this week keeps us in front of our absolute incompetence on questions of electronics.
The Laie, formerly used as a washing machine and CD player, does not currently understand the purpose of the devices that can be spread to it with an indescribable expert sprech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care, and Urban Technologies" the press office promises to us.
Yes, can it still?
What is to be said about people who seem to spread to such Quark voluntarily?
After all, for about 20 years, it has been about the fact that we are supposed to interconnect our institution.
So that the yogurt itself can be ordered in order to inform us of the fires on holiday on the Maldives that it burns in the working room.
And would it not be wonderful if we had air conditioning from the air conditioning system to our arrival in the near future?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will soon come true: We will lift our watch, say "Saugen!." - and at home the vacuum cleaner goes away.
Misleading.
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution as a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods strapped," raunt an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with headphones, the steam garer sends the weather report and the data brille shows how long pizza in the oven still needs, but this is not useful, since we are in Stau.
We also know from our daily practice: If a modern device is really desperately needed, the battery will be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children are returning to their schools after the war in Gaza.
Thousands of Israeli children from the territories in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after they had spent the summer in airguards, while missile and mortar fire on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area was able to recover from the fighting.
The start of the school launched a feeling of joy and expectation in the south of Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod remote staff of the "Pashosh" -nursery that was taken from a rocket, before reaching the student grenades from the walls and sliding.
"We have a bit of fear, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, mate in Kibbutz Saad and her English teacher.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a bit funny" to suddenly go to school.
"These were difficult times, and we did not go out of the house at all," he said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza in order to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad stayed in their houses or left their homes to escape into safer areas further away from Gaza and escape the missile and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer, are still hesitating to return.
The Ministry of Education informed that, for example, a dozen or so families had not yet returned.
Their children have been placed in other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town on Gaza, which was heavily attacked by Palestinian strikes.
He called upon the children to learn a lot and said "we will ensure that their knowledge is collected and give you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an open-ended ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided for an immediate end to the fighting; but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for the Israeli blockade of Gaza to be lifted and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel is calling for the disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these claims and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters but have not provided any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military led more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gazan area, and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protected spaces and the fighting continues, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school is open again, so that we can continue learning like children in the world and the Jewish children, 'said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza city.
After the elections in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl question NPD-prohibited actions in question: CDU-Vize Strobl.
In view of the vote losses of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-dog vize Thomas Strobl pronounced in favour of an end to the current NPD ban procedure prior to the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - Laut CDU-dog vize Thomas Strobl should put an end to the ongoing prohibition against the NPD prior to the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse off than last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU farm in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung."
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
At the end of the vote on Sunday, the NPD failed to fail at the five-percent hurdle.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party was a failure on the part of 2003 because constitutional protection had also been informants at the time, even in the NPD-peak.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe for a long time.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join forces.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the newcomer Square, refugees are now being placed in tents.
The company's initial reception for refugees in Harburg is bursting out of all sewing patterns.
Now, the Interior Authority has put three tents from the Red Cross in the near future.
The district councillors were first informed - they are not very enthusiastic about it.
"These attacks continue to animate the citizens and give district politicians no opportunity to cooperate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, group leader in the Harburg district assembly.
Their party is calling for the district administration of Harburg currently providing unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be housed in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the initial picture are the onslaught of help seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in subsequent institutions.
Many refugees therefore remain more than the regular three months.
The house prices have seen the strongest winter growth in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value index for homes in the Australian capital increased in August by 1.1 percent, so the RP-data from Monday.
Thanks to this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August at 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual growth rate at 10.9%, more than double the rise in the 12 months to August 2013, but increases were not evenly spread across the country.
The Research Head of RP Data, Tim Lawless, stated that Sydney and Melbourne were driving a two-tier market.
The figures from RP data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent in the past year, and in Melbourne, by contrast, by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by five and six percent on average.
On the other end of the scale, Canberra was hit hard by the cuts in state spending, and where prices rose by only 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lawless said that, with spring fishing, there will be an increase in the number of real estate sales for the next few months, which would be a real test of the market.
"If you consider the constant high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the ongoing low interest rate, it is likely that home prices will rise over the next three months," he said.
In an opinion on the new press, it contradicts statements by the managing director Peer Medau and attests to this "as a Feldherr."
The College's style is not what it says in the communication.
As a result, the Medau family had been informed orally by the college in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were not known until July is definitely wrong," he said.
At the same time, he says that the plans are not "preconceptions or even decisions," but there would be "preferences."
Also the extension of the narrow road for access to the car park is less dramatic than was feared by the unions.
Of a nine metre wide road was not the speech.
It is about 5.50 meters, which is a metre wide than it has been until now," explains Pstilll.
The decision of the Medau operators that they only use their own parking areas in the future will only be used by students of the university, so they do not want to be affected.
Parting is not possible at all, because it is now intelligently solved in other public parking spaces.
The Beloved of the Belden
According to the university president, the children's crab mountain pasture, which is located on the site and would lead to the parking deck on their doorstep, should not be affected by the President of the university.
On the contrary, he needs to bear in mind that this is not just about the nanny, but also about the residents at the entry into the Friedrich-Stacker-Straße and the 800 students of the nearby real school.
So it is much more than about vested interests of Mr Medau," he says.
Whether or not the critique of the parents of the child crib, with the extension of the road would be lost to a "the few natural spots of Coburgs" justified, "can the reader decide for itself."
At the beginning of October Pentzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, intends to inform the town councillors about the development of the university until 2020 and, in this context, to raise awareness of the importance of new development."
During last week Medau informed the parents of the crib about the university's plans.
So the access for the new parking deck is not supposed to be about the campus and the Friedrich Stung Street, but over the Medau Mountain.
The narrow road, for about a kilometer length, should be extended two-lane.
According to high bills of the Medout, the traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would be ten times more.
We hear about 2000 cars on a daily basis.
So far, the city has not wanted to comment on the project.
Glandorf comes back from handball national team back home.
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old by SG Flensburg-Handewitt first introduced health problems for this decision.
The decision has not been easy to say, it has been matured for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals from my body and finish my career in the national team," the world champion in 2007 split on his Facebook page.
It is thus about a balance sheet of 167 countries playing and 576 gates for Germany in international retirement.
He is no longer available to the new Head of German coach Dagur Sigurdsson, because they want to go hunting for the Champions League champion in Flensburg for a few years.
With the Isländer, who on Tuesday announced his cadres for the country matches against Switzerland, Glandorf carried out a long and very good conversation.
My ideas and approaches have just as enthusiastic me as they will inspire my colleagues and my successors.
However, for my club, I want to be healthy in the years to come, for which there is a need for longer regeneration breaks, which do not allow the present double burden.
At 2012, the left-handed movement had to fear his career as a result of Ferseninfection.
Because of its agonizing problems, he had been treated by a team physician of the German Handball Association (DHB) with a Cortisoninjection, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then, Glandorf announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national career careers do not pass unnoticed in any body.
I have a few health sites that I cannot ignore anymore.
After the three infectious foot operations that took place in a short period of time in 2012, I have never managed to get my blood pressure under control.
In this regard, there are some other wearable related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I can control my head, but my body cannot deceive," Glandorf explained in the interview "Handball Time."
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"If all the steps are drawn, I am always willing to speak," said the two-fold family of the trade magazine.
However, I can count on the years in which I can still play handball.
I must also say that, after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have become quite humidified as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, I want to at least be able to do so at least.
In addition to the World Cup in 2007 and the winner of the Champions League 2014 in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo), he took the EF-cup.
In 2012, he secured the European Cup winner with Flensburg.
German economy in the spring by 0.2 percent
The crises around the globe have held back the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell from April to end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter by 0.2 percent.
The Federal Statistical Office agreed with this, thus confirming provisional calculations.
Only consumption revived the economy in the spring, while the investments went back.
Trade, too, has slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual record, for the first half of a year, a GDP increase is 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste," which led to the castle on Sunday for the first time.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar met on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "Fietzer."
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, hosted the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste."
It is the biggest cycling route crossing the Münsterland, the cycling paradise close to the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked for the organization of this tour through the Münsterland with their enrolment at Jos en Huerne.
The tour was offered in various professional journals in different journals.
We came from Den Helder and went through night to participate in this trip.
We want to get to know the city of Münsterland in this way too," cheered cyclists over the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration at the association of SchützenfracSta.
Katharina went on a small "journey of peace" through the city over the wall, where the launch took place.
The route passed for three different categories, in the direction of Herrenholz over the Schöppinger mountain in the direction of Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On a distance of 95 kilometres at 1175 m height, 120 km with 1475 m elevation and 145 km with an altitude of 1775 metres, the cyclist proved their good condition.
They have been living on the road in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The organizer Heinz Lölfing showed great satisfaction about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for all concerned.
The organization ran without problems and there was no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing a positive conclusion to this event.
Unfortunately there were not as many participants as the organizer wanted, which was probably due to bad weather forecasts and the dawn rain.
"We will be able to meet again in 2015 with nice weather on 30 August or during a different weekend, but the cyclists promised to return to the Münsterland again and the organizers plan a new version.
Retaliation from a wake-up call in the wake of honest memoirs
There is, in fact, more philosophical testimony as biography of what Constantine Wecker, Songmacher, pacifying, politicized activist, ex-prisoner, in "monk and Warrior" has brought to 287 pages on paper.
Born in Munich on June 1, 1947, founded his memoirs on 1 June 1947, each chapter begins with an appropriate song text.
He is ruthless in this matter: From Onanie as high school, to shopkeepers and drug use, he is not responsible for human weakness.
Also to show how he has learnt tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also takes abstract but all the more important terms: Love, soul, ego, that being in the now, spirituality - all this tries to go on the ground, to a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and also, as he did not just dominate music (opera lover became soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker to the asketic monk, which he says, "by subtraction," as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary."
There are also, however, a few anecdotes on the earth: For example, about mosquitoes in a pub frequented by GIs, or a crazy car ride head-on a tree.
Here, too, he is ruthless.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Never said 'I love you'!
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearsed for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a blend of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One could never see his face, heard only his voice: "hör with the collar.
Let your sister calmly.
Move on!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life was he was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry launched a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than at his father's times, he won an insight into how life would have been for him.
It is now somewhat brighter, but it is dark, rough and deep, deep style labyrinth with flame retardant and smoke and a lot of cries.
In the past, my father simply came to the bath and then he was able to listen to him how he started to sing, because he could wash up the foundry.
When I ran there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring food to the table, and my respect for him was greater.
Yet, as a child, Henry grew up without any love of his parents.
My father embraced me never, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went badly at the end of her life, we began, "I love you, I love you, I love you," I love you.
With his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love that he was missing as a child.
Are you going to stop "I love you"?
Stop me to hug me!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still with French that he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys's mother was diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I was very, very important, and symptoms of diabetes pointed out, my doctor said you have to be radical.
So I took care of this fitness and had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henrys's career change can be seen in his elegant, short cut bar.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he is captured from the theatre.
It followed the comedy of the aberrations, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and coman have completed their busy working life.
He started with just 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
He started his television career in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black Imitator/comedian on television for a fairly long time.
He learned in the profession.
I had to be large not only in the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient Witze-narrator machine when I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program, in which the people "black anmold" took him over five years over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish that it never happened, but I do not regret that I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I was working on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
With the introduction of figures that both celebrated the British black culture, Henry was working on an alternative comedykreis in the 1980's.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the 1990s he was also known as the chef de chef de Blacklock in the Comedyserie boss!
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and movie reels marked his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because everything feels like you're doing just the time rum or standing a bit on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About about?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was extremely allergic to Shakespeare.
I never learned something about him at school and thought it was mostly for a domain of middle class, white in tights and a carbon head.
So I had great fear of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said.
Do not make it bad if you do not know what you are dealing with.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we love all the Shakespeare so dear.
Henry conducted 20 lines from Othellos's final speech for the documentary film and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do that.
It was almost like someone gave me the head at the right place.
"This is about it is a serious thing, take them seriously, gather your text, researched a bit.
The samples were brutal and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car crash, and that simply did not happen.
And soon he came up in the comedy of delusion.
Suddenly, I was in the National Theater and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought "Oh, you have changed.""
There was a technical mistake and Henry felt instinctively that he had to maintain the public.
'A little voice said me' you have to bridge 10 minutes while repairing the computer "."
Instead, the stage leader proclaimed that the idea would go on as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went from the stage and something in me said "Oh, God thank God."
I am not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so be in your role."
Henry in Fences on the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
That, too, was a good thing, so it is like a big shield from the gods saying 'This is your destiny'.
He says so, of course, with a thinning vote.
So I shall stick to it.
I really love it.
I love to be in a sample room.
Henry, however, still remains the head of a comedian - our conversation is interwoven with humorous eruptions, while he always imitates people.
I decided not to make a stand-alone comedy, because I think that this kind of instant gratification of a room is somehow dangerous.
If you want to do that forever, you go to a wall.
I sometimes speak live in Apollo, if I have a desire to do so, but overall, there is not as much as I did in the past.
I ask him if he will ever make a stand-up Comedytour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I do not think that I want to give up.
So, is that its new incarnation here?
I think so.
I am happy to be an actor.
It is fun.
It is always told a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
The people love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital.
In the conflict between Shia Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis is calling for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi-trailers occupied central roads in Sanaa on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi-Party "Ansar Allah."
Parliament's access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Condoleezza Post," Huthi-leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi, threatened by the hand of a further escalation of the conflict, should not meet his demands.
The Shia Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni Yemen, and demand the government's resignation.
The Huthi tribe besieges the Yemeni capital for nearly two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps at the great influx of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers civil servants to contain "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to register biometrics in order to delete all government officials in order to delete "ghosts" from the government's salary lists.
Staff who are not registered in the next two weeks would not pay more, was a government communication.
The government is assuming that thousands of people will also receive payouts after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in public service when he took office in 2013.
At a test at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700,000 pounds) per month were lost to payments for "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices.
According to the government that salaries continue to be paid to accounts after a person has died or leaves public service, Wanyama reports to Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear in the next two weeks in identification centres to ensure that their data is recorded on biometric registrations, was reported in a government statement.
All those who did not do so without a credible excuse from the salary list continued the communication.
"By this approach it is essential to rationalise the public service by fixing the actual number of civil servants, and also eliminating the pay list at both levels of government," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art adviser Helge Achenbach is to be held in court on 11 November for the first time.
Five heirs from Berthold Albrecht, the son of the Aldi-Grünist Theo Albrecht, demand a compensation from Achenbach and two of his companies that are in insolvency proceedings in a civil process at the Düsseldorf District Court.
That divided a lawyer on Monday.
In the scriptures, Achenbach, in the acquisition of works of art and vintage cars, betrayed him more than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission rate would have been higher.
Achenbach purchased items of value for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
44 years he was in school, 23 as Head of the School.
For this time, Manfred Richter knows a lot of Petershausener and Kollbacher from their age as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventionally, but always carried out by his ambition to see people in the student.
The snowmobile is the most famous mountain of the Krkonose Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Judges were born in Trautenau, Northern Bohemia in 1930, and today Trutnov.
At the age of 14 he became the head school for the teacher profession after four years of secondary school.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their homes.
After a couple of months in one camp he went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight car.
As a result, judges moved to the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg, Germany.
For this to happen, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week to the nearest train station, to the train to Bamberg, there three kilometres across the whole city to go to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter received a sleeping opportunity in a Rot-Kreuz-Home in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 female students in a bedroom room.
In 1951, he made the second official name in the first and 1954 after three years of apprenticeship.
However, as he did not have a free place for him, he turned to Oberbayern and came to school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "milling machine room" was its first "office apartment" in the school building.
In 1958, he introduced a three-room service in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school was dissolved in Kollbach 1968.
Until then there was in Kollbach in the School of Petershausen-Kollbach three classes and in Petershausen five.
At the time of the school year 1968/69, these were grouped together in Petershausen in the current town hall.
As the Association of Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
To avoid reclassification in the smaller school, then the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsruhe and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers from September 1982 were able to refer to today's construction, which was extended after Judge retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the ease of generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, in addition, built a workshop room for municipal expenses in 1997, although it was not eligible for the guidelines for school constructions.
"Mayor Götz was very schoolfriendly," he remembered.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter never forgotten the intervention of a government representative who responded to a unit of a school council on justice and justice: 'You must never have forgotten love': 'You must never have forgotten love', what he had heard since as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: Roots and wings," says today 84-year-old.
He had to learn: "He cannot always succeed."
In any case, Judge actions were sometimes unconventional.
When pupils examine themselves, they did not have a criminal record, nor did they sit on the sidelines.
At the expense of the congregation, Judge created two pairs of boxing gloves and gave the two opposing parties to each other, even if there were some haggling.
For the benefit of the school, Judge as Rector placed a good relationship with the former mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the non-party judge after his retirement to stand in 1996 at least as the last on the list for the local council.
But judges were elected to place six and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bike drivers set up in the spa gardens of Bad Salzhausen and Scots stopovers.
If Radler turns on her tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots Rast, this is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of surgeries alone: The 700 participants in the hr4-Rad tour accompanied by an accompanying horse enjoyed a break in the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the famous Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Radli and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and saw a concert of Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday it was serious: The cyclists took the first stage, which took place 60 km through Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and continue to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of the mayor Hans-Peter Marconi, who had taken part in the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the manager of the private plant Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwung Döring, were welcomed.
For the refreshment of body and mind was prepared all sorts of good things: The rural women from Ranststadt and Nieder-Mockstadt have baked 85 sheets of apple, rabbits, litter and cheese cakes, which were a great treat for the powerful cyclists.
"This cake can be used only for land women," praised a participant in Aulendiebach, while he did a further contribution.
Cold refreshments could be found on the beverage status of the Scourge.
The "duo Bravo" kept the visitors with famous melodies from operettas and musicals and attracted enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the Park had a relaxing effect.
A colleague, moreover, enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "he earned him, he has finally put his finger on his bike again today."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company's manager had to work: They were interviewed at the well before the drinking station by reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
As well as promotional director Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-Radtour 2004 as tour leader, managed to just keep in touch, he had plenty to do with the technique on the ground.
His PickUp slider, in which he communicated with three phones and a radio machine with his employees and the 15-headed motorcycle guide by the police of Hessen, also required a check on Facebook.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region," he told "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from many cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants is limited to the amount of accommodation that is available.
In Category I will be housed in hotels, in Category II in collective reviews.
From the resort, the cyclist had a good impression when she returned after a period of one and a half hours: "Chüss!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!
After arriving in Scots, the group was allowed to pause.
But in the evening the cyclist was called in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the Park had a beautiful fixture and of course had prepared leaks, such as flame pie with well cooled headlights.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS-CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sach greeted the visitors in his role as a member of the board of directors of the ADAC Hessen-Thuringia.
The Three were visibly happy about the "many running in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen gave the dance stage free of charge.
Despite the sport on the bike, the opportunity was being used intensively on the bicycle.
Among the guests, increasingly citizens have been attracted by the good mood as well as the great schar of cyclists.
On the second day for cyclists the stations Birstein, Guarditersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trench rollers - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycle, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on the grounds of "conspiracy against the government" to report local media agencies.
The police authorities did not give an immediate commentary.
Among the detainees are 14 high level police officers, report Đriyet Daily News.
Some were involved in the corruption charges against government officials, including four ministers of government last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for launching an organised criminal association and shelling telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the activities held by the Islamist clerical clerical manure against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine are returning to school back.
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1st September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
He informed journalists that not all schools had been open again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The september celebrations were not held in any school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian public front, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, school teacher at the School in Slawjansk visited Jazenjuks's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will be restored here and that children will be given a form of education that will be useful in the longer life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, while the children wear embroidered shirts, hold ballons in the hands and give flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
It meets with a proud rest from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Torah Party.
And it has its own front experience.
Her career began in the global management consulting company, Bain and Co., to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of Pearsons.
For seven years, he was Chief Executive of the Financial Times and resigned when the top post of parent company Pearson went to a younger male colleague.
Their compensation was expected to be nearly £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron from Lord Browne, the former Chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private business in Whitehall: She was appointed advisor in the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
As long ago as May, I described the task of the Chairman with a poisoned Kelch.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex entity in the very heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
There is faith in two directions: Internally to the first guard of their own mania hierarchy in the BBC, but also externally as a voice of public concern and disquiet when things go wrong.
This amounts to an almost unsustainable duopol that requires a full comprehensive reform.
But what new president would risk is going to be up, running on everything and breaking up an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while itself it is perhaps about its job.
It is a difficult task.
And, as if that were not enough, many would also like to see the BBC be reduced - power, money, and status.
While competition is closer and new technologies threaten to threaten old, comfortable collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of licence fees for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of $145.50 a year, the British public is buying the world's largest media.
The BBC tells a good story: It tells you that it reaches 96% of households and it costs only 40 pence a day.
And, apparently, the BBC is rising to the popularity rating: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: Today I get messages on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a great chairman - I hope she has found it.
Robin from Texas says that venting Tweet was not authorized.
A Tweet from the official user account of Texas's Republican governor, Rick Perry, on Sunday, contained a belated remark about the democratic district prosecutor, which is at the heart of a criminal prosecution against him because of abuses of authority.
The Tweet was deleted later and replaced with another part from the previous account.
Right now a tweet was sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I did not approve the Tweet and I deleted it," he said in the later message.
Employees of Perry did not answer immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perrys's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
In the former Tweet an unfavourable picture of the municipal prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned in April 2013 on the basis of drunkenness on the wheel.
Perry put in a veto against a financial support for her office when she refused to step down, which could lead to a charge against Perry, perhaps in 2016, before a Grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweets is: "I do not always get drunk with the triple permitted alcohol mirror, but if I do it, I will interrupt Governor Perry when he chases it.
I am the most hated democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the study of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, selected by a Republican judge.
He is arguing in favour, not guilty, and calling the prosecution a political trick.
His highly sophisticated team of lawyers requested in the case of the case of reserved judges to expel the prosecution and argued that the law dealing with the president's oldest governor in the history of the State of Texas is unclear.
He has halted $7.5 million of public money to the state's Public Integrity Unit - located in Travis County, and in cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto secured a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perrys official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After having finished as a fifth of his presidential elections in Iowa during his presidential election in 2012, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by bowing to a lake in the vicinity of a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley argues housing market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent planners pointed out that the housing market in south-east England was once again returning to normal levels.
Homes in the capital have been hotly sought-after and subject to enormous price rises, which led the Bank of England to put in place limits on mortgage credit in June, owing to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high class engineer Berkeley said on Monday, "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the maximum level of 2013," and added that this is a "stable performance environment."
The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers went to the capital.
According to information from the Dublin Office, prices in the city area alone rose by 18.5% in the last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average sales prices rose around one-fifth in the past year and amounted to £423,000 at the end of April.
But, in recent months, a stronger pound has made real estate property in London less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "holiday tax" ahead of the general elections in May.
London's real estate broker Foxton warned last week that, in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April, in which a stronger credit regulation was introduced, would result in less market growth, both in real estate sales and at prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a fall in the mortgage loan in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, a different real estate agency, corrected his forecasts for the rise in home prices in London for 2015, down to 3%, on the basis of an already weakening of home prices.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington, has been reduced by a quarter for a year now, according to the broker WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a home in the capital city of Berkeley is a blessing, as the required amounts for futures sales amount to more than $2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year up to the end of April - almost a third more than the peak 2007 in front of the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased by 40 percent to €280 million annually, sales by 18 percent to €1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday prior to the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year is expected to meet the current market expectations.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to 450 million pounds.
Since the afternoon in London's trade fair, fairey stocks were fixed at 23.96.
Naked pictures of Jennifer Lawrence by hackers on the Internet published.
Jennifer Lawrence at the 85th Oscarver.
Naked photos of the actress Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of more than 100 starlets.
A representative of the star "The Tribute von panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were true and bailed the hacker for "flagrant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will persecute all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos taken at the site 4 on the site of Photo-Sharing page were supposedly obtained from Apple's online storage system; the so-called "master list" of the hacking victims includes the so-called "master list" of the hacking victims including the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Wotten, and Mary-Kate Olsen, who reported Buzzfeed.
It is not certain how many of the images are real, although cheers, "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos taken by my husband and me many years ago in the private surrounding of our house - I hope you are so satisfied with you," Wdown wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "Victracts" denied, however, that the photos taken on pictures of her and tweetete "These so-called nuckles of me are fake, people.
We are looking forward to hearing from you!
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop star Ariana Grande reported the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed novel about love and the letter "J."
They bleed, so it was best to be described, they slowly resolved to be like a carton that was left in the rain.
Occasionally, he said to a woman that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distanced from him, and perhaps a bit of scratch.
Then he shook the hands of him.
He knew he was a bit sick.
He was stachelig like in Igel, yes, yes.
The last victim of this frivolity was a starting affair that was more promising to alleviate the lonely boredom of his life, or perhaps even a certain degree of satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a treacherous beauty with uncut hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rough than port.
They came to the south with an older escort, who thought of her aunt, who had inherited a plot in a damp but heavenly valley with the real name Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leck, in the baths were still spiders, neck necks have left their tracks on all windows and believed that they were all that, and the garden was guarded with weed that saw huge carbon heads out.
It was like the house from a children's story, both threatening and attractive, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, his novel "J" on the Longlist for the Man Award 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kentn had been dressed with Ailinn on the broken deck chairs in the high grass to eat and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, both of which were able to be escorted into the service desk in the service desk, who gave the land with calcareous music and smiling messages, as the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, who had been listening to his father at closed roller blinds in the House.
Your feet are too great.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this style were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was so strictly prohibited - simply did not play.
It has been rendered obsolete, as is the word obsolete.
The general taste, leaving nothing and rules could never have been achieved and, like people in books, select the vom-Teller's 500 male memoirs, cookery books, and love romane, they voted for the music of the balloons.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to rehearse large feet in a great vibe.
Ailinn understood this not.
"That was a famous song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he declared her and put two fingers on his lips.
He had always done his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a match between him and his father when he was still small.
His father played it with his own father, he told him.
If you start a word with a J without touching your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was not very funny at the time, so it was not very funny at the time.
He knew that was all that was expected of him.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of it.
Jazz, even if it was not strictly prohibited, did not play.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to start a melody quite sure where they would end.
There is also reason.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically wavering mind.
Although he was ten years old, without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew nothing about jazz from the half-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he had to declare Ailinn that Fat was black.
At her age, she could not remember a period in which the pop singer was not black.
Again, not laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the group's principle - grateful to those of fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origins were able to play for entertainment and sport through temperament and body construction.
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent, were blessed as by nature with electronic talent, and were looked after with the task of ensuring that no family had remained in service.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks was crumbling.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levante, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, had happened to WAR, WHAT WAR, WHAT WAR, fear of being charged with fear of being charged with fire, fearing that the flames they would eat as next, took account of and have been depressed with inaction.
Each according to their skills.
As she had heard only ballads, Ailinn felt hard to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung had to be made more expensive.
Music was an expression of love.
"Those are not really insulting," said Kentn.
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He remored too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon sheets.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why should your father should have liked this?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated to put his finger at the lips in their presence.
She already thought it was rather strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head and locked her eyes.
There was nothing else to look at all over the world than their unspeakable raben black hair.
There was nothing he would have wanted to see.
"If you say it, I do not believe it.
But that does not explain why you put it before me.
It seemed to be honest.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet so easily not.
Perhaps your ankles, a little bit of a little more!
And you say you hate me, because my ankles are too thick?
You hate?
Of course, I do not hate you.
That is just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but for that it was too early.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you are getting me wrong," he tried it instead.
I am a bit perverted here.
That did not sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often encountered difficulties, because he did not have the reassuring charm he had in his father who needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted, Kevern, who would be.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was red and rose out of their deckchair, threw the console around and buried the wine they had drunk.
High quality wine, so drunkenness was not an excuse for him.
In their excitement, she seemed to tremble, such as palahel in the storm.
"And your thick head is precisely why I feel pervers to thee," she said.
Except that I am not.
She was sorry, both because of the uneasiness of his words and of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she opposed him.
Did she think he would beat them?
She did not tell him about the life on the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and shallow ocean, like there, erupted here on the bank.
The same puzzling men, with even more thick skin and driverable after the WHAT WAR when they had their ancestors as their ancestors than they had their ancestors called the smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to hand over a woman who refused or curbed.
The head of the head?
They would have shown a great deal if they did not fix it!
It's the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the empty love ball from the console - they hit them and then beat them.
According to Keeler's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the muddle was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign from her body to be a sign.
He rose from a deckchair like an old man.
She also felt bound, but the force of his grief surprised them.
That was not the end of the world.
They were barely aware of it.
He saw him as he departed - just like a room on the top floor of her companion - a man complained by something he himself called for.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some hand had risen against them.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, ashamed, defeated, without a combat spirit - why was it a sight that she appeared to be well acquainted with when she could not remember once again that she had seen her before today?
When she was back alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Many years before the events that have just been heard, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for the public sentiment, in a short talk about continuing violence at a low and medium level in precisely those parts of the country, in which, if not abolition, were most likely to be expected, in view of the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence, were to be expected.
"It has already been done a lot, and much has yet to be done, "wrote it," to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people, which fought a thousand wars and gained most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys in the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness historically seen, despite the high-spirited arch towers between the hedges, it is rare.
But some characteristics are proving to be unmanageable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to evoke.
The population is crying for listening to sentimental balloons, alluding to stories about forgotten problems and claims to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but still not only keeps the old blanche of rural communities as well as our urban fabric in the hands, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and deardent dispute about home, in the workplace, on the roads, and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said their mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest that you read fewer novels.
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you Atheist?
'I do not believe that I have to say this,' replied to ESME Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, ESME is entitled to privacy and denial of the statement.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I do not question that," said Luther Rabinowitz finally, "because I would be against Atheism, Lesbentum, or feminism.
This is a non-partisan job.
We serve a non-partisan society.
However, certain types of hypersensitivity, which are in itself entirely acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort the results you have presented.
They obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "underhand" and "roh" may be interpreted as a matter of strength and vitality from others as well.
If there is going to be on the way ahead, WHAT happened, WHAT did happen, as if, if it had happened, it would have happened yesterday to take the country out of its essential vitality.
ESME Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head repeated an LED label in flamingorosa the advice that Ofnow had granted to the country in the last quarter-century or longer.
Surprise your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, you speak, listen to, vote to vote, excuse me.
Speaking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I can understand absolutely absolutely what you want to do," answered ESME Nussbaum with a quiet voice when she was sure that she had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing other than that we have not yet been treated as effectively as we are deluding ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we shall be able to find out how we repeat the mistakes that were made at the time not in the case of WHAT, WHAT N ES, in fact.
This time, however, it is not the others where we leave our anger and distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to interpret this as an angel.
"They go too far," he said," when you refer to actions as "errors" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They go too far when you say that these "anger" and their "distrust" have left their mark on "others."
It should not, in fact, be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are not talking about "us" and "others" in understanding the past, such as the protection of the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that is everything we know.
"If we are honest with ourselves, if we are honest with ourselves, "must not claim to be a part of society that have behaved well.
There is no one in my mind.
Whether it has been done badly or well has happened.
That was then.
There is nothing more to be said about this - there we are in agreement.
And, just as it is not to be blamed, it must not be blamed if such eradication is appropriate and if there is a way to eradicate it.
But to what is the past if we do not learn from it -
The past is something we do not want to forget.
If I may say something about this, I should like to say something about this.
Luther Rabinowitz brought down his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said, he made it.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was driven by a motorcycle driver who described, as passersby described, on a walk in a kind of "brute rage."
There are incidents.
Leskova's military member says there is no coup d'état; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Official officials from the military in Lesotho tended to have planned a coup d'état to overthrow the government and said they were against police accused of armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and informed that the army of the country occupied his seat of residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighboring South Africa after he reported attacks on attacks.
Military spokespersons Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is de facto no coup d'état, but that the military is responding to the threat posed by "political fanatics" whose arming was in the hands of the police.
"what happened this morning was that, after having received several intelligence reports, the Staff of the Defense Forces of Lesotho were able to act within the police to act on a number of elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party political young fanatics who were quick to do so," he said, "he said to the Voice of America.
The South African government spokesperson, Clayson Monyela, said that military action took the impression of a crash.
"Even if no one claims to have taken the government through violence, no one has agreed that the actions taken by the defence forces of Lesotho so far show signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Speakers from the military in Lesotho agreed on Sunday that the soldiers would return to their barracks, and that the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the Vice remier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the governance of Thabanes's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become the target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been major tensions since June, after Russia's parliamentary sessions turned out to be in its unity government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, despite the fact that he was opposed.
Production in the euro zone on a 13-month pitch
The increase in GDP growth in August slowed to the lowest point of the last 13 months, such as a study carried out exactly.
The final Markit Shopping Management Index of the manufacturing sector (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, at a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 gives an expansion.
New orders went back and factories hit in a period of rising tension between the EU and Russia on Ukraine.
The figures meet before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets are looking for a clear plan to deal with a reluctant recovery of the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that, in the course of this week, the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information on whether it is considering quantitative easing for the euro zone, in accordance with those carried out by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although growth is better than no growth, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more evident to manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The FabricPMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, the second largest economic nation in the bloc, France, turned to 46.9 on PMI.
France remains a problem, as is the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in key industrial mechanics Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands no longer apply, are also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts expecting more monetary or fiscal stimulus.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the Chief Business Engineer at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the retail trade index in the eurozone from August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "The eurozone's producers are obviously very difficult at the moment, as the current elevated geopolitical tensions, especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine, increase uncertainty in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, in particular, and consumer confidence, and is likely to cause some of the missions to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that 'increasingly likely' is that the ECB will eventually have to start a kind of QE, "although we suspect that it will be limited."
The spectacle of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in question are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people from Chechen militias were taken hostage in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of children, were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims that have escaped death in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school in which 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
As fanatical Islamist terrorists killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the start of a new fiscal year, that seemed to be like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into disgust, and then turned surprisingly in action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims that have escaped death in the classroom.
We found surprising young people that have overcome resistance, even though the memory of these terrorist hell is going to keep them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that Ukraine is now seeking - and it is dying in children - is coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed at the trial to climb back to the crumbling school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Besakow, when she tried to go back to the wrecked school sports hall after an explosion was exploding.
Aida looked for her mother Larissa, she was 40 years old.
Both were deemed dead, but they survived.
"A woman said to me to race my life, but I could not," said Aida that time.
My legs were radiated.
I stood up and climbed back to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them in safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I am afraid I have to be working again.
Some grenades are still in my knees.
Their aim is to become dentistry to help the people, as they have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not break me," she says.
"This is what happened to me, and that is something you cannot change.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remind myself of those who have stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed of going to school.
"I do not want to marry until I start my studies and start my career.
I think about a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of her, despite the memory of every year becoming somewhat weaker.
I am glad that many people in the world are still reminded of our horror and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
If I see online the photo of me, as I go back to school, I think that many people think for the first time, understand our disaster and help make this not happen again.
The boy, who fled through the ball, in opinion that his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (Russians went to school for seven years) and survived the triday siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old he said: 'Mama told me to lay down when there was an explosion and keep her hand.'
After an explosion, he thought that she would die.
She said to him: "Run."
With fear that they could be dead, he fled and saw the way a crying infant, took it at the hand and fled through a ball hagel.
His father, Vladimir, who closed his son outside the arms, said: "Damir said to me that his mother died.
He said: "I could not save them."
In fact, Tamara was screwed out outside, and with grave injuries in the hospital, for their part, in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunification she said: "I am crying for joy.
I could not believe it.
He started to play and hug me.
Damir was flown to London in the meantime (from the now dissolved Newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Kids Champion by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is going on every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is colored in my memory.
I still know that I threw away all my toy pistols straight away.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember those children with whom I played in the courtyard, and they did not manage to do it.
We never say that they have been killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially to the toy shop where I could choose what I wanted, and the ride in an above open car.
But now he is afraid of location, such as Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends have suffered.
This horror is going on every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me.
"I am so sorry about all those who suffer under the Greuds," said Damir who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I will be happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and I hope they will take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: '37 children from our neighbourhood have been killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children able to walk and this quiet lasted for many months.
She reminds me vividly about her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London were crying when I told our story.
At that time, I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
It was grateful to Cherie Blair and her Foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and her simply saying that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting for me and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped me.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borshsch, calling them all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant.
And that was only one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, 'I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is going on, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are precisely such children as ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or have something else.
I simply know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I cannot stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people want to kill each other and that's sad.
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know he does not like to remind him, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and ignite the candles there.
When he was smaller, he was suffering from it - I remember him sometimes on the sofa put his face from us for hours.
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
I still remember him again how he continued his arms and other military toys; Damir is now 17, bigger than me, good looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I have been so sure for a few hours that he is dead and never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my feet after the explosion, I saw myself, and saw the hell around me, running around body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could survive in this hell impossible.
"I remember that I said to him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he has gone away.
This is how life goes on life, unlike that of many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible picture after the siege has been the symbol of Beslan's abominations
Comfort: The bestseller Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right on an image of Georgij today
His blood-overflowing face was drawn from fear when he burnt his life while Chechen terrorists beat his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a health care professional, called him for his first day of school, before they rushed to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not entirely, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer the date approaches, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day on which we remember this tragedy.
We do not think it is long ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are watching me forever.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Strong: The picture of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school on this day, saying he said he wanted to reduce his teacher.
I knew only that he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the wine-born Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also believe that, thanks to this picture, people throughout the world feel our pain.
Georgij today says: "It is important that this never happens again.
"I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused him?
This world is becoming a bit horrific.
"I cannot understand how it is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, how is it going?
Ten years has nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For three or four years I had a few nightmares for the siege, but then it was better.
I went to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That is why I always go to the sports hall when 1 September is closer.
I shall pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It is hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I must do it.
I do not feel a victim, this history is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not paint.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I am going to become a cardiologist.
My first choice was to train in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not do that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it will not happen.
Georgij Faniev, 20
The boy who survived, despite being caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist.
A miracle: Georgij fanatics were trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was fixed on the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is truly a miracle that he has not been killed.
"We feel it, as if it were yesterday, "says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as intelligence officer, but this was not able to do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, there is nothing I have left behind me.
I am now older and people say that children can easily be treated with terrible experiences - I have to say that this is not true.
"I worked with psychologists in 2006, but I felt a bit better after that, but I cannot forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time that I returned to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back to this again and ask me not to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Living: Georgij Faniyev today, with a photograph of in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is terrible, and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about them, and they never asked me about the school.
Physically speaking, I think it is good.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can go well now.
However, because of my health, I could not study the FSB in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I have submitted my documents, the medical authorities, and they have replied that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been behind me for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this, nor should they, of course, suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse if the anniversary is closer.
I shall be commemorating the celebrations of remembrance.
I know that Georgij is not going to go.
It must be much more intense for him because he was there and I did not.
I waited at home on him and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is hard to accept that if something is so unfair.
He is a boy, he loves sport, but he cannot join him because of his knees.
He has been operating several times, he can run, but it is not a sport.
I would say that it has overcome the horror of 50%, but can never be completely overcome and forgotten.
We are always watching this terrible experience.
Many friends and neighbors were killed at the siege, and this only reinforces my pain.
I lost many people who I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me but my heart is crying for the people.
I know of families in which new children have been born, but also of widows who never again have married.
It is hard to accept that life continues, even if we do not want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped to me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can hardly believe it.
We have been a friendly country in the past, how can we fight now that we are fighting?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and that many are still being killed.
If only all these rebels can attack and postpone them, they can go as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, which was so connected to safety by a special command in safety?
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is safely brought to safety by a Russian Special Command Command (left).
It is now ten (right).
The world stopped in 2004 when the Baby Aljona was worn in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty they held their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has been married since then, and with his new wife Swetlana a little girl has called him after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown to an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that mark the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or videos in water, there is a selection of devices.
The most expensive option is a waterproof Point And-Shoot such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action Cam such as the GoPro Hero3+Silver edition, both of which are for about $300.
I have taken these photos at a family home with several cameras, all available at a price of $350.
Irrespective of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other items are closed.
Place your camera on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders are equipped with the scene and recording memodi to optimize exposure times for vulnerable underwater conditions.
And before you jump, check the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras are allowed only for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the reviews on digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many cannot be folded down.
Point-and--Shoot-cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it under water and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a serial mode to make a series of shots with slightly modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, the more you will remove from the surface.
If possible, therefore, you stay close to the surface if you make shots in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to put more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go to the objects close to the camera.
This is a good advice on land, but it is all the more important because of the poor light.
It is particularly important when working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you have to connect to your objects in more depth when they are required to complete the whole picture boxes.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization like the NHS.
As a consultative anaesthesia, he devoted his career to the task of sparing the sick both the agony of the disease, as well as the suffering of treatment.
Among his patients, so his wife remembers, was a MI6 worker who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important for diagnoses and diseases, while the treated people mostly deal with something else: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began his pathway.
"I did not feel myself," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulty trying to catch me out.
While fighting with the grippelike symptoms, he remarked that he was impatient to his wife, Juliet.
"I'd rather call it immediately than later," he replied.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt very uncomfortable and not worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he was in the French Alps for skiing.
The results of the X-ray inspection were available.
He suffered from mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, which affects the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is difficult to determine.
For example, for some smokers of lung cancer, not all lung cancer has been smokers in the past.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building which, once considered as a "miracle substance," was considered to be fatal.
For most of us, mesotheliom is a disease that can easily be ignored.
After all, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the industry voluntarily committed not to use it.
Here, too, where it was used, only people in specific sectors worked directly with the substance - plumbers, construction workers, carpeting and shipyard workers.
As an industrial hazardous material from another period, it now seems almost to be a source of concern.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, will be at the height of a Mesoltheliom-epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.
Annual figures for Mesothelicoke cases since 1980 and probable future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, despite the fact that asbestos has been illegal for years, is that a mesotheliom is only developed after decades.
And the scourge of the mesotheliom is not confined to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we are working, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore, Mesotheliom knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protection room.
Parliament building is dangerously contaminated.
Even in hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy, they have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogens.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber either.
Indeed, it was hard to imagine where he might be in contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks as though in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I spent six years of my training, a lot of asbestos was present," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and Pförtner - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my contemporaries will suffer the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"From the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital, and who have suffered from Mesotheliom in the past five years, he wrote in a letter "I'm the last that still lives."
How many of us will become ill?
At Andrew Lawson Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55th.
This has been an unusually long period of survival.
Fifty percent of all trade patients die in a period of 8 months after the diagnosis.
The disease always ends in death.
We can therefore just repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will become ill?"
The UK's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that, between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is likely to end in the UK, there will be a total of 90.000 of the disease.
Most of them still have no idea that they will die.

A brief glance at the files of the courts, to which the victims often refer to claims for compensation, shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioms is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, have, for example, caused asbestos to be exposed to asbestos in Janice.
She worked for nine years for the chain from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them of the flagship store at Oxford Street.
She was only 18 years old when she began her career at M & S.
Now it has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing, "she says," I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I did not really know anything about asbestos yet.
I never thought that would affect me this time.
There are few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance but a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "ashang," a description of the fibre structure that makes fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six have been used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof panels, flooring panels, pipe insulations, boom insulation, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos but it is still regarded by the EU and the WHO as a "big health risk" with possible death.
However, dangerous is the brown asbestos (amsit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear, but indirect, that this was a main reason for the unique high mesothelize."
A team of Marks & Spencer was exposed in the flagship store at Oxford Street, London, asbestos at Alamy.
Janice Allen may not seem to be seen as a typical mesothelize, but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their history is by no means unusual.
He has submitted a study by the interested parties to indicate that "a significant proportion of the mesotheliome without a known suspension of work, or in the House, was caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Much of this contact is based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like nobody can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which investigated the palace of Westminster, shows, as people in the very heart of the government, could have been exposed to the substance in the face of the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service holes and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos from Parliament's committees, whose deadly fibers could be swallowed up by something like "strong air movements."
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the West Minster Palace had received a "clean health certificate," there is no doubt that 1 billion £1 billion must be found to renovate Parliament over several years to renovate Parliament, to modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, the Members will be more likely to meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the Green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that 'the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the relevant rules'.
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
Everything you can do is wait.
A person who has never been able to determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
As Andrew Lawson suspects the 50 year-old Abbott that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital in which the complaint was decided in a positive way," he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remind yourself of all the places you have worked on and the data.
What he is reminded of is the day of the beginning of December 2009, in which he got some kind of fever.
He was 45, and was running an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had been shaking.
It suddenly came.
I felt terrible.
I thought not to make the trip to the home any more.
As a doctor knew Abbott that the pain of the breast skin, the skin around his lungs, touched.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He did not go a month to work.
At the beginning of the 20th century, it was the first time that the company was able to take over its breast and put Pleurakathether to test fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without any diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his job.
From time to time, however, the symptoms turned back, often after sporty action and severe breathing.
In 2011 a patient came Abbott with similar symptoms in his practice and later was diagnosed with Mesotheliom.
But Abbott also does not do this with his own case.
After all, his patient was some decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's state deteriorated and his doctor brought his CT-Sids and X-rays into a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera fitted with a camera was inserted into the cave between the reef and the chest.
I am an optimist.
I usually simply go on," he says.
To be honest, I did not have much to worry about.
But Rachel, my wife, was concerned.
The result of biopsy lay during the week between Christmas and New Year: "You told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had a meeting with Macmillan nurses, who recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now is the concept of the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings, in which pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now contracting.
This is how Mesotheliom hits younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos in hospitals were placed beneath the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
However, many staff that moved into pedestrian tunnels from a building into other (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteen (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely to be in contact with the toxic substances.
It is apparent that for several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving, but life-threatening for the doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students showed their capillary distillers on asbestos mats.
And it does not just concern hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its fabulous insulating and flamboyant properties.
Schools, too.
Indeed, many people probably have had the first instance in the classroom in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of chemical engineers, students have turned their cabs on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now often referred to in schools.
And, meanwhile, such innocent objects in our houses, such as floor tiles or slippers, contain asbestos.
"It is an industrialist that is in large parts of our real estate," commented Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact among an affected woman was the demolition of a garden mill in the 1970" s.
So adjust to how to tear your garden kiln away.
The effects of the diagnosis and the knowledge that the disease is incurable is immense.
"It takes a while to read," says Graham Abbott.
I went to work and tried to continue to make, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and had to take care of myself.
Well, I am not going to see another Christmas festival.
With the greatest difficulty the change in perspective was from the position of a doctor to one patient.
Like countless patients in front of him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was from all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to include everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor "how long have I still?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought "Well, I will not see another Christmas festival.
That was 'to be the case'.
Mesotheliom is particularly treacherous because it is our life support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of small fibres.
When the asbestos is raised and the fibres inhaled, they can be fixed in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises from the inhaled nadelike asdensic fibers, "" says Professor Tom Treasure, a Heart Thorax physician, who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects that it is exposed to asbestos, is, ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
Once the asbestos adges reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, they will be pushed to the edge of the breathing process where the skin is.
From nature, it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well in mesotheliom.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly contested.
Some say that they are worth trying.
Treasure deny that.
"You cannot cut the chest coat," he says.
They do not go with the knife around them.
Meanwhile, the cancer does not say very well "the effect of chemotherapy," but does not heal.
"Sometimes, there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But, in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live far longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after its own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After having contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and advisory office for contributors to his diagnosis four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he called happily on calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which lasted four months and is expected to be prolonged only for one month.
'I was desperate,' he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Sarah managed to let things appear in a more positive light."
After the consultation of several physicians, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunsky, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage that I did not need to be called, I simply called and got an appointment," gives Graham to.
A normal patient would have to receive a bank transfer and have to wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is critical to mesotheliom-sufferers in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But when these treatments eventually fail, many people are affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It is known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that a very low risk was also a health risk.
And here the carelessness of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually found their case, but it was not what Morgan called "full compensation," because Lawson could not prove absolute safety that his mesothelioma was due to an asthma contact with Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy's, confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed from the 1990" s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson to be late.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesotheliom-sufferers who are trying to compensate for compensation, a huge problem, namely the fatal symptoms of a company or a job - typically decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there have been strong new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesotheliom-sufferers to redress, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has established a $350 million fund sponsored by the insurance industry, which was diagnosed after July 2012, but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiff received 80% of what a court could have received in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 pounds.
About 300 successful applications in the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan believes, like so many mesothelim, that 350 million £was a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurer for insurers, "he says, and suggests that this amount is around a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time had not gone about them and that mesotheliom-sufferers could find and run normal.
In addition, the law "not perfect" is said to Mike Peacing, who was a senior employer of labor and pension affairs.
But both pacts and Morgan have said that, in the face of seven deaths daily, we need to act quickly.
"The people are suffering so much and need help today," said Peaning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom-law in December of last year.
At this point, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that expected a positive effect, contrary to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a tripod therapy with which long-Lazdunsky can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
This is always the case with patients.
There is something you can continue to do.
If you go on, you will get worse off very quickly.
Graham Abbott filed for the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he was behind the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Rantures showed no sign of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There have been several cancers around my chest.
I have been just 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That is vital.
Abbott again withdrew six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no trace of the tumor more visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very exhausting.
They must think about practical things - about the money, if I am no longer, for example, or my wife, how the boom time function works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
They must be looking forward.
As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents it is hard, he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girl that I would have a disease with which I would not be old.
They responded very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and unobtrusive.
She told her her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more cautious.
It did not say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients need to pass through.
But for mesothelized patients, such talks are not driven by hope, not of a trace of hope for survival.
The disease, like the end of Stephen Jay Gould, leads to gridded security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China is denying Hong Kong right to government elections, demonstrators swear vengeance
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increase in calls for democratic reform, against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate.
It is likely that this would be the long awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists began to plan and mobilize within less than a few hours after the announcement.
The decision of the People's Congress of the People's Congress allows the communist leaders in principle to reject all those who are not in charge.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said Legal expert Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong were lying.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of China's decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominees in the Hong Kong Government elections would be "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain withdrew control of Hong Kong, Beijing has promised to allow the residents of 2017 to elect the government.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives Hong Kong's citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that China's leaders are keeping a firm hold on the process through a nominating committee controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates would be allowed "with love to land and love to Hong Kong."
The decision is followed by a summer in which some of Hong Kong's largest and most popular protests have been held in Hong Kong for many years.
Behind the Hong Kong pro-democracy campaign, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to kill off the financial district, if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday evening, in a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters gathered in the rain before the government's capital district in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had achieved a new level of civil disobedience and that they planned protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any information on this, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers informed the organizers that the motion was only considered as a last resort, an action that only takes place when all the chances of dialogue are exhausted and no other choice exists.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the district county will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days and there were tighter security measures, including police forces and barricades on Sunday, in front of the government building.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to crumble under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy-Central-Movement demonstrations, as they are threatening business operations - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protests from which they speak may cause major economic damage, depending on how many have been involved and how long it lasts,' he said Legal expert Regine Ip, who has been critical of the movement for a long time.
We do not want to worry about Hong Kong being out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also reported recently about pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong than Western powers controlled by subversive agents.
This summer activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people took part - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the biggest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school leavers in the US is transferred to the universities where fresh performances are offered to the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxury travel service in Britain for today's students.
In order to be able to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said that the service provided a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to have their belongings transported across the country by the country.
Together with our new VIF options, this year we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A business speaker said that there are no new bookings yet, since the service was only introduced, but added that "students can book the service in the next weeks."
The company also informed that, despite the tuition fees of £9,000 a year, it would expect a market for this offer.
Students today differ in their expectations and demands from the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can precisely.
However, the National Student Union was critical of the service itself.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems to be completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who are beginning to study this month are facing a crisis of living costs, as the available financial support in the form of credit and scholarships does not keep up with the sharply rising bills for the most basic basic of life, before they can even think of killing thousands of pounds for such a thing as the arrival of the student residence in the student residence.
Feminists criticize race and police behavior to Ferguson.
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., at the beginning of this month.
The participants took their hands in the air and sang, "hands high, not shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown noticed the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez an amendment to the online discussion white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender into the race when it comes to raising reproductive rights and income inequality.
While tensions in the Middle West grew and received attention throughout the country, Perez looked at the responses from white women to 100% around the race.
In comparison with the answers of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "ideas on Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the suppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I do not believe in feminism that finds many people talking about the white and privileges in such a high class, 'he said.
People felt compelled to say something about the incidents.
It is typical of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they must express it.
For English professor Coritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University, Ferguson brought down problems that black American women are exposed to every day, but they are not considered to be 'women's issues' in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partners and get 150 turns from everywhere, "said Mitchell.
When I say something about how Farlife is under siege in her own country, silence is deafening.
"How can women be sure to speak in public about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the issues; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender in feminist mainstream constituencies, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, tells us that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 to 1890, at least 10,000 black men were jailed and the explanation was almost always the rape of a white woman, "said Hattery.
White women have had to take part in history to justify the lynch.
For Hattery came the division between white and black women at the point, to the white fighter for women's choice, as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century, and found that the battle for the right to vote could only be successful only for one group: Women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's voting rights, and the right to vote for black should come later, "said Hattery.
When you remind yourself of such things, one is aware of the fact that coloured women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to be organized against the lynx in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request to help pages black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues that have been raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - a mirror of the time in which white feminists have played "cheats" with the problems that black women have been fighting for generations for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who built their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means try to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steiner spent two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a posite article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist of the Guardian, calling for more protests from white Americans on the issue of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a threat inherent to the body - and opinion on race, which is clearly different in public polls - that will lead to change," wrote Steiner.
Although there is talk of a more intersectional feminism, in which racial, as well as gender issues, are addressed, some of her comments on the racial issue in America are perplexed.
Christina Sommer, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole Feminism?" he said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young coloured men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Stone's comments on Ferguson, in contrast to their earlier criticisms.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But as the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and hispanic men, there have been annoying reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem with the emphasis of mainstream feminist politics.
After US border police hit almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's south-west border this year, the subject of immigration reform is also turning to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as a fundamental women's issue, they simply must publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of immigrant workers go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate in the women's organisations," she said.
"Pig-Haus" in Ipswich stands for sale.
The picture of a house that was sold has been removed from real estate agents, when it became clear that there was a large sponge that it had done in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is available for 120,000.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - to which a pig was also a member that had put his head on a sofa.
Real estate broker Connells said that the pig in the photo was the owner of the owner.
"The photo was, however, erroneously published and has since been removed "said a speaker of the company.
In the exposé of the House, Connells described the former collection as an "unique single-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the site, it will still appear on promotional material.
The house sales generated in the social media interest, as some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SWCITY Harvey is based after lotto win a new millionaire.
This month the Lottoplayer from Harvey is this month.
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth lasts, with a lucky winner, who receives almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey for the second time in five years shot the jackpot in the drawing of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, must report.
The shopkeeper Steve Forward said that the advantage for talking material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing, and all are quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA-winners have held prizes in the first division in the last month, an appropriate conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week a player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had previously achieved the megaprofit of $7.5 million just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the profit allows them the chance of a world trip and a purchase of a new house.
The millionaire of Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas asked for the gladiatorial arena
It is not only the gladiators who have been standing in the park for the first time at the first Rheinbacher RömerDay in the park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday.
There was a colourful friction of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information on the Roman era and its importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martiean fighter group from the gladiatorial school "Amor Mortis," who used every rain break to demonstrate their robust combat of combat in the arena with soft sand.
Gladiator-owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men to the ring for the heroic two-battle in various gladiators.
First the "Provocators" were on the row with a rectangular shield and a short tail, as well as leg rail on the left leg and the armchair at the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with breast shield, short shearrings, and iron gladiator helm, bass and armrest.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiro arius," which with worm network, trizack and dagger turned against the "Secutor" and, after a short while ago, joined the burgers to the ground.
Because of this the gravity of the swords, the shields and the shrines floated through the arena, that a fear and bange could be used to protect the health of the gladiators.
But on the one hand the impressive "Summa Rudis," the muscular arbitrator, is always an eye on the eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman life and to experience the Roman era," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the "Friends of the Roman Canal," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation time, a "Oppidum Romanum," a Roman city for a day, was said to be a Roman city, as was pointed out in his greeting word by the chair of Claus Claus Claus.
After all, the Romans did not only bring about war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and many constructions that we still admire today.
The remains of these were also found on the Roman day, such as "aqueduct-marble" from the eleven metre-high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridge that was once at ventilation.
The frontinus-society once and now confronted the water supply and energy supply and now, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge at that time today."
This also confirms engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "Engineering Team Two" of Rheinbach, the surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 and brick bricks from the original hypothills, which were once the Roman villa.
Impressive also the shots taken from Wolf and Fuchs, two millennia ago, before they were burnt.
In 2011, the Regional Association of Rhineland-Palatinate had excavated the remains of a Roman villa at the Nord in Rheinbach Industrial Park.
I found a bridge of an economic building with a Darre found for drying grain and smelling.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, a agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass box, including a big plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa has probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ until the arrival of the Germanen in the then Roman Rhineland, apparently Morscheiser.
For her, the children also worked with the Roman windmill game, similar to the current pace game, or they wrote like once the Roman students their names with metal masks on wax boards.
At the time of the Roman thermal moam I was allowed to lay mosaics at the booth of the Glass Museum Rheinbach glass mosaic and use a heavy wheat mill from Stein at the stand of the Nature Centre Eifel Nettersheim in order to grind the flour for a bread or a cereals.
The visitors through the amusement park led to the visitors through the amusement park of two cold blossoms, as well as the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented here the results of their "Römer-project-twochen."
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the village of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Ruhr-far-rested Roman year 2014, which is supposed to commemorate Emperor Augustus' s death in 2000 years ago.
Together with their home and historical friends as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Association, the association and the "Oberbachem" group, these include thematic hikes, a lecture, cookery evenings and guided tours for school classes, and remind you of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary is told by his work on the corresponding watchtberg that he presents plants as living monuments of the Roman period and offered a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germanen" and invited Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is devoted to the Roman theme as part of a project study.
With the Roman Weeks the many, often but no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, will be made available again.
At the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will be reminiscent of the Fund of the Bercumhe Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic was burdened by West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned and international companies go on distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic has caused a severe blow to West Africa's economy.
The harvest is rotated in fields, mines are left and the markets orphaned - the virus has been severely constrained by the region.
Even some international companies are already at distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," said the boss of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit.
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, sold on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
On the market only who wants to buy food or something to disinfect at Ebola can come to the market.
Liberia is hit hardest by the virus, alone in this case, with more than 600 deaths.
Recently, health authorities said that the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country.
In Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, too, the virus spread.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died, and thousands of others have joined.
Foreign Companies Take employees from
Companies operating in resource-rich countries use their business.
Foreign companies, such as the Arcelor Mittal steel group, attract their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also responding: Few merchants still leave their homes to obtain supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, these include, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for harvesting.
Foodstuffs are going to be nearly under way?
"People are going to be less travelling," says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert for West Africa's economy.
The man, for example, who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables, remains at home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic direct and urgent: Food is going to be scarce.
In the markets, supplies of basic foodstuffs such as rice are disappearing.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatening an image - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies would rule out the area for a long time, Philippe Hugon said by the French thinker tank Iris.
The decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will spread.
In the case of investors, the impression is created that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and thus also to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the hard-pressed national budgets of the Member States.
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the countries concerned.
The credit rating agency Moody's fears that its budgets are heavily strained by high spending on the health system and, in addition, of the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank promised to help health systems in the countries affected to EUR 60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are already felt in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people remain in fear of contagion at home.
Reservations in hotels can also be traced back to the hotel.
Protect celebrate Your 50th Jubilee
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
For the 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September, the Tannenwald team is working hard for you.
Scheduled is scheduled on Friday, September 12th, a great evening with the "Dorfrocker" group.
On Saturday at 6 pm the big Bon shoot.
Then, in the big tent of the mood night with the "Stoapcounterfeizer top buam."
Brass band adds to the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festival service at 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the great feast at 2 pm.
In the afternoon is also the price allocation of the Federal and Gauvent.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 Festdamen with their dirndln.
Festkapelle is the brass band Berngau.
The patron was taken over by the Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the society was founded on 21 March by the association for "social entertainment" through exercise in the entrance of indoor and outdoor fire prices."
The Nazi regime had led to the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964, 19 young men have been found, who, on April 30 in Gasthaus Lukas, have founded the "new" protégé "Tannenwald" Berngau.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the association as protectors through a difficult starting time in which it was mainly concerned to find a local club and to install the firing range.
In the fall of 1965 the Schützenverein started in the "Leininger" inn with two teams in the lap competitions.
In the following years, the sports, which have been organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauleague.
The club recorde purges each year and the magic boundary of 380 rings has been achieved by Rudi Meier for the first time in 1980.
As well as the efficiency of the active protectors have increased, the membership figures have also been positive.
After the club "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern protectorate, the then Executive Board, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future residence in the cellar rooms of the new Landgasthof Härteis.
After a work performance of 2700 hours, the priest's blessing was granted to the new protectors on 8 May 1988 for the new trenches.
One of the great highlights in the history of association was certainly the 44th Gaushoot, coupled with the solemn presentation of the new protector flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a group of judges was set up.
Josef Schmalzl was a Böller-referent.
A big challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the focus of the Bavarian Bon meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the club members modernised the rooms and the firing range at the Berngauer Hof last year to bring them up to date with technology.
Eleven teams in lap competitions
You can also see the sporting achievements of the Schützenverein.
At the moment, eleven teams take part in the lap competitions: Six air forces teams, an air gun crew, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two watt teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Keller, rose in the league league 1 in the round 2013/14.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml have risen from the Gauleague North to the Gautops league.
In addition to the shooting sport, there have been events such as bockouts, carnival and royal ball, association and Christmas party tradition.
With this you will also be able to use the festivals in parish and parish.
Tony Stewart suffers from accident at a return to the race track.
Tony Steward's return to the race track ended roughly halfway through his race on the Atlanta engine Speedway.
Stewart drove for the second time against the wall, after his right front ripped in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car to the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that his 14 team team is disappointed, but will now be focusing on the races in Richmond, Virginia, on the coming weekend.
"I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We drive to Richmond and hope that we can do it better there.
Stewart had a collision with Kyle Busch earlier on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch in a wall and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I have entered into a good result today with very good hopes, "he said," he said, and added: "It did not work." It did not work."
Not long after the second accident was loaded Stewarts car in the slugs and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart made three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met and killed a fellow driver in the North of New York.
He decided to go back this week to win in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond in order to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his place of investigation, during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20th century Kevin Ward Jr., which was placed on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities informed on Friday that research into the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
There is no decision about whether Stewart must reckon with a charge.
The triple champion was received with great applause when he was presented in front of the race.
At the beginning of the 12th position, Stewart had already penetrated the first 10 and was temporarily placed on space four.
After a reboot in round 122, bushs came into being.
Cars with No 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both of which drove against the wall.
Stewart continued, but dropped to place 21.
We have been looking for talented young people.
Simply try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) look forward to working together.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups can also be brought to the secondary schools in the TV Jahn.
After the summer holidays some groups have been decimated.
Now we are looking for young people to be looking for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In both jazz and modernism groups of Lisa Neitzel, as dancer in the jazz and Modern Dance-formation "Spirits," are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years, six in the group of 12 - 15 years," tells the 20-year-old.
With more actives it would make it much more fun, "you could dance very different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, go on Thursdays between 17 and 18: 00 or on Friday between 17 and 18: 00 on Friday between 17 and 18: 00 at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
"The training begins regularly with a warm-up program," explains the trainer.
Various choreographies are then taken into consideration.
Jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore, classical to sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course also the conviviality does not come too short.
"We go to dinner, watch dance films and we have also stayed in the dancing room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and still do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don't like jazz, you can also take part in one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and teenagers can always take part in lessons in children's tanz/jazz dance, Bambini-Ballett, videoclip dancing and hip-hop into the classroom.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you are interested in Discofox, long-running Walzer, Viennese Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can take a look and join.
The Women's Fathers of Mormon protest across the country
Hundreds of prison officers from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Justice Meeting in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.

NATO wants Negotiations with Russia
NATO will not break off its agreement with Russia due to the planned closures in Eastern Europe due to the Ukrainian crisis.
NATO's Secretary-General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said in Brussels on Monday, that NATO is committed to the founding agreement of the NATO NATO Council of 1997.
The NATO leader, however, accused Russia of "a stark coup" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
From documents and statements from Russia, it emerges that they regard us as opponents.'
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at NATO's summit in Wales will ensure that we will have a more visible NATO presence in the east as long as it is necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow some sich on new gas talks

Finally, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger brokered him between the two parties.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also stop the gas supply for Europe.
Europe is about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks of Power: Tolls will be "very clear"
Now, the Chancellor is making a clear commitment to this.
A licence for all the complicated details, however, is not.
Serious doubts from the CDU in relation to car tolls have surreputed the CSU.
Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke in favour of the introduction of a car toll based on lasting opposition from its CDU.
"To make it quite clear: It is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party leader said on Monday of meetings of the CDU top-level bodies in Berlin.
For a detailed model, however, Merkel did not see fit for the time being.
In the black-red government program called "certain parameters."
German Minister for Transport, Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), has made a proposal and is now working on it.
However, the NRW Christian Democrats insist on its "no" to a toll on all roads.
Merkel pointed out that finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also contributed constructively to the discussion of a bill.
Beyond the issue he also talked about more possibilities with Dobrindt to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, such as broadband.
"There is nothing special about it." Schäuble had not commented on a "mirror" report on Sunday, his house tested a concept to reward motorway investors with tolls - after the choice of 2017.
CSU CEO Horst Seehofer warned that it would be possible to develop toll concepts against the relevant minister in the Cabinet.
CDU-dog vize Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never ceased to be painted on all the streets and streets," said North Rhine-Westphalian CDU.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to discuss the matter again.
Resistance to the plans comes from the German Association of Baden-Wuerttemberg Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
In the background, there are fears that a toll will affect small border traffic with neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had asked for toll criticism from ranks of the CDU coalition forces.
The left is failing in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-toll is dead," says Party Director Bernd Riexinger of "New Würzburg Newspaper" (Monday).
"With the toll, the minister," Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette duty on all German roads that should be launched in 2016.
However, car owners must not be subject to additional burdens on the basis of the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should be given full compensation for the toll on the vehicle tax.
However, the model must not penalise foreign drivers because of their nationality, according to EU law.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed?
A British saying she thought about it as a result of misdiagnosis for many years that it would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost their entire youth in the belief that they have only lived for a few years after being diagnosed with another illness.
It was actually suffering from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK informed that misdiagnosis is a common problem for people with CMT because it is known so little about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe operation, and curved toes.
The disease is incurable and progressive, meaning that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, they believed that they have a disease with a very poor chance of survival.
Rodgers thought they would sit in a wheelchair before they were 18, and die before their 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who today is 51 years old, said: 'as a child, I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I fell constantly and everything took me longer.
I could never go to the other children rollshoe or skateboard and was often in my way to go and walk through my kind.
Rodgers said that, in the age of 13 years, after several operations to discharge their Achilles" s and their feet, they saw their sickness when their doctor had left the room and read that they had been suffering from IAs.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I did not tell anyone but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society, "she said.
When I was given a reply, I was shocked and shocked.
I thought that I would be with 18 in a wheelchair and to die from 25, and in between slow all my abilities would lose.
I made it all with me and plan my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, she realized that her abilities did not diminish as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He simply stood on, and embraced me and said, "my love, I do not think you have that, otherwise you are already in a wheelchair."
I believe you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, their CMT was detected.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I would be a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Aware month to draw attention to this disease.
We have been working on this site for the first time since the end of the former troop order as a fireman.
For nearly ten years now, the former troop arrangement in Münsingen has no longer been shot.
Despite this, it is still appearing at the heart of the Swabian alb of Swabian territory in the middle of the Swabian region.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be sprayed locally.
A deafening bang in the explosions at the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was made in Münsingen, which was closed to the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since this time the 6500 hectare site is the centrepiece of the Swabian territory of Swabian Alb, which is open to 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists.
Taxing business people in the space of Washington is rising with economic recovery
Economic recovery means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax evasion for businesses in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, such as a newly published study in the past week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia paid a combined $6 billion to government and local authorities in 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to $26.6 billion in 2012.
The government's government and corporate tax position increased by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9% a year earlier, and it was the third growth year following several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes went more closely than local taxes, to 4.3%, according to the study carried out by the Employment Agency Ernst & Young with the Center of State Tax, a tax politician.
More than half of the total tax revenues from the district, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of companies come from businesses.
Virginia, with 28%, is the lowest tax revenue from companies.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is based on a recovery of corporate real estate, say the researchers, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year, after the three consecutive years, with growth rates of less than 1%.
While much of these profits came from large countries such as California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to be reaching Washington as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia spent $10 billion on state and local real estate tax last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenue, as real-estate taxes are almost more than a fifth of corporate tax revenues.
Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, the following question is: Much of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C, is either owned by the government or of non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
It is therefore necessary to be forced to leave much more on income taxes, for example, in order to offer the same services that the other states offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenue by businesses cannot be expected to recover the real estate market alone.
Company revenues also seem to be able to recover, so the data.
Companies in the region reported income tax for state organisations from $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
With $1 billion in corporate income, $1 billion in corporate income was the highest in the region.
While the trend is going in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses does not grow evenly in all three places.
The current rate in the district was 4.3 percent of the average national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, compared to 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6% in all three offices, has the least income tax (in all three, there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company's tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district with a relatively high rate of 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that fewer state and local corporate taxes were required in Virginia and a better fiscal climate than in Maryland is required.
In the study, the district was not investigated.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.9% to 6% this year, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5% this year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's income tax rate down to 3% by 2017.
In the meantime, the small businesses seem to be doing better in the area of Washington, and they therefore pay more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes that are paid for personal income by small businessmen - a transitional structure that is organized by most small businesses - in District, Maryland, and Virginia last year increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes throughout the country will presumably continue this year, with an increase in the overall tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 in comparison to the same period of the previous year.
Still, the space of Washington may lag behind when the federal government's spending cuts affect the employment market in the region.
Traveler City: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and Malz - also a popular combination in China.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's Partner City in China now wants a brewery and also hopes to see a direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's sister city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent desire of officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the Vice-Secretary of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD-delegation in his city.
Time and again, the official Communist Party's ruling Communist Party returned to this cause of the 12-million-million metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also called the canton in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, warb Li.
That is why people also want to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessical SPD-Chairman Thorsten Schäfer Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he will be looking for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it does not need much: Good water, grain and vitality," he added to the party upper in Guangzhou.
This joy of life has already been blown away by Mr Li, who flattered the host to the host.
As a result, the functional presence of Guangzhou with Shepherd Gümbel collapsed - but with red wine that was served to the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingló goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao-beer is brewed according to the German purity order.
More Commerce
A second wish by the Chinese hosts would be an airline direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice leader Li.
Lufthansa had offered a flight earlier but, for economic reasons, was cancelled in 2012.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business transactions between our two cities are growing ever further."
At the moment, travellers would have to take the detour via Changsha in the province of Hunan.
The administration of Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, hopes to see the flying flight.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats in the foreground.
"It is a very good idea," answered Schäfer Gümbel - the Chinese Deputy Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany.
Sustainable partnership
The Deputy Vice leader of Guangzhou hopes that next year he will be able to visit Frankfurt.
Mr Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this role.
He came to office only this year after his predecessor was taken out of office because of accusations of corruption.
Also the leader of the party Wan Qinglian had to go.
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration that is enforced by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in China's Communist Party.
Prior to his inauguration in Guangzhou, he worked as a leader in Fujian, where the VW VW company set up a large plant.
Frankfurt officially entered into more than a dozen town-twinning partnerships.
The long distance linking to the foreclosure is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example, with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year anniversary of the German-Chinese Connection was celebrated.
The South China metropolis of the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse.
Next year, they wanted to reach a total GDP of EUR 250 billion, and Li.
The family of Joan Rivers "expresses the thumb"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she came into a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter today demonstrated hope that the 81-year-old comedian recovered from her illness.
"Thanks for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a communication today.
We press all the thumbs down.
After an emergency, her mother was given an emergency in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy in a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, to the Mount Sinai hospital.
The doctors keep them in line with them and carefully monitor them, until they are more satisfied with their state of affairs, which is still described as "serious."
The reactions came from many pages, including in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Green vacuum cleaner and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that come into trade as of today, there will be stricter environmental standards in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will be able to see a label from 1 September on a label on which the buyer can see at a glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars in the pollutant category "Euro 6" are more stringent nitrous oxides.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolds: They will receive a uniform minimum wage for a federal minimum of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys the switch for $1,04 billion.
Amazon confirmed just what information was reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video production, and a huge number of other things - purchases the Videostreaming service system for $1,04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected to transfer Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago it looked as if the sale of trucking to Google's video service for a cool billion was decided, and the cooperation appeared to be natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago than Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravourpieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The Twitter interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which better know the (mostly older) games a painting of intelligence theatre, is already very popular on YouTube.
It is exactly the case that YouTube is often called when you want to describe it, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy YouTube has been captured, a textbook example of an established technology that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery to why the deal with YouTube has not been reached, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything we know at the moment is this statement from Emmet shear, President of Twitch: "We have chosen Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us to get there more quickly."
To be honest, it is another mystery, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like myself, who say they prefer to play sports than to watch it, it's hard to see the attraction they expect to watch others play in the game, instead of taking control of the control panel.
It is one thing to watch a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning, while being in Resident Evil is easy, and something very different, to watch a spider at the end of the race, as he will be shot in the head in Call of Duty at 3 o'clock in the morning.
All these games you could see right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are equestrian games, so it can be a good recipe for headaches without your own control over the viewing perspective.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger banners of our electronic age are all games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtuoso, his Twitter channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do sceptics know as I do?
Twitch is called and is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic points.
And how exactly will Amazon make money from it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated in Amazon Instant Video, how YouTube Twitch could easily swallow.
But it's something that every company likes to do: Thousands of young men, who are recruited as advertisers.
As the head of Twitch, shear, said, Amazon and Twitch, believe both in the future of the gaming, "and the medium does not show signs of contraction, not even - yes - as a spectator sport.
At the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest there was a lot on the Saturday evening.
The concept of the organizers voted.
In spite of the strong rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans arrived at the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the entry had to be stopped.
"It was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and Fun.
In two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness on the day and at night with various shows.
Oh, and the fun comes out of it anyway.
This was evident at the early Saturday, when the first visitors went to the Open Air.
A feast for all generations had promised the organizers.
And they have managed to do so.
Around the supply stands on the Burggarten meadow, there were a lot of Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and other surrounding areas.
They performed the first live performances, teamed with the foot in the rhythm, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: Pure relaxation and enjoyment were required.
And that for generations.
On top of that, the white sand on the beach bar on the beach bar, which was placed on the ceiling on the extra floored white sand at the beach bar, located on a wine cellar in the Vinothek, called the young at the Hüpfburg, which was a big attraction for the smaller guests.
But also in the case of children's children, the volunteers were in the truest sense of the word to do their utmost to be able to get in touch with imaginative creations in the small faces.
The bigger players took advantage of the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop, which was commissioned by the Goodfoot crew of Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 pm prasselte to the visitors, especially families sought the vastness and drying.
However, this did not detract from the attractiveness of the festival.
"There came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success across the line."
That is why I am not going to repeat the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked out, Sem made it clear in a first record on Sunday to the popular vote.
He said that, in the meantime, it had to be stopped.
The safety firm was obviously booked with too little effort.
The result: Some who already paid did not enter the site anymore.
The feedback was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer of about 1200 visitors who worked in the Burggarten.
There were problems when it comes to clay.
As a result, Rox was the world's first ever to be a member of the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode of the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned Swabes could not be built up, because the tents could not be brought to salt for a tyre break.
However, "next year they will be here," according to the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open Airs has been more than successful from the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have committed a number of mistakes that will still be lost for the first time, but must be removed from the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organizers have to criticize critique.
"Unfortunately, but for 12 euros one was simply expecting more," Melanie Meier expressed on the event page.
"You have unfortunately taken you a bit," said Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others do not look very closely at the initial problems.
I think it is very good that some are not only stupid, but also really trying to put something on its feet.
Hat off!," writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now the organizers have a year to stop these points of criticism.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's emblem shrink
It is not as expected.
On the contrary, the package is waiting for it to be used in the distinctive structure.
The action is in the context of a bigger measure: Nearly 50 years after the construction of the space tracking station Tira, the shell, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new wheel will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47,5 meters than the old one.
However, the size still remains the world record.
The last step to complete the new shell is the Kappentausch.
The upper quarters of the old shell is separated and replaced with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new shell is set up.
If the weather is good, the action will be taken at the beginning of this week.
Participating in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge is treacherous.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom shouted so much when their frozen water was cast over the head that they hurt the bone structure of their face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge was painful at the same time.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she had so much trouble with the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she turned the jaws off.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain stirred so much when their frozen water was cast over the head that they injured their face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did indeed, my jaws were easy, "she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that did not happen, the jaw was wrong, and then I realized that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister also saw that, and they made themselves laugh almost in the pants, but I had to enter the emergency.
The 20-year-old from the British have been admitted to the hospital to let the jaws return to the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet feeling and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the congregations be joining in the same way?
Finally, there has always been a clash between the two Wolfratshauser Burgundy.
Think ahead of possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Fortress, the late Richard Dimbath, former Chairman of the Wolfraternal Burgfreunde, held the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was not a good climate between the Burgverein and the castles Wolfratshausen.
From now on, the positions on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and possible reconstruction have been different.
Two camps are now moving on: It is likely that talks will soon be held on a common approach.
This is confirmed by the leaders of Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called to Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down," reports Sjöberg.
In his view all members of the two clubs in the future would be able to pull together again.
That is how things have been achieved more quickly.
While the burgers around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had been in the eye for the most recent rebuilding of the castle on the mountain forest, stands at the forefront of the Burgverein um Sjöberg in the foreground.
Herbert Piffl, Chairman of the Burgfreunde, has received his/her own data on the call.
Since her death, he has been living in love for the castle lovers.
A new chairman shall be found in a general meeting in the middle of September.
Currently the club members are members of the Association, according to the 74-year old age.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we left the club's activities out of respect first." This "reflection phase" would have been necessary to think about how to proceed."
According to Piffl the new chair is said to enter into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle's fans could also have a current mood picture within their group.
There is no candidate for the presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find him," he himself does not want to run because he has his place of residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratambler.
The Tölzer wanted to work on the project but would like to continue."
The different points of reconstruction will continue in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He appreciated Dimbath as "missionary," who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Because of the high level of participation of the population, as well as through volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I too was skeptical at the beginning.
Over time, however, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push forward the project," it might be possible to create a "one-of-a-kind position" for the planet.
There is nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be eligible for EU grants, visitors' passes and potential sponsors, believe Piffl believes in Piffl.
"I personally hope that the idea of reconstruction cannot be dismissed on board." He hope that the Burgverein may be moved on this point.
Its goal is to document history first, "is important and good."
Then you could look at it.
Clever Way to Save Unider Books
Since the cost of full-time textbooks is more than $1,000 per year for many students, the Fast-second candidate, Matt Schroeder, turned a clever saving idea.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to postpone restitution.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I received it for $10 for a semester and a Chick--A-Kek," said Schroeder, 19, who visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The book would have cost him $430 for the last semester, he said.
He gave $120.
The Rotary Foundation divided the student on an average of more than $1,200 per year for textbooks and study material, but there would be a number of cost-cutting options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are becoming increasingly a solution for the students.
The renting of textbooks is more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 university bookshops, said that the listing of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that around a quarter of books was rented out in the College-bookstores in the last Spring Festival, Mr Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all textbooks are bought by the National Association of College Stores in Campus-bookshops.
Here is the single one for the best deals.
Online purchase
Some new books cost online only a third of the price for which they have to be in the campsite book store.
The ninth issue of "memoranda" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased for 239.99 $as a specialist book dealer Chegg.com.
Used to buy
If the notes from other or normal user trails do not represent anything, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49 $.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduation student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent on Amazon.com 42 Cents spent for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Comprehension The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book has been sold for 48 $.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors to question whether previous expenditure is admissible.
Sometimes the updates for the training sessions are not relevant.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the costs for the most recent issue.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
The rental of textbooks is worth a reflection if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return it and you do not want to keep the books after the end of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent a seminary for about $20 for a period of one semester.
Inform yourself about the rules of the transaction you are renting, including about the penalty fees that may apply to writing notes, attachments or usage tracks.
Renters: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-Books, instead of traditional textbooks, are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of major retailers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature often find the best offers, since many classics can be downloaded today for free, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is going to visit the Pepperdine Law School in the near future, recommends the ISBOL for the pricing of books, as it is possible to be sure of finding the right textbook.
And before an online order should be checked, according to Gault, whether the book is in fact in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery period, and finally paid the full price in the College-book store.
Why 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was not a cash register?
"The Expendables 3" of Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million in US $90 million in US dollars, while "Sin City: A Lady to Kill For" only played $12 million in his budget of $70 million.
The movie "Sex Tape" directed at Cameron Diaz played a mere $14.6 million during the opening weekend, while children's films like "Dragon Studs easily made 2" also disappoint the income.
An article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that in childhood films the lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves.
Collin named 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's movies, and described "Dragon Rangmen easily made 2" as a pure "functional "fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to movies for a somewhat older target group it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July entertainment Weekly published the average cinematographic and metacritic-assessment for every summer film that was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 screens.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and point out that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Romney's upcoming Junnery movie, said to the Hollywood reporter: "I believe that times are changing."
We must accept that and not try to emulate the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated sales of $1.2 billion in streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to 837 million dollars.
In the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on films of comics and prophesied a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy might well contain a real core.
Other representatives of the film industry, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions, and Jurassic World, are expected to be able to be expected in the summer of 2015.
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results recently as simply "cyclically" and said to Hollywood reporters: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema fare, and no one will worry more about business."
A step in the right direction has been taken several years ago, when the second round of table tennis was cancelled for tightening up the division of the population.
Now the German table tennis club has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
As a result, who has not risen, has gone up.
For example, the Sun's class-largest team Torpedo in the region of Upper Jerusalem has avoided the descent but plays only five stars in the coming season.
Four of them remain Torpedos in the regional league, despite their grandiose coverage.
The boys and girls of Torpedo will start in the Low Sector League, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lengern and the Torpedo Reserves are located in the new associations' league, in the National League there is no more representative clubs.
The TV violinist at the League League is played by the TTV Geismar, the Torpedo-Second in the National League.
What matters from the composition looks like a better district class, is now the new district top league south.
Here are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the district league play as a regional representative of Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The main league of women begins at least in case strength.
Cronies, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with you.
In the County League, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are running.
With nine teams each.
The SC Weend sends its girls to the small group league.
Torpedo II is also not complete, so it is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two goddesses start with nine teams.
In the west season the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengern II.
In the east-season it is played by Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Three League League consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in Easter, where there are no more men in the district level.
It is striking that no of the six second group classes can be achieved, here the innovative and transformational conductor will have to worry about.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered for an anti-sodium march.
On Sunday there were about 150 people in Cardiff in front of the city hall there to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough has watched the events during the weekend and talked with demonstrators who have traveled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teens out of the Blue Mountains outflying
Two young people in youth have been brought into safety with the rope winch after they were trapped in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old husband just broke up in Blackheath on their tour at Govett Leap in Blackheath.
Worried relatives called for the police at about 8 p.m. when the two were not back home.
A search engine from local police and rescue services broke down and the pair was found around 23 o'clock near the Bridal Veil Waterfalls.
The girl fell on his knees and the man was overthrown and had his head beaten.
Rescue forces stayed overnight at the couple, and they were flown on Monday morning.
They were supplied in a stable state with a ambulance in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Hostile Pakistan's Protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators were called by soldiers from the PTV building, said information minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter once again resumed the broadcast over half an hour ago.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged equipment in the editorial board.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the Heads of Government, accusing them of electoral fraud.
The police divided up with around one kilometer away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on Monday, on Monday, there had been clashes of some 3,000 demonstrators with security services.
After hospital information, a policeman was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured, as demonstrators tried to invade Sharifs's residence.
They demand the resignation of the prime minister.
On Sunday evening, on Sunday evening, the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time, and without using force."
The message was said in the communication: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence has caused concern about intervention by the military, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests taken by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Preacher Tahirul Qaddafi took place since Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to withdraw from the contract.
Khan and Qaddafi had called on their followers on Sunday to do away with them.
"We will not decline, without Sharif to resign," said Khan.
He spoke in a similar way.
Khan accuses Sharif to have the parliamentary elections in May of last year through fraud.
He is calling for the withdrawal of the central and provincial governments.
The intention is to reform a transitional government in order to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in place to protect the government district.
The demonstrators were sitting peacefully in front of Parliament until Khan and Qaddafi appealed to him in the weekend to invade Sharifs's residence.
Hütteldorfer on position three of the table after two season wins.
Mit dem 2: 0 über Grödig hat for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday a conciliatory end.
"The victory is very liberating," he said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate end in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The experience was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and Torutz e Steffen Hofmann, who met three in front of Green, White.
Jumping on Siegerstraße Rapid with the second round of the race led to the correct response to the disappointment at Helsinki and goes with a chance of success in the country games.
"We wanted to see a positive reaction," said External Representative Thomas Schrammel, who won the course on victory with his magnificent leader Volley in the 14th minute.
"I thought I was looking for all the frustrations of Thursday, and I stumbled into the bar," the 26 year-old smiled smiling.
So far, as Schrammel had met on 13 November, 2010, this was still for Ried.
The first championship in the Rapid-Dress will therefore be remembered as a special reminder.
"For me this is something very special, I am from the rapid-media," said Schrammel.
Thanks to Mario Pavelic's short tank house from Mario Pavelic, he moved from the left to the Right Defensivpage and made his cause very good there.
He has enough experience to be able to use this position as a mirror.
The Tor has earned him, he has done some assists this year," he praised Barisic.
Team showed character shrammel provided also the flanks to 2: 0 by Hofmann in an hour that finally led to the decision.
In this case, the guests would have been able to write to them.
"Thank God we have been lucky today," he also noticed Shrammel, who pointed this out to the divergence of performance and result in recent weeks, "the results did not vote, but the game was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games it was better than it was today" - against "the strongest team that played this season in this stadium."
The first three-point tripod since 26 July proved that the team structure remained intact, despite the fact that today, my team has shown that they have a character.
For him, it is no less pleasing: 'that we have finally played back to zero'.
Many of the work done while playing for a while, the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have broken several breakdowns, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl, and Philipp Schobesberger made their start cards, make the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," Mr Barisic, who, in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic player, lost "which was very stable lately."
The country of pause must therefore be used to leld "wounds to fill in and in the body of the body a bit," explained Barisic, who has in his ranks the five U21 Wahids in his rows.
One that seems to be particularly suitable for the break is Captain Hofmann.
He fights for the crew, goes beyond pain.
It is at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us," noted Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game rapids prior to their confusion in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also achieved the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who earned his 350, he was the first hit from the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 on the Ataturk).
Hofmann: "Cannot believe that everything is fine now" we certainly have a bit of luck, but at some point, luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
He called, however, to concentrate on working: 'You cannot see this not always in black and white.
We have not played so badly in recent weeks, as has been pointed out.
We must not, however, believe that everything is right now.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can really help at the moment.
They keep to me at certain stages," said Hofmann.
Max coach Michael Baur had little to accuse him and his team.
He regretted the quick countercontract from the magic gate, as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute, which was wrongly read out by arbitrators.
The only criticism that I can make to the team is that we have not been sufficiently precise in a number of stages.
We have had too few degrees in this regard.
Interior defense of Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "She did not start at the same time, but then we have found and even set a Tor.
Broadly speaking, there would have been more in it.

A powerful tribe showed us in our riddle of the summer series "My part of the Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these trees exist in the district, the extracted copy is the "Scourge � e" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A shallow footpath leads up to the 600 years old oak tree.
It is about coppeln, basalt craters and basalt stones.
A bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
A natural monument, it towers over the other trees in the surrounding area and is reminiscent of an age of more than eight metres on an American giant tree.
A little Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intensive research, however, there were simply references to the name issue.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bishop's Hospital archive and consulted older people from Unterweißenbrunn in order to find out what relief it has with the scourges.
The result of his investigations remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
So, some 80 years ago, the goat's herdsmen had driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn on the most arduous and paved fields.
At the foot of the tree, the farms must have been stretched out of the rise.
In the meantime, the area has gained its significance, because in the meadows, there are still goat herds.
The area has also been declared to be the core zone of the biosphere reserve approved by Schneider.
When you enter the stone collections, you should be careful, as the basalt warmed from the sun is also a popular pastime for Crusaders.
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but it is hidden.
Further directions are signposted, going up towards Hochrhön and invite you to an extensive hike.
Where is the water castle?
A water castle that is being sought in our next task, however, is very rare to find.
There is already a good impression of the gap in the ditch in the district, but we have some historic buildings in the district, to which the building courtyard could fit.
Where is our "piece of the Rhöner Glück"?
My Lesson of Rhöner Glück
As with previous series of the Main-Post in recent years, there will be prizes again this year when they have the right solution.
If you like to photograph, you can also join.
At the e-mail address red.neustadt @ mainpost.de you can send us the solution and also your personal "piece of the Rhöner Glück" under this keyword.
The most beautiful photos will be published.
After weeks ago, Italy's prime minister, Matteo Renzi, pushed through strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit last week to nominate his foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, as head of the EU's foreign policy, and he is the successor of Britin Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, acting as the local newspaper La Repubblica, considers the vocation of the Mogherini, the favorite in the government team, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He is also expecting a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to calm down, as Mogherini is assigned to him again and again, as Mogherini is assigned to it, albeit in a moderate way.
Against the conservative representatives with President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the European Parliament, Mr Tusk, he would be the dominant opinion in Rome to bring about a political balance.
The President of the Commission, Mr Juncker, is the Deputy President of the EU at the same time.
The EU Parliament's still pending agreement is regarded as safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would not have called the nomination of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) the nomination of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) hardly any 'important recognition' of Italy's role in the EU.
For almost two decades, la Repubblica has been optimistic that the "enormous challenges" have been shown to the "enormous challenges" which have been known for almost two decades in leading party offices.
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her political career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined in 2008 with the Catholic Center Party.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Socialists).
With the election in 2001 in the Party Council of the left-wing Democrats, they joined the high party politics, worked in the foreign policy section, whose leader it soon became.
They have occupied traditional Italian foreign policy priorities such as the Middle East, which has been known by studies on the NATO operation in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved in a troop contingent, and has been involved in contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she is a member of the Chamber of Deputies in which she is an expert for defence and European and international affairs.
As Renzi was Prime Minister in February 2014, he headed Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If, today, the PD has maintained a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to over 40% of the party's vote in the EU elections in May, then, as in PD-circles, Federica Mogherini played a part in that.
There is no diplomatic experience in Brussels, the new EU representatives have too little diplomatic experience, so that it lacks substance, is learned in the PD.
In Brussels, especially from Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's misconceptions are being persecuted for the crisis in Ukraine, and they are diffused as a "country friendly course."
It supports the Nord Stream pipeline, operated by the Russian company Gazprom, on which Russian gas will be transported directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to protect Italy's energy security.
After his tenure as President of the European Union in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow in July for her first state visit to Moscow.
Photos taken with Putin at shake-hands have been denounced in Brussels with indignation, as well as inviting the Kremlin leaders into a Milan Economic Summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.

The socialists in France should keep their mouth and put France in order," the most important ally of François Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided Left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president whose cabinet was hit by a large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said in great applause.
As an appeasing gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite strong calls for a relaxation of the arrangement of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs, in France.
On Saturday, Hollande strongly urged his co-socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister for Justice, has striven to the gearbox, in which she appeared at a meeting of renegade socialist members, and criticized the Socialist Party for accepting the French "faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, pottly failed to convince the Socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new United States government would keep up for more than a few months.
François Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also have no, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not survived a summer.
"And the new will not survive the fall or winter," said milling the Le Pen against supporters.
She repeated the reputations of her party after a resolution of this House and said she was confident that he would emerge as the winner in early elections and be ready to run the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat at the local elections in March and the right-wing national front in the EU elections in May.
A poll in Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to several rival groups before the end of Hollande's term of 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would be quick to lose patience if the new socialist government did not make an improvement in the economy and the rate of return.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but the public opinion must feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the third world leader in the world, has advanced negotiations for the acquisition of the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and to its wealthier customers, while competing with major rivals like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement might be announced this week, said the sources on Sunday and warned that the talks might also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, since the negotiations are not in public.
Representative of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise liners on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, located in Miami, operates among the brand names Oceania and Regent, which, together with eight cruise ships, operate on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 from $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise liners industry is about $29 billion a year, and in the next few years, it is expected to be in emerging economies such as China and India, due to the expansion of the middle class.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises requested the exchange on the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal 2007.
In its current form, Lima Cruise, in its current form, came into being in 2000 by a merger with a cross vehicle supplier owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and Kasinomsia Group, under the supervision of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock market in January 2013.
At the end of June, according to the admission authorities, control authorities held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP a 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together, according to the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises, have more than 82 percent of passenger capacity in American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A pekingfaithful group driven the proximity of the Chinese flag.
The permanent committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday, which allows only two or three candidates for leadership in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve majority support for a Nomination Committee, which is expected to be occupied by members of the Member States.
By this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition democrats to be admitted to vote and have led pro-democracy activists to make their threat felt and paralyse Hong Kong's financial center in Hong Kong with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have been a controversial topic in Hong Kong for a long time; and China's party leader fears that calls for democracy extend to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which in June pointed out China's dominance over Hong Kong, pro-democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region, in which hundreds of thousands took place in the city's business district and organized a site there.
Lis interviewed is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Zhang Rongshun, as well as the Vice-Director of Hong Kong's Office for Foreign Affairs and Macaus of the State Council, in the course of the day, should be consulted.
Student activists announced to meet in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the leadership office in Hong Kong.
Britain did not see any democratic elements until the end of the 1950s colonial rule in Hong Kong.
Putin calls for Kiev to take "state of opinion" with the Ostukraine.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin called for Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government would stop fighting against the separatists in the country's east, and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that it would be a part of Russia under the control of the separatists area of Ostukraine, but that his status to Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent his rights and interests.
Putin's call to Kiev's government for negotiations on an equal footing with Russia's insurgents, however, fits with the strategy that he seems to be pursuing since the beginning of the riots five months ago: Help for the separatists to capture areas and put pressure on the Ukrainian Government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with the state television channel Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reclaim the separatist regions in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently been called "Novorossiya" or "Neurussland," which is reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary peak of the Russian empire.
He pointed out that all those engaged in the election campaign for the elections on 26 october, and during government groups attacking civilian communities in the areas affected by separatists in peace talks in the near future, Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start a detailed discussion, not only on technical issues, but also in the political organisation of society and the state status of the countries of South-East Ukraine in order to protect the interests of those living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by Kiev's leaders to dispel fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin's clarification on correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks highlighted Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, contrary to the direct attack on the Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the period prior to the conflict made a large majority for the country to stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy mentioned by Russian diplomats in international fora would give regional governments in Ukraine a power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control of a territory that links Russia's territory with Crimea.
The Bay of the Black Sea, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important trade port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostow region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his speech on the inauguration on 7 June, suggested that, after new elections, Ukrainian legislation should be considered as amendments to the Constitution, giving the respective regions greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arming and incitement to Moscow is accused of.
Putin's final call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders ensued after Russian troops and tanks invaded the eastern Ukraine after Russian troops and tanks entered into the eastern Ukraine after Russian troops and tanks came into force last week.
The separatists supported by Russia in the palm of man, according to fears of Ukrainian security officers, the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, control Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, there have been massive civilian and military preparations to secure Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke in Brussels on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels, asking for deeds to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just before a point on which there is no turning back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided no concrete actions, the leadership demanded a draft further sanctions against Russia, which would come into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donezsk last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Speaker of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council on Saturday in Kiev.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were part of the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parachutists who were captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko divided Lysenko on Sunday.
Nucado scandal about Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger about hackers who are believed to have stolen from his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who's Who of Hollywood from Hollywood.
The movie city is in excitement since a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal about celebrities on the Internet.
The responsible hacker has more than 60 naked photos from Lawrence, Star of "the Tribute of panem" and superstars, among them the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers in Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
From the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were allegedly publicized.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Most, who had looted last month with Grecko, said to Confidential: "It is disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, said a news website that the Hack was 'shameful' and that those concerned felt 'violated'.
The hackers probably have 30 pictures from Palmer with their former friend Scott Speedman, among them two pictures in which they are located at the top without a pool.
"Love is Unwon bar "with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker are not available for comments on the chopped images.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ: "It is an outrageous violation of privacy."
Actors Seth Rogen convicted the hacker in his tweet: "hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing other than selling Hehler goods."
From a legal point of view, it should not be possible to tolerate the spread of stolen images.
During the 8th Radler, Jogger and hikers were on the way to the Great Feldberg to support the "Help for Creole children."
The tour, which was one of a Tortur, turned to the other a light training.
However, everyone agreed on one thing: It has been fun.
Thomas Studanski is going to have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus was driven by the wheel to the Feldberg.
For the good cause.
The little mussels can easily be thrown away, especially as he has also brought him a valuable insight into his participation in the 8th cycle on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for Crebelles Children" (Frankfurt).
It is a big thing.
"I know now that I can do that - fine!"
Small pamphlet on the way in the applause?
When I should have stopped, if I had stopped, had it gone out of it?
As Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Oberurseler City Council, many of the 718 participants met yesterday in the early stages of the mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to cross over 11 kilometres long course between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
The very red Dress red bike - red dress, red bike - made something to understatement ("Any many professionals, since suits the goal!"), then it turned to the mountain for half a pro and went for 45 minutes without surpassing the goal.
He also runs through the circuit in a slip, as well as Nina Kuhn, pressesprecherin the city of Oberursel, who together with Frank Grüneisen went on the road.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "Here it is about Charity, here we are with us - an exit would have been done anyway,"" said Kuhn.
On the way, they had hit Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) was going down to Oberursel in the morning to get back to the height again.
In the morning at 9 o'clock in the saddle, the Frankfurt Florian Zierz turned to the saddle, "made" the field mountain twice and then to roll back home.
Fun was also "Fritten-Toni."
For the chef of the Oberurseler cult kiosks, it is easy to cycle through the Feldberg.
He worked for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kg racing wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to do so," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained mainzer says he is a "ambitious racer."
He must be, as he was on the road with the "fix" wheel, which is also racing bikes, but without a circuit board.
Not only did it prove to be the 20 hikers who went up to the summit via the White Wall and the Fuchsman at the summit, but also a jogging path that went up to the top of the summit.
As a doctor Professor Volker Lishke, who was equipped with his team, equipped with four-wheel bully and quad, for security, said: "The kenn "I from Frankfurt who is trained for a special sleigh ride, just that he pulls the slide itself.
The 718 participants - and thus never before - were sent to the track in groups in the morning.
The trekkers first at 9.30 a.m..
It followed the first cyclists and runners at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers came free.
If Hansen, chair of the association "Radda on the Great Feldberg," came the start comets and wish the participants a beautiful trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the course towards Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
