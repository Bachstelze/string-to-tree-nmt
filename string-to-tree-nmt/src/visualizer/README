Code for reading alignment files of string-to-tree translations (in Nematus-format)
and displaying them in a nice web interface in comparison to string-to-string translations.

To use, first update the following paths in reader.py:

data = list(read(...

and:

data_bpe = list(read(...

to point to the alignment files.

then run:

python reader.py

change this line in s2t/index.html:

<script src="data_raw.js"></script>

to point to your new data file.

finally browse to s2t/index.html

note that in some cases the data is too large to be loaded to the browser.
in this case modify the limit in reader.py, i.e.:

max_amount = 1000

d3Tree.minimal.js holds all the logic for the actual d3 visualization in case visual modifications are needed.
