Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after rapid motorhunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver had driven it in a 70 km @/@ h zone and the bush country to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried this morning to stop a blue motorcycle after they watched it as it left a petrol station on the Bathdate Road with 125 km @/@ h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stops and continued on the Burgess Road before he crashed into the bushland where officials lost it.
The motorcycle and a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were seen later in a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accuse a 20-year-old man of failing to respect a stop and reckless driving.
He is expected to appear before the court of Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.

Reverting to the very American ideal of work rights as human rights
The congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have submitted a legislative proposal to establish trade unions as citizen rights.
"As trade unions die, middle-class jobs die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and Deputy Chairman of Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud of the civil rights law of John Lewis and the civil rights law of John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law provides workers with the same legal possibilities of discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions like other forms of discrimination.
The addition of the national employment law to create an opportunity for discrimination against workers for the organisation of a union in order to bring justice to a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or penalty - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative, at least not to American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries throughout the country, Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and comply with labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when that country called democracy, freedom of speech, press freedom and freedom of association in the same breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarised autocracy of Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions have a role to play in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "the rights of workers on unification and common negotiation and action are guaranteed." 
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers should be organised and their voice should be raised in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly said: "the right to establish associations in order to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and to every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict this right or that aim to reduce them are null and void; measures that target them are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency on the International Commission on Human Rights, which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drawn up when it was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to protect their interests or to join them." 
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that human rights are human rights.
When this country taught other countries how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to establish a union should be protected and that these unions should participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies.
Given that these rights are under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to see the American ideal, which means that working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.
How Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers" movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for the industry, raising the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History reminds us, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of working rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of worker representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that America made in the past with the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporarily that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force them to close
On Sunday, on Sunday, a US regulator stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, where lawyers said that it would probably have led to the closure of all of the state's five abortion clinics.
This measure that was imposed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June on the law, to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who carry out abortions would force them to acquire patient care in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that doctors will continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being, while seeking such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue working in law while they seek to obtain these rights," Federal judge John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing is set for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision that the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors take so much time, to obtain hospital transfer rights.
"The decision today means that women in Louisiana will avoid a vicious law that they want to respect for their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President, and Chairman of the Centre for Reproduction Rights who took possession of the law in the name of three of the five clinics of the State to stop the law.
It was not immediately obvious that the judgment was also extended to doctors from the two clinics, who did not associate themselves with the complaint and had also applied for the rights of expulsion.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a Texas law that most of the clinics remaining in the state would have forced to close have been stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that doctors are demanding unnecessary restrictions.
Anti-opposition opponents are opposed to the fact that measures serve to protect the health of women, although some also welcome the impact of a closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has the right of reproductive rights in the centre for reproductive rights.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced not to carry out abortions, the group would no longer carry out the operation because of fear of their security.
In arguing against the judgment, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, while their applications for patient marriage would remain pending.
Delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best ways of treatment lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and his brother James have posted a video album for their mother that died in 2007 with ovarian cancer.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 expatriates, who found only 25% of five years of diagnosis after diagnosis.
The research director Susan Jordan of QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions in the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDIE: New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian cancer.
Researchers studied medical care for women over seven years of age.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, existing pretreatment and social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and peripheral regions in the state, the risk of mortality in the trial was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women outside the city died with a higher probability of cancer in the city, Dr. Jordan suspects a belated diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists and they are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement in telemedicine services to counter the distances, it proposed a strengthening of the service of frozen doctors with a view to giving specialists the opportunity to provide women with more of their places of residence and to provide treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, gave rise to a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and highlighted the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto to Conquer Cancer is today published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years, learned of the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regretting declining household ownership
The decline, along with increased Sinks in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could result in gardens losing tens of thousands of pounds a year when today's young consumers, following a study of HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "core age group for garden products." 
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people spend with home for their garden.
The rise of people who live in highly urbanised areas without gardens, popular procedures, grounds for parking and the fall in garden size are other factors that are threatening the industry in which £5 billion in sales are estimated.
In the wider area of London where, over a period of 6 years, the share of homeowners from 61% to 43% has fallen, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household will be reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can not draw plants
Guy Barter, head chef for the RHS, said: "Container growers are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when they are moving." 
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail from the late 1980'' s until the middle of the 1990s.
He also predicted a better market situation for this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clerical Tahirul Qaddafi in Pakistan continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators have teamed up PTV.
Information minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed protesters back from PTV building.
The station launched its operation for about 40 minutes, but it is now sending back.
At the same time, around 3000 protesters tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometre away from it, they were equipped with sticks and stones equipped clashes with security forces.
The police put tearah in order.
The demonstrators demanded the resignation of shame, but that is rejected.
Meanwhile, the country's army is calling for a political resolution of the conflict without wasting time and using force without force." 
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday night, the military stated: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state." 
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and it has already been used more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accused Premier Sharif of being deceived by parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests were escalating at the weekend after Khan and Qaddafi called on their followers to invade Sharifs residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for the report of espionage
The Turkish State Department has appointed the senior US diplomat of the country to receive a report on US and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the director of the US Embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and The Intercept Online Magazine reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major activity for US and British intelligence agencies.
According to European news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has lost the importance of the report and has said that all major countries have been spied on each other.
A previous report that the main security service of Germany in Ankara also targeted gave rise to much angry reactions from the Turkish Government.
Warnings: Local leaders are threatened with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning of the local guides on Monday evening could also affect the movement of persons in NRW.
The area that was announced for 18 to 21 was maintained throughout Germany throughout Germany, including long-distance, regional and rail transport.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the movement of goods.

Said the district chair of the trade union of German Driving Guide -LRB- GDL -RRB-, Sven Schort, in Düsseldorf.
We expect a great deal.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the movement of goods.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do all it can to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where they were trying to strike, so that it was difficult to anticipate the consequences.
Indicting Magaluf of Coraluf
On Friday, the prosecutors presented to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca evidence of blackmail by police and employees of Calvià.
The head of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested after corruption allegations of businessmen and barmen in the notorious Binge-drinkable hotspot Magaluf.
José Antonio Navarro's chief commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs lie in custody.
According to the online newspaper of Mallorca Diario, the prosecutor presented the office of prosecutor for fighting corruption on Friday by police and employees of Calvià.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the corruption allegations and will be interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
National Spanish daily ABC reported that angry night club owners said that government cronyism has a severe impact on their business.
"It is no longer a matter of making money, it is about survival," one of the business people said to the court.
Let our livelihoods come from the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer, Magaluf made international headlines in this summer due to a viral YouTube-videos, in which an 18-year-old British tourist who performed on 24 men during a tour Fellatio was completed.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the illegal behaviour of non-alcoholic tourists in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-free tavern.
The Playhouse Club, where Fellati took place, was forced to close a year of closure, while Playhouse and the tavern Carnage will jointly pay a penalty of €55,000 -LRB- $73.000 -RRB-.
The tourist village of Magaluf, which is popular with young British tourists, is also known for a number of accidents under the pressure of alcohol, among them the trend of "Balconing," in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet weather and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport.
The spring brought a winter surprise to the south, with strong winds and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide airport.
On the evening of 21, a further 5mm rain on the town fell, after 6,6mm, which had already gone down on Sunday on Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of very short storms, including a crowd that began shortly before 20 and which lasted for almost 4mm in around 10 minutes.
On Monday, after the winter of spring, the temperatures in the city fell to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C on Monday.
The bad weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft was supposed to land shortly after 7.30 p.m. but has been hit by a blow - a sudden change in the wind speed or direction of a short distance.
At that time, wind reached around 50 km @/@ h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to go through on a second landing flight and that it was eventually set up around 20.40.
The flight delay led to delays in some of the other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 degrees is predicted on Tuesday, with possible shows.
Matthew believes that high time is the great time to destroy them.
In the face of the technical progress that is threatening to turn our cosy home into high-tech switches, our columnist Bernd Matthies has teamed up with very familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this here, my gaze comes to the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone and I think: Boah as retro is?
But there is one thought: If the cable would not be, all the listeners would fly around in the house in the shortest possible time and that would be much more retro.
Anyway, is the ekeltronic -LRB- ekeltronic?
No, typing error: Electronic -RRB- sector the rule that is the world's novelty today of tomorrow's electric waste - out of date.
And anyone who, for example, has a tube TV in the living room simply says that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressure from Ifa at Funkturm this week, we again see our total incompetence in matters of electronics.
The Laie, who once dominated a washing machine and a CD player, now does not even understand the purpose of the equipment that will be extended before him with the obvious of expert spreader before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yes, of course?
What are we to talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such Quark?
After all, for around 20 years we have been trying to ensure that we are able to link our house.
This means that the yoghurt itself can be used to tell us that the type of fire on holiday on the Maldives tells us that it is burning in the working room.
And would it not be wonderful if we had air conditioning from the office to arrive on our arrival as soon as possible?
Yes, it does require air conditioning.
But one dream will surely come true soon: We will lift our watch watch, say it "Saugen!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner will go away.
Let us be wrong.
Everything runs on anything less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred," raunt a branch of the industry, you can connect the washing machine with a headphones, the steam garer sends the weather report and data glasses show how long the pizza does need in the oven and how long the pizza needs in the oven, but that does nothing to
We also know from everyday practice: When a modern device really is urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed.
The reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio shows.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near Gaza returned to school on Monday after they had spent the summer in air shelters, while rocket and mortar strikes on their communities fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and closed the schools of Gaza while the area was recovering from the fighting.
The school start brought a feeling of joy and expectation to southern Israel in the south of Israel, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the member of the "Pashosh" kindergarten who was hit by a missile, before meeting the student of grenades from the walls and slides.
"We are a little afraid, but they are excited," said Ronit Bart, a benevolent in Kibbutz Saad and her English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Their 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it is "a bit funny" to suddenly go back to school.
"They were difficult times and we did not go from the house at all," they said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of residents of the border communities such as Saad in their houses or their homes left their homes to move away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the missile and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education said that around a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children have been temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza that is heavily influenced by Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security." 
Israel and Hamas agreed on an open-ended ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting; however, major problems remain unresolved, such as the demand by Hamas to lift the Israel-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen the air and seaports of Gaza.
Israel is calling for a disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them were civilians, and at least 494 children were named after the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these claims and estimates that at least half of those combatants are combatants, but they do not provide any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military imposed more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area, and around 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that have been rebuilt in temporary shelter.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protected areas and the fighting continues, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon, so we can learn how children in the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl calls for NPD-prohibitive proceedings
In view of the loss of the votes of the NPD in Saxony, Thomas Strobl's CDU has declared himself in front of the German Federal Constitutional Court for an end to the current NPD-ban proceedings.
Berlin - The ongoing prohibition against NPD in front of the Federal Constitutional Court should come to an end.
"The NPD is worse than in the last time," said Strobl, who is also a CDU Lands in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the" Leipziger Volkszeitung.''
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that leads me to the result that we should combat the NPD politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
In the vote on Sunday, the NPD failed to fail in the five-percent hurdle.
A first attempt at a ban on the far-right party was 2003, because the protection of the Constitution at the time was also in the NPM lead.
In December 2013, the German Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag were not united.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now being held in tents by the newcomers.
The head office for refugees in Harburg is made up of all the seams.
Now the Internal Authority has now set up three tents of the Red Cross.
Local politicians were only briefly informed before - they are hardly enthusiastic.
"This Hauruck campaign continues to fuel citizens" reservations and gives district politicians no way to contribute constructively to the humane accommodation of refugees,'' says Britta Herrmann, Chairman of the Green Group in the Assembly of Harburg.
Their party requires that the Harburg district administration currently provides unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for filling in in the first picture are the blast of help seekers - and the fact that the authorities can not provide enough places in downstream facilities
Many refugees therefore remain longer than regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for houses in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP-data of Monday.
With this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August will be 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price increases were 10.9%, more than twice the rise in the 12 months by August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The Research Director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, stated that Sydney and Melbourne are introducing a two-tier market.
The figures from RP show that the home prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by more than five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4% over the year, is at the other end of the scale.
Mr Lawless further said that, with spring fishing, there would now be an increase in the real estate for sale for the coming months, which would give the market a real test.
"When you look at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rate, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New press, he is contrary to statements by the Managing Director Peer Medau and attests to this "like a Feldherr." 
The style of the university is not, it is said in the communication.
For example, the Medau family had been informed orally about the design of the university in the middle of June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July are definitely wrong," in that way.
At the same time, he points out that there is no "preferences" in the case of plans.
The construction of the narrow road that was required for access to the castle is less dramatic than in the case of the Meda.
It was not the speech of a nine-metre wide road that was not mentioned.
It is at present around 5.50 metres, it is a metre wider than it is so far," he says.
The argument by the Medau operators that their free and compulsory parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future does not mean they do not want to be considered.
It is not possible because this can be solved intelligently as is the case with other public parking spaces.
Thinking of local residents
The crème de Bergwichtel, which is on the grounds, should not be affected by the President of the university, in accordance with the President of higher education.
In fact, he would like to bear in mind that it is not just a matter of the child's child, but also of the residents at the arrival of the Friedrich Stenses Road and the 800 pupils of the secondary school.
It is therefore much more than that of the vested interests of the lords of Medau." 
Whether the criticism of the child's cron, with the expansion of the road, a "of the few natural corners of Coburg would be lost," may the reader himself choose." 
In the beginning of October, Pachell, along with the State Building Office of Bamberg, wants to inform the town of the importance of new development in this context.
Peer Medau informed the parents of the kindergarten last week about what the college had to say.
Therefore, the access road for the new parking deck should not take place as it does so far on the campus and the Friedrich-Stalling road, but over the Medau-Berg.
This means that the narrow road will need to be upgraded to approximately one kilometre of length.
According to the high bill of the Medaus, traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would be ten-fold.
There is talk of around 2000 vehicles every day.
In the past, the town had no intention of expressing itself on the project.
Glandorf comes from handball national team back.
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Federal States, SG Flensburg-Handewitt, primarily led to health problems for this decision.
It is not easy for me to take the decision; it has been aged over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to finish my career in the national team," World Champion announced on his Facebook page in 2007.
In this way he will take stock of 167 countries of the country and obtain 576 gates for Germany in international retirement.
Because there is still a lot of time to go, he will no longer be at the disposal of the new Federal Trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelandic man who announced on Tuesday his Kader for the country games against Switzerland, Glandorf held a long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have impressed me as much as they will inspire my longtime players and my successors.
But for my club I would also like to be healthy in the years to come, for which longer regeneration breaks are required, which does not allow the current double load to take place.
In 2012, the left wing had to fear his career.
Due to the problems of Achilles, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handballbundes -LRB- DHB -RRB- with a cortisonspritze that had later caused severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf announced a complaint against the team doctor; the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national career pass by no body.
I have some health sites that I can not ignore
After the three incidents of infection that occurred in 2012 in short intervals, I have never got the grip of my blood pressure.
To achieve this, there are some other complaints of wear.
Even at the beginning of this year I realized that I controlled my head but my body can not fool," Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine "Handball Time.''
For a comeback he would stand only in an absolute emergency.
"When all stripes tear, I am always willing to talk," said the two-fold family father of the magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can play handball.
I must also say that, after my long time in hospital in 2012, I have become rather humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I would like to go at least than I can.
In addition to the WM-Ttitle 2007 and the win of the Champions League 2014 -LRB- HSG Nordhorn -RRB- and 2010 -LRB- TBV Lemgo -RRB-, the EF-Cup took place in 2008.
In 2012 he also secured with Flensburg the European Champion winner.
German Economy in Spring by 0.2%
The crises around the world have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
From April to the end of June 2014, gross domestic product fell by 0.2% compared with the previous quarter.
This was confirmed by the Federal Statistical Office, thus confirming preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone animated the economy in the spring, while investment went back.
Foreign trade, too, has slowed down the economy.
For the first half of the year, a GDP increase of 0.8 percent compared with the second half of 2013 is due for the first half of the year.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste," which on Sunday led through the town of Burgmannsstadt.
On Sunday the town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of the Dutch "Fietzenriders." 
The largest cycling club in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste." 
It is the biggest cycle tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants were invited to sign in to Jos for organizing this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various trade journals.
We come from Den Helder and have gone overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland again in this way, and cyclists would like to know the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After signing in at the club you will find Sta.
Katharina went to a small "peace ride" through the city over the Wall where it started.
Further the route that was advertised for three different categories led in the direction of Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Mountain towards Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1,175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres of 1475 metres of altitude with 145 kilometres of metres of altitude, cyclists have proven to be their best condition.
They were dressed on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer of Jos and the mayor of Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are happy and it was a nice experience for all parties.
The organization ran without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not many people arrived, as the organizer had hoped, which was probably the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
"In 2015, we will see us again on 30 August or another weekend, but yet the cyclists will return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new run.
Constantine wake up honest memoirs
In fact, it is more philosophical witness than a biography of what Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, brought on paper on 287 pages on 287 pages.
In addition to this, he was born in Munich in Munich, Germany, where he was born on June 1, 1947.
And he is ruthless in doing so: From Onanie to the high school to shoplifting and drug use, he does not let him become a human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
It also includes abstract, but also abstract, but the more important terms include one: Love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all that he tries to go for the cause, on a very philosophical basis, but also in a very personal manner.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment, and also how he has not only shaped the music -LRB- the opera lover became a soul and a rock musician -RRB-, but also that he was born in prison.
The latter have also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the asketic monk who is born through subtraction, as he says, "by removing everything that is needed." 
Between all of these highly spiritual views there are also short anecdotes to the earth.
Here, too, he is ruthless.
Lenny Henry: My father has never taken me into the arm.
Never said "I love you" 
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was working in a factory and relationship was limited.
Henry rehearsed for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, who was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and created by the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work with some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was difficult to know it.
You never saw his face, but he only heard his voice: "Wake with the collar.
Leave your sister in peace.
Stop you!
I want to look at cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown like a child when I was a child - went with him to the pub and talked about things such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life he was this serious type in the corner that the newspaper read.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's times, he gained an insight into how life has been for him.
It is now somewhat brighter, but they are dark, they are dark, there is a deep stylized labyrinths with flame and smoke and it is much of a blow.
My father simply put himself into the tub and then he was able to hear it slowly how he started to sing because he was able to wash the foundry.
When I went around there I realized that he had done it for years to put the meal on the table and that my respect for him was greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without love of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you." 
When my mother went badly at the end of her life, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you." 
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love that he had missing as a child.
Could you stop saying "I love you" ?
Listen to me to get rid of me!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should not we be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still with French befriends with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should not we be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys's own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to their death.
So when I was very overweight and symptoms of diabetes showed, my doctor" said they need to be radical.
So I pulled out this fitness and I also had to take a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is tiring.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henrys's career in career changes may be seen in his elegant and short-cut bar.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he is captured by the theatre.
It followed the comedy of the mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience of Sitcoms and comedies who completed their busy working life.
He began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered it on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s, "I was for a fairly long time of the only black Imitator @/@ Comedian on TV." 
He learned in the profession.
I had to learn not only from the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient Witz narrative machine while I was a star on television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 in New Faces
Since his manager had the stage law of the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "black anmold," led Henry to perform his comedy there for more than five years.
My family was very uncomfortable with this.
I somehow wanted it to happen, but I do n't regret that I did it.
It was a strange and uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a" grotesque parody of black people.''
By introducing characters that celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy in the eighties.
The first series of the lenny Henry Show went on broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known among others as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series of boss.
Advertising, documentaries, TV shows and film rolls were the first in the next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008 he thought: "What do you do next, Len, because it feels like it is the time you only have time or a bit on the spot." 
Then there was a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I never learned something about him at school and mostly held him for a domain of the middle class, white in tights and a carbon head forward.
So I was very afraid of it.
All who we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it once.
Do not make it bad if you do not know what you are doing.
Take a couple of words in your mouth and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare.
Henry made 20 lines from Othellos's final speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I felt I could do it.
It was almost as if someone finally set up my head properly.
"This is what it is about, it is a serious matter, they take your text seriously, you search a bit.
The rehearsals were brutal and I read this for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident and they did not happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought you changed you." 
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt he had to talk to the public.
"A small voice said to me" You now have to bridge 10 minutes while they repair the computer." 
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea would go as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went from the stage and something in me "Oh, thank God." 
I am not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so you will stay in your role." 
Henry in Fences on Duchess Theatre
The text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good; it strengthens the tendons.
That too has come well, so it is like a big sign of the gods who tell me "This is your destiny." 
He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.
I therefore stand by it.
I really love that.
I love to be in a sample room.
Henry is still the head of a comedian - our conversation is humorous while he is imitating people again and again.
I decided not to make a booth comedy because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction is somehow dangerous to a room full of stranger.
If you are looking for it forever, you will end up with a wall.
I sometimes go live in the Apollo when I want to, but I do n't like as much as before.
I would like to ask him whether he will again make a booth.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle class and the end of a journey - I do not think I want to give up.
Is this the new incarnation here?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It is fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi blocking Road in Yemen's Capital
In the conflict between Shia Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi-pendant occupied Monday central streets in Sanaa, said a spokesman of the Huji party "Ansar Allah." 
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report about a traffic chaos in the capital.
Huthi-leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi was called upon to take action on Sunday evening, following the information of the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post." 
According to the leaf, Huthi was threatened with further escalation of the conflict, should its demands be fulfilled.
The Shia Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni Yemen, demanding the resignation of the government.
The population of the Huthi has been besieging the Yemeni capital for nearly two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the large entrance to Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there is always bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya Registered officials to Protect Lord Deaf
Kenya has thus begun to register all state officials to delete "ghost workers" from government paylists.
Staff who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a statement of government.
The government is suspected that thousands of people will receive payouts after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
In a study at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least EUR 1 million -LRB- $700,000 million -RRB- was lost every month in payments for "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suggests that salaries continue to be disbursed to accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, reporting Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials will now appear on identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data are included on biometric registrations.
Anyone who would not do so without a credible apology would go further from the paylist.
"This approach will make a significant contribution to the rationalization of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials, and the pay list on both levels of government is also eliminated -" ghost workers" are eliminated,'' Anne Waiguru said, the cabinet secretary said in the Ministry of decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal of the art adviser Helge Achenbach will be held in court on 11 November.
Five of the heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are calling for 19.4 million of Achenbach and two of his companies and two of his companies in bankruptcy proceedings.
This was shared by a judge on Monday.
Achenbach said that Achenbach betrayed the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and charged Berthold in excess of the sale price that was actually paid.
That would mean that the agreed commission was higher.
For 121 million euros, Achenbach bought items of value for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years in school, including 23 as a school director.
From this time, Manfred Richter knows many of Petershausener and Kollbach of their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but they are always based on his desire to see man in the student.
The Schneekoppe is the most well known mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves painting with the motif of his homeland.
The judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau @/@ North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
After four years of secondary school, he was already in charge of the teacher's profession.
One year later, Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour the family had to leave their house.
After a couple of months in one camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946.
This is the reason why we have judges in the Upper Franconian valley.
The formation of teachers took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometres to the nearest railway station ten kilometres per week with the train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the whole city and return to school for three kilometres.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross Home in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951, after three years of teaching, he made the second of the state examen after three years of teaching.
When Oberfranken had no free apprenticeship for him, he went to Upper Bavaria and came to school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
It was his first "serviced apartment" in the school house.
In 1958, in addition to the school, he referred to a three-room apartment in addition to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in the school association of Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the year of 1968 @/@ 69, they were grouped together in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When Indersdorf was founded, only primary school remained in place.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector, Georg Sigl, moved to Karlsruhe - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and in September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to obtain the building that was extended in 1997 to judge retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then Mayor of Ludwig Götz, who, in addition to a workshop space and the extension of 1997 cellars, was also allowed to build a workshop room and the extension of the basement of 1997, although the guidelines for school buildings failed to be eligible for support.
"Mayor Götz was very indebted," he remembered.
In his whole career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a member of the government who replied to a lecture of a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget the love of" .
"You have to give children two things: Roots and wings," says today, 84-year-old.
And he had to know that "it does not always succeed." It is not clear whether he alone means his own students or his own six children.
In each case, judge was sometimes unconventional.
When students are investigated, they did not get criminal work and have not been beaten.
At the expense of the parish, judges had created two pair of boxing gloves and had to compete against each other against each other, even if there was to be a cousin.
For the benefit of the school, judges used a good relationship with the then Mayor Ludwig Götz -LRB- CSU -RRB-.
This moved the party-less judge of his retirement in 1996, at least as a last of the CSU list for the local council.
However, the judge was elected on the square and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists set out in the spa gardens of Bad Salzhausen and Scots stopovers.
If Radler is on her tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast, it is not special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of the rest made the impression: The 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour and accompanying companion enjoyed a break in the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "cycling and celebrate newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants on Thursday met at Bad Vilbel and experienced a concert of Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday it was serious: The Radler took the first stage, 60 km above Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and continuing to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of the mayor of Madrid, who took part in Bad Vilbel by bike, welcomed the director of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of the body and mind, all manner of preparation was prepared for good things: The women from the city and the town of Nieder-Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple, kennel, stream and cheese cake that wonderfully meditate with the skilled cyclists.
"These cakes can only bake land women," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while he stopped another bit.
Cold refreshments could be found at the drop of head of the sports club scour-Nidda.
The duo Bravo has taught visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and talented applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
One gentleman also enjoyed a head massage of his partner: "He earned it and finally he has already teamed up the bicycle chains today." 
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: They were interviewed at the fountain before the tip of reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to promote the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Since the first hr4-Radtour 2004 as the tourist guide in 2004, Mrs. Tobias Hagen has also been able to do plenty of it to do the same with the technique on the ground.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his staff and sent a radio with his staff and the 15-person motorcycle staples of the police state of Hessen wrote Facebook entries and made reports they also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants are from the Rhine-Main area," he told us," even from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from many cities in Westphalia, cyclists are coming.
The number of participants depends on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I will host the participants in hotels, in category II in collection accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke down after one and a half hours: "Chüss!" 
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen," they came to leave.
After the arrival in Scots the group was allowed to pause briefly.
But in the evening the cyclists were required to go to the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing -LRB- GTS -RRB-, the Park had a nice festive atmosphere and of course it had been prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS-CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC-Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sach in his role as a member of the Executive Board of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were obviously pleased about the "many operations in Scots." 
DJ Tobias Hagen then gave the dance stage free.
The opportunity of being gay in the open air was eagerly used in spite of the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests there was an increasing number of citizens who were as enthusiastic as the great spirits of cyclists.
On the second day the stations Birstein, Guarditersbach and Bad Orb, including a concert with the Trenkers, were on the second day.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the sportsmen met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy against the government
A total of 33 policemen have been arrested in Turkey on account of the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," reporting local media agencies.
Police authorities did not make an immediate comment.
Among those who were arrested, 14 senior police officers are involved, and they are reporting on to Keuriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police were arrested because they are alleged to have set up organized crime and tap telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -LRB- who was Prime Minister at the time -RRB- described her approach as part of the activities that are being led by the Islamist clerical of the decadence of the Bush administration against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools open almost everywhere in Ukraine on Monday -LRB- September 1 -RRB- after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told journalists that not all schools had reopened but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The events of September were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We need to fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian front of the population must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school at Slawjansk, who visited Jazenjuks subsidiary, spoke of Russian.
We hope there will finally be peace here and that the children will receive a education that will be useful to them in another life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, ballons in their hands and flowers for their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She meets with a proud retirement back from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tor party.
And it has its own frontal experience.
Her career began with the global management consultancy Bain and Co., which she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the chief post of mother company Pearsons went to a young male colleague.
Their compensation is estimated to be nearly 1 million pounds.
Their political rankings are also sound.
She was recommended to David Cameron of Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: She became advisor to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory of a member of the council.
Even in May, I described the role of the Chairman with a poisoned Kelch.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
In two directions, confidence has an impact on the first guard of its own manage hierarchy in the BBC, as well as outside as a voice of public concern and disquiet when things go wrong.
This provides for an almost unsustainable Duopol, which requires a full comprehensive reform.
But whichever incoming chairman would risk playing on everything, an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may perhaps bring himself to his job, would be likely to take hold of an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty.
It is a difficult task.
And as if it were not enough, many would like to see the BBC reduced - power, money and status.
While the competition is approaching and new technologies are threatening old and comfortable collateral, there is a special risk of being negotiated on the BBC for the BBC.
For the modest sum of 145.50 million a year, the British public is buying the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: It says it reaches 96% of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is up in popularity: 53% support them today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I now receive news today on my mobile and I see them sorted out later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and significant institution.
It needs a considerable chairman - I hope it has found it.
Perry from Texas says that degraded tweet was not authorized.
A Tweet of the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a damning remark about the democratic district prosecutor, who is at the centre of criminal charges against him for abuses of authority.
The Tweet was deleted later and replaced by another of Perrys's user account that rejected the previous one.
A Tweet has just been sent from my account which was not authorized by me.
"I do not approve of the Tweet and have deleted it," he said in the later news.
Staff of Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perrys went out of the official user account, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavourable picture of the local prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn.
Perry put a veto on a financial promotion of their office when she refused to resign what could lead to an indictment of Perry - who may be the 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweets reads: "I do n't always ride drunk with the three-fold alcohol mirror but when I do it, I put it on Governor Perry when he does." 
I am the most comfortable democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the direction of investigating the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the prosecution a political trick.
His high-ranking team of lawyers asked for the indictment of the case to reject the prosecution and argued that the law that was used against the chief governor in the history of the State of Texas is invisibly diffused.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in government funding from the State Integrity Unit of the State based in Travis County and, in cases of state corruption in Texas, refused to resign.
This veto gave rise to a public complaint on the part of the watchdog group on the left.
Perrys official user account is often updated - and sometimes it is famous.
After he finished in Iowa during his presidential election in 2012 during his presidential election, Perry went on speculation that he would stop him by sending a Tweet of a photo of himself to the jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina!" 
Berkeley explains housing market again for "normal" 
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market returned to normal levels in the South-East of England.
Homes in the capital were hotter and subject to huge increases in prices, which the Bank of England experienced as a result of the widespread fear of a credit bubble to set limits on mortgage lending in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of Berkeley, the founder and CEO of Berkeley, said: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal levels of transaction since the peak of 2013," adding that this provides a" stable action environment.''
The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn because foreign buyers pushed to the capital.
According to information from the Katowice Office, prices in the urban area rose by 18.5% last year, far beyond the average rise in England and Wales as a whole.
Average sales prices at Berkeley's private, cheap and student offers increased around a fifth in the past year and were £423.000 million at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them were also deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric by a possible "Villwithholding" before the general elections of next May.
Over the past week, London's real estate agent, Foxton, warned that in the second half of the year, in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April would also lead to lower market growth in property sales as it was at prices.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a drop in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the property market is cooled.
Hamptions International, a different real estate agency, revised its forecast for the rise in housing prices in London to 3% by 2015, on the basis of an already weak domestic market.
Transactions in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington have now fallen by a quarter by year, according to the real estate agency WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, since the due amounts for futures amount to more than $2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well planned product at the best locations remained stable and remained stable as a result." 
In June, the company reported that it sold 3.742 new homes until the end of April - nearly one-third more than the peak of 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40 percent every year to €280 million, accounting for around 18 percent to $1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the Annual General Meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year is expected to comply with current market expectations.
Analysts consistently estimate the annual pre-tax result of €450 million.
In the afternoon in London, Berkeley invested around 23.96 £in London trading.
Naked pics of Jennifer Lawrence released by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence will perform at the 85th Oscarlet.
Naked pics of Jennifer Lawrence have been released online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of other 100 starlets.
A representative of the Stars of "The Tribute of panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and that the hacker complained about" flagrant violation of privacy.''
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
In addition to this, there is a wide range of images that were first posted on Apple's photo-Sharingpage, where the alleged "master list" of the hackers includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Wess and Mary-Kate Olsen, Buzzfeed.
It is not certain how many of the images are real, even though Wish, a star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who watch the photos that my husband and I recorded years ago in the private environment of our house, I hope you are so happy with you," wrote Written on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and" Vicathas'' however made that it was in the photos of pictures of her and tweetete "These so-called nudicks of me are fake, people.
Let's take care of it and we will take care of it.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop stars Ariana Grande rejected the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed novel novel on love and the letter "J.
They fated, so they could describe it best; they got slowly like a piece of cardboard that can be left in the rain.
Occasionally he said to him that he is too serious, tiring, hard to take and perhaps somewhat scratch-friendly.
And he shook his hand.
He knew he knew it.
He was stale, as it was in Igel, yea.
The final victim of this confusion was a very beginning affair that was more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life, and it may even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a treacherous delicate beauty with untold hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more isolated and weary than port Reuben.
She had come to the south of the south with the elderly who held Kevern for their aunt, who had inherited a lot of land in a wet but heavenly valley with the true name of Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leck, in the bathrooms there were still spiders, neck necks had left their marks on all windows and they thought they were all of them, and the garden was monitored with weeds that looked like huge cabs.
It was like the house of a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
In addition to this, Kevern had an unusually warm spring afternoon with Ailinn that enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon that brought the country to the service console that brought the country to the service console when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old track of a long forgotten black entertainer whom his father was pleased to hear about closed shutters in the house
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
It was not forbidden - nothing was so rightly forbidden - it was simply not played.
It has been successfully eclipsed as the word becomes obsolete.
The general taste of what the rules and regulations would never have been and how the people of books choose the millionth memoirs, cookbooks and love romans have been chosen, so they chose the ballads when it comes to music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and took great feet in a grob-comic Serenade.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained it and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That was what his father had always done to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father had played with his own father, so he had told him.
If you add a word to a J without putting two fingers on your lips, it will cost you a Penny.
It was not a very funny game at the time and it was not very funny now.
He knew he was expected to do so, and that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard any of them.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
The improvising was no longer modern.
It was only room for a single "if" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be sure where they would end.
That is what the mind is.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was music-driven mind.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz of the semi-secret collection of his father.
But at least he did not need to explain to Ailinn that Fats Wall was black.
In her age she was probably not reminded of a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints have been considered.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of talent in society - thanks to the fate of fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origins were suitable for entertainment and sport by temperament and body design, which is why they swore and ran them.
People who originally came from the Indian sub-continent, like nature, were blessed with electronic talent and were looked after with the task of ensuring that no family remained without working service.
What was still left of the Polish community took care of the seduction, which was crushed by the Greeks.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levante whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly when they had done WAR will take WAR, who will be accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of fire, fearing that the flames would consume them next - laboratories and Shisha-pipe restaurants have been opened and they have been depressed
Each according to his skills.
Since she only heard ballads, Ailinn was finding it hard to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could ever be made.
Music was an expression of love.
"They are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
He returned too much, but the neglected garden gave him the false feeling of security.
Nothing was able to overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbonated leaves.
Ailinn still does not understand.
Why would your father love to love it?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in its present day.
She already thought it was somewhat odd.
"It seemed to be a joke of him," he instead said.
She shook his head and hid Keeping's view.
There was nothing else around the world than their naked black hair was.
There was nothing he would otherwise have seen.
"If you say, I say to them without conviction.
But that does not explain why you are presenting it to me.
They seemed to be honest about them.
Is my feet too big?
He again looked again.
Your feet do not do so directly.
Perhaps your ankles, a small bit to use
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
You hate them?
Of course I do not hate you.
That is the only thing we have to say about it.
He could say "I love you" but it was too early.
Your thick ankles are the very reason why you catch me," he instead tried it instead.
I am a bit perverse.
That was not true.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the calming charm that was needed to tame the cruelty of jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be Kevern who was.
Despite its friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was born in red and rose from their deck chair, throwing the console and begging the wine they enjoyed.
The wine of wood is one of the most important in the world, and that is why it is not an excuse for him.
In their excitation they seemed to tremble, such as Palmnel in the storm.
"and your Dickkopf is the very reason why I feel bound to you," said she
In addition to that, I am not alone.
She was sorry for him, both for the inconvenience of his words and for the fear that was shown in their eyes when they opposed him.
Did she think he would beat them?
She did not tell him of the life of the cold northern archipelago where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was in essence as it was here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke here as it was there on the shore.
The same confused men with even thicker and more thicker of WHAT took WAR when they had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers went from tavern to pub, and were always willing to raise the hand against a woman who would be denied or deprived of them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown them a big fist when they missed out!
You first knead - the most used word was the most commonly used word for an erotic appeal between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - they first kneel and then beat.
According to Kehl, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the crackling was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through their bodies.
He rose from the deckchair like an old man.
They felt likewise, but their grief surprised them.
It was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew themselves.
She saw to him how he was a man who complained about something that he himself was trying to do, just as he saw from a room on the top of the floor.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some raised their hands against them.
A man turned from her to bow his back, it is ashamed, it is defeated and without fighting spirit it was why it was a sight that she seemed to know well when she was not able to remember the only time she had ever seen once before this day?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
For a number of years before the events that I have just heard, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for the public mood, was working on a short lecture on the continued violence at low and medium-sized levels in precisely those parts of the country in which their reduction, if not abolished, would have been most likely to be expected in view of
"Many have been done and much has been done, and much has to be done," she wrote," wrote about the innate aggression of a people who led thousands of wars, and most of them have won, particularly in the remote corners and valleys of the land where the sweet breath of human kindness historically has seldom been felt despite the high rise of cherries between
But there are some features that turn out to be inevitable.
The higher the church tower, the lower the passion it continues.
The population is crying out of hearing sentimental ballads, taking part in stories about the difficulties of marriage and family life and claiming to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless, not only does the former crude of rural communities, as well as our urban fabric, remain in their hands, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious dispute at home,
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you Atheist?
"I think I do not need to say it," ESME Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Once again, ESME appealed to its right to privacy and denial.
Feminist?
Again, silence.
"I do not wonder," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbian or feminism.
This is an unbiased job here.
We serve a society that is unbiased.
However, certain types of hypersensitivity, which are perfectly acceptable and commendable in themselves, can occasionally distort results of how they are presented.
You yourself seem to have prejudice against the Church, and these things, which you describe as `underhand and roh 'could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a natural and vitality.
When you go further on what is happening, WHAT will be done, it will happen that if it were to happen yesterday, it would mean taking the country's essential life.
ESME Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head an LED font in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or longer.
Smile your neighbor, add value to your partner, listen to your partner, listen to ballads, visit Musicals, use your phone, use your phone, speak, tell you, tell you to listen, listen to you to vote, I apologise.
Talk is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to see," ESME Nussbaum replied with a quiet voice when she was certain that her predecessor had come to an end, and I say nothing else that we are not yet as effective as we are deluding ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves finding how we repeat the mistakes that were first done to DEM, which is what I was doing.
However, this time it is not the others where we leave our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed with the hands of a pyramid.
I would like to say something about it.
"They go too far," he said," If you are describing actions as "mistakes'' that our grandparents may have done.
They also go too far when you say that they have missed their "rage" and their" mistrust'' to "others." 
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone of your position that when we understand the past, as with the protection of the present, we are not talking about `ourselves' and` others'.
There was no "we" and there was no other.
It was a time of disorder; that is all we know.
"Of them, when we are honest with ourselves," I think it would be better for ESME to say that "no part of society can claim to be good." 
I do not accuse anyone.
Whether it was bad or good to do what happened has happened.
That was what it was at the time.
Nothing more needs to be said - we are in agreement.
And just as it does not have to be blamed, there is no reason to blame, if such eradication is adequate and if there is a way to wipe it out.
But what is the past if we do not learn from it?
The past is for us to forget them.
I would like to say something about this.
Luther Rabinowitz brought together his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said.
On the next day when they went to work as usual, she was driven by a motorcyclist who, like passers-by, was driven by a kind of "brutal rage" on the footpath.
There are cases.
Lesotho-military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Officials of the military in Lesotho are trying to plan a coup to overthrow the government and say that they went against policemen who are accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and said that the country's army occupied its seat of residence with government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Premier brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after he had reported threats of attack.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is de facto of no coup that, however, the military responds to the threat of "political fanatics" whose weapons are at odds with the police.
What happened this morning was that the Defence Forces of Lesotho acted after he had received several secret service reports that, within the police, some of the elements that were actually trying to harm some of the political and political young fanatics who were on the brink of devastating damage,," he said to Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that military action gave the impression of a crash.
Although no one has claimed to have hijacked the government by force, all of the reports agree that the defence forces of Lesotho so far show signs of a coup d'état," "said.''
Speaker of the military of Lesotho stated on Sunday that the soldiers were falling back to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, the Vice-Deputy Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the governance of Thabanes.
Thabane said that he believes that he has become the target for his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, since June, there have been major tensions, following Thabane's parliamentary meetings due to the divisions in its unity government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, in spite of the fact that the charges were different.
Production in the Eurozone on 13 months
The rise in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point of the past 13 months in August, followed by a carefully considered study.
In August, the final market purchasing cell -LRB- PMI -RRB- fell in August to 50.7, according to a booth of 51.8 in July.
An indication of more than 50 gives an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced breakdowns in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures coincide with the meeting of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to find a clear plan for dealing with eurozone's reluctant recovery and with the threat of deflation of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could give more details this week whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone in line with those made by Britain and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers became clearer," said Rob Dobson, senior economist in Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic nation in the block, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a kind child, as well as the descent of Italy of solid expansion to stagnation.
References to the fact that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanics of Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands no longer take effect are also not reassuring," Mr Dobson said.
The decline in industry probably fuels the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland where PMI rose to 57.2, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Head of Economics at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing cell stock market in the eurozone in August is that the sector will continue to grow." 
He added: In the eurozone, "producers in the eurozone apparently find their lives rather difficult, because current increases in geopolitical tensions, particularly with respect to Russia and Ukraine, are increasing uncertainty in the more difficult conditions that continue to rise in many countries.
This increased uncertainty has clearly affected the economy, in particular, with consumer confidence, and it is likely that a number of orders will be delayed or even cancelled, in particular large orders.
He said that it would be "increasingly more likely" that the ECB should start a kind of QE," although we suspect that will be limited.''
Since the terrible siege of the school, ten years have passed since the terrible siege of school, as the children of them are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 Chechen militias were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in Southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that the world shocked.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death at Greueltat in the classroom.
Exactly one decade after the appalling siege of the Beslan school in which 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned the heroic survivors last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the start of a new school year, that seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in abhorrence, and surprisingly transformed into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death at Greueltat in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will follow them forever.
Your biggest hope?
The fact that the war that Ukraine is now searching for - with children like them - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed during the experiment to climb back into the shattered school sports hall
She has been photographed by the Russian star photographer and known by the Russian star photographer Dimitri and is famous when she only tried in her underwear to climb back into the broken school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused with her mother, Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
They both were believed to be dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me I should race for my life, but I could not say," Aida then said.
My legs were bloodied.
I stood by and climbed again to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them into security.
After a series of operations, she behaved completely, but yesterday said: "three months ago the pain returned.
I fear that I will have to operate again.
Some grenades are still in my knee.
Their goal is to become a dentist in order to help people, as their doctors have helped.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not disintegrate me," she says.
"It happened to me, and that can not be changed
Once in the year I always go to the sports hall to remind me of the things that stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on another day.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small and we dreamed of going to school.
"I do not want to marry until I begin my studies and my career.
I am thinking of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, even though the memory of each year becomes somewhat weak.
I am pleased that many people around the world are still remembering our horrors and we are so grateful for the assistance we have received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online as I go back to school, I think that many people will see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help ensure that it does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball believes that his mother is dead.
It was his first school day -LRB- Russians go to school for 7 years and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara -RRB-.
When he said more than seven years, "Mama told me I should go down when there was an explosion and keep their hands." 
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said unto him: "Run." 
Full of fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a crying baby who took his hand and fled through a ball gel.
His father, Vladimir, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said: "I could not save them." 
In reality, Tamara was slammed in the outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn, in the assumption that their son died.
After reunification she said: "I was crying for joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London -LRB- from the now acclaimed News of the World -RRB- to receive the title of a Barnardo of Children's Champion by the then-Prime Minister, Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is persecuting you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it becomes in my memory.
I still know that I threw all of my toy pistols straight away.
But now I can play computer games with guns, which is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, whom I played in the Court and who did not manage it outside.
We never say they have been killed or are dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially to the toy shop, where I was able to choose everything I wanted and I would like to go out in the open air.
But now he is scared about the place of Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered.
This horror persecutes you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me of it.
"I am so sorry about all those who are suffering from the horrors," said Damir, who worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I would like to help.
I will go to the police one day and hope she will take me next year at the Training Academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed you can imagine it?
I remember the terrible silence of the siege, there were simply no children who could cry and run around, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly reminds herself of her journey to London with Damir.
The people of London cried when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her Foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say to her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting you and her husband remember in London, and how the Damir and me helped.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borashsch and how she wanted to cry all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant.
And that was only one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so readily shared our pain and supported us.
As she said, "I always think that this world is not better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war now goes further and people die every day and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are precisely such children as ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or when they are working.
I simply know what these people feel the whole horror.
And I ca n't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir became a great and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
He is not looking for revenge, for example; he is not overwhelmed by the past Greueln.
I know he does not like to be reminded of it, but he has six close friends of the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and inflate the candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered among them - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa - the face of us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued all of his weapons and other military toys.
I can hardly believe that I was so safe for a couple of hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got on the legs, I looked, and the hell around me looked around me, with the body parts that lie everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy in that hell could not have survived.
"I remember that I was calling him" Damir," run away.'' But I was so sure he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he has gone.
And so life, unlike many others, goes for us.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the Greuel of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan-survivor Georgiy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, on the right to see an image of Georgiy today
His bloodied face was frightened of fear when he ran his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, had dismissed him for his first school day before she rushed to bring her elder son, Vladimir, to university.
"I left the Court for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not entirely, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgiy managed to survive.
The closer this date draws, the more severe it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think it is a long time, I think it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days persecute me forever.
Nobody will forget it - I promise you.
Insistent: The image of Georgij -LRB- left -RRB- was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue -LRB- right -RRB-.
I remember that Georgiy wanted to go to school this day; he said that he wanted to relieve his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the vine of Georgiy in San Marino.
Georgiy does not like the picture and it is hidden by us at home in the bookshelf.
I understand this, but I also believe that the people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgiy today said: "It is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we have ever experienced the truth.
People are investigating such tragedies over and over again and never get the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of these Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever see what he has done?
This world will become something of terror.
"I can not understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody will not want a war, which is how it happens?
For ten years we have nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares due to the siege, but then it became better.
I went back to school in 2004 and were afraid of every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
Therefore I always go to the sports hall when 1 September approaches.
I would like to pay tribute to my old childhood memories.
It is difficult for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I do not feel the sacrifice, this history is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not paint myself.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikwkaz.
I will be the heart of my heart.
My first election was an education in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not let us.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgiy Faniev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist
One wonder: Georgiy fanatics were trapped during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was caught in the sports hall and was sitting next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It really is a wonder that he was not killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," Georgiy, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, was unable to do so because of the siege because of its health damage.
It is still with me that it is nothing I have left behind me.
I am older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that they do not.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I really felt something better, but I can not forget it
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time I went again to the sports hall.
I lost awareness.
I will never return again and I would ask you not to tell you where I have sat in this famous picture.
Survival: Georgiy fanatics today, with a photo of themselves in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do n't like to think about or talk about it and they never asked me for the school.
Physically it is a good thing for me to do.
I should be cautious about my injured knee, but I can now go well.
However, because of my health, I was unable to study the secret service of the FSB in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have submitted my documents, including the medical input, and they have replied that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been behind me for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows." 
He said: "I knew I would never tell my children of my experiences.
Children should not know anything and, of course, they should not suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It is worse in my soul when the anniversary is approaching.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know that Georgiy will not go.
It has to be much more intense for him because he was there and was not.
I waited at home to help him and could not help.
I am grateful to God for being returned; here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It remains in us.
Georgiy is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept it if there is something so unfair.
He is a boy, he likes sport, but he can not participate because of his knee.
It has operated on a number of occasions, it can run, but it does not work.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but we can never completely overcome it and forget it.
We will always be following this terrible experience.
Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege and that only increases my pain.
I lost many of the people I knew well and that were expensive for me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God has been able to make, but my heart is crying for the ducks.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also widows who have never been married.
It is difficult to accept that life continues, even if you do not want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now close to our country and I almost fail to believe it.
We were once a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children are suffering, and I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and are still killed.
If we all go on and off these rebels - as far as we can.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was so made to be worn by a special raid on security
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is released by a Russian Special Command Command -LRB- left -RRB-.
She is now 10 -LRB- right -RRB- and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world held breath in 2004 when Baby Aljona was born to the poor by a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists allowed them to go, but in their cruelty they held back their 30-year mother, 10-year old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, three years of age, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has married again since then and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana that he has named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown to an intelligent and happy girl who say neighbours.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and will spare them all the memories of the tenth anniversary.
They will understand why.
Accusing men of crossing girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife have to go.
A 78-year-old man is on a pedestrian walkway due to the passing of a three-year old girl in Fife in court.
Gordon Steward is accused of having a girl on the transition to Memphis in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward has steered his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and hurt the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, was accused of being accused of the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set up the procedure for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a choice of devices.
The cheapest option is a water-proof point of And-Shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action-Cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition that are both for around $300.
I recorded these photos in a family firm with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment there are some rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are closed.
Also put your camera on the photos or videos you want to take up.
Some of the cameras and camcorders are equipped with features such as scenes and recording sessions to optimize the exposure time for the underwater environments.
And before you jump inside, check the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, except for 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our purchasing guide and the reviews of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots because there are many who will not fail.
Point-and-slot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images of action.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it under water, and the correct image setting is a matter of chance.
So you will take a lot of pictures.
When your camera has a string mode with which a range of pictures with slightly different exposure settings can be done, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
If possible, you will remain close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This will allow you to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less you will see.
Take a closer look at the objects.
This is also a good advice for the country, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad lighting conditions.
It is especially important when you work with an Action-Cam: These devices often have a fixed angle lens, which means that you need to be able to bring your objects closer to your objects if they are to complete the entire image wire.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As a consultative anaesthesia, he devoted his career to spare the sick both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife was a MI6-employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors attach importance to diagnoses and diseases, while the treated mostly work with something else: Pain.
However, one day in 2007 he was the person who began suffering.
"I did not like me," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulties getting me great.
While he fought with the griplike symptoms, he noted that he was impatient about his wife, Juliet.
"I want to do everything as soon as later," he notes.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt completely unusual and without cause.
Anything was in the air.
He asked my colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he had been to skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was.
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast that attacks the lungs.
As with most cancer cases, the exact trigger is mostly difficult to define.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer used to have been smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost every case, the trigger is an asbestos strain - contact with the fiber material, which is now seen as lethal.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disorder that can be ignored.
Asbestos is ultimately a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos was not used in Britain since the 1960" s when the industry voluntarily committed itself to failing to use it.
In places where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the substance - plumbers, construction workers, carpenter and shipyard workers for example.
As an industrial hazard from a different era, it hardly seems to be worrying today.
But that complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is now the culmination of a epidemic of mesh.
There are more deaths from Mesotheliom than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.
Annual Statistics of Mesotheliomi cases since 1980 and expected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are now experiencing the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years -LRB- in 1999, all types of asbestos were banned -RRB-, is the fact that a Mesotheliom is not developed for decades.
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not confined to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and often is, in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial limits, professions or old age.
The privileged bases, from elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not protected.
The parliamentary buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, these fatal carcinogens have already been identified.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber either.
It was indeed difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it.
"It looks like he wrote a lot of asbestos in the tunnels of Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years, a lot of asbestos." 
All - students, nurses, doctors and carers - take advantage of the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my elderly people will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer at least part of this question.
"Of the four doctors who have been educated at Guy's Hospital, who in the past five years have been living with Mesotheliom," he wrote in 2010 in a letter" I am the last to live.''
How many of us will we suffer?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 5.
This was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty per cent of all Mesotheliomos die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease is always lethal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of whom will we suffer?" 
Britain's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, is assuming that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic is expected to come to a halt in Britain, a total of more than 90,000 of the disease will be lost.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to whom stakeholders often turn for damages shows the extent to which the scourge of the Mesothelibre already exists.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer for example admitted that Janice Allen accidentally suspended asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them of the flagship store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she began working at M & S
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"In front of this," I've never heard of Mesotheliom, I did not really know anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought that would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the concept of asbestos does not relate to a substance but a group of six minerals.
The name stems from the word "Asstalform," a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly used asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof boards, floor panels, piping isolators, boiler insulating, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is, however, seen by the EU and the WHO as a "high health risk" with possible death.
Dangerous is the brown asbestos -LRB- Amosit -RRB- and the blue asbestos -LRB- Krokydolith -RRB-.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it was clear but indirect to suggest that this was one of the main reasons for the uniquely high trade fair increase." 
One of Marks & Spencer's employees was in the flagship store of Oxford Street, London, asbestos exposed to Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical Mesotheliot victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He has presented a study of the victims in which it states that "a significant proportion of Mesotheliome without known suspension was caused by work or at home by asbestos in the environment." 
A large part of these contacts is based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, who investigated the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service powers and pipelines behind the committee rooms of Parliament were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be raised by something as harmless as "strong air movements." 
MEPs are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Western Minster Palace would receive a "clean health certificate" , it is now undisputed that 1 billion will need to be spent over several years to renovate Parliament to modernise electrical installations and to remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, Members of Parliament will be better at the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green benches at Westminster
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant rules." 
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
All that we can do is to wait.
One person who has never been able to determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suggests that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have been working in a hospital where asbestos complaints were made," he says, but I can not prove it in my case
It is so difficult to remember all the places you have worked on and the data.
What he remembers is the day of the beginning of December 2009, when he got a kind of fever.
He was 45, and in the evening an operation was carried out in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
Suddenly it came.
I felt terrible.
I thought the journey to my house would no longer be created.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest of breast brought the skin around his lungs.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a Mesotheliom.
He did not go a month to work.
Doctors made X-ray recordings of his breast and put Pleurakathether to gather liquid from the lungs and test them in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without a diagnosis.
His health improved slowly and he returned to his job.
From time to time, the symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and severe breathing.
In 2011 a patient arrived with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesotheliom.
But now Abbott also does not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and worked directly with asbestos.
The combination in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened and his veterinarian brought his CT-Sscans and X-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after, after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a probe with a camera was introduced into the cave between the reef and the chest.
I am an optimist.
I mostly go on," he says.
To be honest, I was not so much concerned about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: "It was said to me that it was Mesotheliom." 
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesotheliom
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmily nurses, one of whom recommended to take care of a lawyer.
Only now does he consider the scale of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, particularly in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," says he.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are becoming ill.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes in hospitals under the earth were the most dangerous pipes, so patients would probably not be exposed to the substance.
But many people who ate in pedestrian tunnels from a building into another -LRB- such as Andrew Lawson -RRB- or into underground canteens -LRB- as Graham Abbott said -RRB- were most likely to come into contact with the poisonous substances.
It is evident that over several decades after the war, hospitals for patients may have been life-saving, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students set off their petals on asbestos mats.
And it does not just affect hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls, owing to its fabulous isolation and flame retardant properties.
We also have schools.
In fact, many people were likely to have had first contact with the classroom.
In all over the country, in thousands of chemical dogs, students have managed to turn their petals on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is often raised on websites now.
And meanwhile there are so many innocent items in our houses such as floors of floors or floors of asbestos by means of asbestos.
"It is a industrialist that is included in large parts of our property," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred in a woman concerned was the demolition of a horticulture in the 1970s.
So you can adjust how to pull your garden off.
The impact of diagnosis and knowledge that the disease is incurable is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and I tried to go further, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I will not experience another Christmas.
The greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he reminds himself of how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to include it," he says.
"I asked my doctor" How long have I?" 
And I still have around 12 months.
I remember that I thought "I will not see another Christmas.
That was what it was." 
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our lifeline mechanism - breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is one of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is raised and the fibres are inhaled, they can set themselves in the chest of the skin around the lungs.
Asthma fibres irritate the breast and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled nadelshaped asbestos fibres," Professor Tom Treasure, a heart of Thorax, changed to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed it to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
Once the asthma reaches the lung tissue, Treasure says they are pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is from the beginning of invasiv.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well in Mesotheliom.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, hotter.
Some say they are worth trying.
Treasure denied that.
"It is not possible to cut the breast," he says.
They do not come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, in chemotherapy, cancer does not say very good, but not healed.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott was in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and advice office for contributors to his diagnosis in four years of his diagnosis.
"HI, cancer central," he found himself happy with calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and has still been very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and are expected to extend their lives by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, he managed to make things appear in a more positive light." 
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunsky, the heart of the Thorax specialist.
"We had an advantage by not being able to go further, I simply called and got an appointment," Graham said.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and would have to wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is critical for Mesotheliom sufferers in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments inevitably fail, many face another financial concern - the future of the families that they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan by Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is very dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that you realized that a very small burden was a health risk.
And here companies" negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually set their case, but it was not what Morgan calls "full compensation" , because Lawson was unable to prove with absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, a spokesman of Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s." 
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos Can be removed
In fact, it is a huge problem for Mesotheliom sufferers who seek compensation, a huge problem that can be associated with deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job, for decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that time is for them, but they are certainly not with the plaintiff.
In response to this, this year there has been a clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliomers to lodge compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a fund of 350 million supported by the insurance industry for all who were diagnosed after July 2012, have been able to provide evidence of contact but has been unable to sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiff will receive 80% of what a court might have been able to give to them in a normal damages process - around 120,000 pounds.
Around 300 successful applications in the programme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many trade experts, thinks that 350 million £was a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says.
Mike Penning, the Minister of Labour, also admitted that the law "is not perfect." 
But both Peacing and Morgan said that, in the face of seven deaths per day, rapid action is necessary.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliac Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After its first consultation, Long-Lazdunsky recommended an operation of which he expects to be positive in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that can present long-term survival for more than five years of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
That is something we see again and again in patients.
There is something that lets you go on.
When you catch up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott resigned from the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancers around my chest.
I have just been 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That is a matter of life.
Once again Abbott has six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no trace of tumors.
But the process is physically and mentally demanding.
They need to think of practical things - about the money when I am no more, or my wife shows how the messenger time setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
They need to look ahead.
As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it is not always easy.
"For parents, that is difficult," says he.
It is difficult to know what to say and how much should be said.
When I got my first diagnosis, I said to my girl that I would have a disease with which I would not be old.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and unstressed.
They told their friends and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was more cautious.
She did not say much.
Such discussions are something that all cancer patients need to undergo.
But such talks are not inspired by hope, not from a trail of hope for survival.
The disease -LRB- as Stephen Jay Gould finally does -RRB- provides a solid security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong the right to government election; protesters swear retaliation.
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2014 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This is probably the long-running protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists slashed planning and mobilization within a few hours of announcing them.
The decision of the Chinese National Congress allows communist leaders to reject all of them.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing promised.
You have lied to the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the Hong Kong elections would be chaotic.
Since 1997, when Britain has returned to the Chinese to control Hong Kong, Beijing has promised to let its residents choose the seat of government from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because there is direct suffrage for the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that China's leaders remain in hand in hand.
According to a new clause, only candidates with love for the country and love for Hong Kong are to be allowed.
The decision follows a summer where some of the largest and most recent protests in Hong Kong have taken place for several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement whose organizers have threatened to bail out the financial district if Beijing does not allow for genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within a few hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central-supporters had gathered together in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and that they planned them in the coming weeks.
However, they made no reference to them, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers informed that the movement "the occupation of the central district" should only be considered as the last resort, an action that should only take place when all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and not a different choice.
We are sorry to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security measures, including police forces and barricades, were considered on Sunday in front of the government building.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The supply of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Moreover, the fear that Hong Kong's values will begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing is growing.
Some criticized the Occupy-Central-Movement demonstrations, as they threaten business operations - Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they are going to continue," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We do not want to fuel fears that Hong Kong will come out of control.
That impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media recently reported about the democratic activists in Hong Kong as a subversive agent controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists were holding an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 000 000 people took part - more than one-fifth of the electorate in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school leavers in the US is now transferred to universities where freshmen are offered with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to present Britain's first luxury travel service for students of today.
In order to be able to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also pointed out that the service had a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise need to train their habitants in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options we look forward to ensuring that students reach university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A business spokesman said that no new bookings were required, since the service had only just been introduced, but they added that "students would book the service in the coming weeks." 
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of €9,000 a year, there would be a market for this offer.
Students today differ in their expectations and expectations from the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to give a great first impression, and that is what VIF can do.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as it was.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the NUS for higher education said: "This offer seems to be completely separated from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who are starting this month with their studies face a crisis of the cost of living because the available financial assistance in the form of loans and grants does not keep pace with the highly volatile bills for the easiest ways of life before they can ever think of spending thousands of pounds for as little a day as the arrival in the student residence.
Feminists criticise racial questions and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo..
The participants rocked their hands in the air and sling, "hands high, not shooting," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussion of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators place gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
While tensions in the Middle East rose, Perez saw Perez that white women turned their answers of white women to 100% of the race.
In comparison with the answers of black females shortly after the shots of August 9th, the personal essays with titles such as "thinking on Ferguson of a white woman" and" feminism does not only revolve around the oppression of women'' relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I do not think many people in feminism will find many people who speak of white about white, and they speak in such a high fashion that they said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they should express it.
For English professor Coritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems to light that black American women are exposed every day but that are not seen as women's "women" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish something funny on me and my partner on me and my partner and I get 150 Likes everywhere," said Mitchell.
When I say something about how ferns in their own country stand under siege, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk openly about a relationship?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues neatly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women are now joining the subjects of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were born and the explanatory statement was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynchmurder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white women voters such as Susan analyzed the country in the late years of the nineteenth century and found that the fight for the right to vote could only be successful for each of them: Women or the Black.
"You took the decision to stand up for the right of women, and the right to vote for blisters should come later," said Hattery.
When you look at such things, you are well aware of why white women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to be organised against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was born nearly 40 years after the original request for the help of black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of time in which white feminists played "Fangen" with the problems that black women have had to address for generations.
"would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to educate a child so seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who built up their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means are now trying to understand what that means.
The well known white feminist activist Gloria Steiner went two weeks after shooting Michael Brown on Facebook and published a concrete article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian of the Guardian, where she called for more protests by white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race, which are very different in public surveys -" wrote Stone." 
Although Stone stands for a more intersectional feminism in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of their commentary on the subject of racial violence in America are blunt.
Christina Sommer, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole Feminism" said to She The People that young men in the United States, particularly young colored men, are" far more vulnerable than their sisters,'' but Steinems's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and hispanic men, there were annoying reactions by many feminists, including Gloria Stone.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is pressing for the mainstream feminist.
After the US Border Police took up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's southwest border of this year, the issue of immigration reform again comes to the surface - this of this time.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that, for a new view of the subject, they should merely publish the stories of immigrant women as an essential piece of women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of the employment visa goes to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are reflected in women's organisations of women," she said.
"pig house" in Ipswich stands for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed from real estate brokers when it became clear that it showed a great sponge that had been made in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house, including a pig that had his head on a sofa.
Real estate brokers Connells said that the pig is the pet of the owner.
"The photo was published erroneously and now it was removed" a speaker of the company said.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the earlier gathering as a "unique one-family house with one bedroom." 
Although the broker removed the image from the website, it seems to appear on advertising material.
The sale of the house was of interest to the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
After Lottowin, SWCity Harvey is home to a new millionaire.
A lotto player from Harvey is this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner who receives almost $1.1 million from lottery education on Saturday.
For the second time in five years, a newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the draw of the first division, after 1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner will have to report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit for talking is in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city does not talk about anything else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought such a gain could occur.
Eight WA-winners celebrated profits last month in the first division, a due end for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a married couple from Belmont had previously achieved the megaprofit of $7.5 million prior to that.
The winner of the winning couple had played for twenty years and said that the profit would give them the opportunity of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly 85 million.
Leonidas asked for the gladiatorial arena
It is not only the gladiators who stood in Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
However, the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defaulted the rain and the early cold and made themselves enchanted by the historic spectacle.
There have been a colourful series of portraits, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the Roman period and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was without a doubt the martian-fighter group of the Gladiator School of Amor Mortis, who used every period of time to demonstrate their robust campaign art in the arena of soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" has proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presentation and has sent his men in the ring to become the heroic bidder in various gladiatorial bands.
First of all there were the "Provocators" on the series with square marks and short as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest of arms, with a short chunk and a head of arms, as well as iron gladiator helmet, hook and armguard.
In addition to this, the performance of the "Retiro" that took place against the" Secutor,'' which was fought against the "Secutor" , has been one of the most impressive of all.
When heavy metals collide, the shields of the shields fly through the arena and a fear and tie could be found around the health of gladiators.
After all, the impressive "Summa Rudis" , the muscular referee, had an always attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and the culture of the Roman period," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the Association of Friends of Roman Canal, the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation time, for one day the amusement park became a "Oppidum Roman," a Roman town, such as Vice-Chairman Claus Wehage in his greeting.
After all, the Romans brought not only the war and conquest of our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire.
The remains of these were also seen in the Roman day, for example by "Aquädukt marble" of the 11m high and 1400 metres of Roman canal bridge that once stood on the roof of the hotel.
The Frontex company once and now opposed the supply of water and energy supplies, and Petra Fricke, head of business, knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of then." 
Ralph Heiliger, professor of engineering from Rheinbach, has also confirmed this.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations of 1894 as well as bricks from the original Hyposmoster, the hot air temperature, which once heated the Roman villa.
It is also impressive to see the footprints that had been left by Wolf and fox two years ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the office for the conservation of soil in the Rhineland had been excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Rhine in Rheinbach.
It was found that the walls of an economic building were found to be used to dry crops.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A series of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass laboratory, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the fall of the Germanic people in the then Roman Rhineland, which suspects Morscheiser.
In addition to this, children are also employed by the Roman winds of wind, in a similar way to today's mill game, as they once wrote the Roman students their names with metal handles on wax boards.
At the stand of the Roman thermen of Zülpich, the children were allowed to make mosaics at the stand of the "Rheinbach glass museum" and use a heavy wheat mill from Stein at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim to serve the flour for the bread or the cereals.
With the Roman tour that was produced by two cold blossoms, visitors passed through the amusement park, also passing the impressive booth of the Municipal High School, which presented the results of their "Römer-projectwochen." 
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also present the Roman period of 2014, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the local and historical associations, as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Association Club and the League of Secrets of Oberbachem you will see thematic hikes, a lecture, cookery and guided tours for school classes and the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary of his work on the vital Wachtberg will tell us that plants are presented as living thinkers from the Roman era and a funny lesson in the event of international understanding between a group of juniors "Germanen" and occupied Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme in the context of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, often visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be experienced again.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation to the Fund of the Bercumer Matronenheiligalism will be remembered in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic of West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are walking away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to West Africa's economy.
The crop rotates on the fields that mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has been severely affected by the region.
Some international companies are also at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic," states the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia's the hardest hit
"It is a total disaster, we lose very much money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
On the market, only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola can be found.
Liberia is hit hardest by the virus and, on its own, more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, health officials said that the disease was in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died and thousands of others arrived.
Foreign companies attract employees
Companies operate their operations everywhere in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel company are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying the regions affected.
Local merchants and farmers are also reacting: Only a few merchants are still leaving their homes to supply supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia that are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans used for export are being eradicated.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food Is short
"The people will spend less less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for West Africa.
Man, for example, who is usually going to the market and who sells his vegetables would prefer to stay at home.
The population therefore receives the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: Food becomes scarce.
On the markets, stocks of basic foods such as rice are disappearing.
At the same time, the region, which is highly dependent on international companies, is threatening an image of images with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies are avoiding the area for a long time, Philippe Hugon says of the French think tank Iris.
The crucial question is how far the virus will go and how long the virus will continue to spread.
Investors can get the impression that "it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia," Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the hard-pressed state budgets of states
The disease also burdens the already strained state budgets of the States concerned.
Moody's rating agency fears that their budgets are severely stretched by high spending on health care and, in addition, of the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the countries affected by $60 million -LRB- 45 million euros -RRB-.
The impact is also felt in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
It is true that the oil region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected.
But elsewhere, many people already remain at home for fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced.
Celebrating its 50th Anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Berngau is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
Preparations for the 50th anniversary of the 50th anniversary of 12 to 14 September will take place at Schützenverein Tannenwald.
It is planned on Friday, September 12, a great entertainment night with the group Dorfrocker.
On Saturday, at 6, you will be able to shoot the great Bon.
After that, in the big party of the evening, there is the "Stoapfakzer Peak" in the big party.
The brass band provides the music for the music.
Highlights on Sunday are the feast of God and 9.30 p.m. in the parish church and the grand parade at 2 p.m
In the afternoon, there is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gauge.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 firm damen with their Dirndln.
The chapel of Chillon is the Berngau brass band.
The patronage was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary General Albert Füracker.
The original name "Protector of Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907 when the Association was founded on March 21 for" social entertainment by way of an exercise in the consumption of children and small bananas.''
The Nazi regime imposed the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964 there were 19 young men who were born on the 30th of April at the Inn of Lukas the "new" Schützenverein" Tannenwald'' of Berngau.
Charles March and Adolf Ried led the club as the champion of a difficult initial time in which it was primarily a matter of finding a club locally and installing the shooting range.
Already in the fall of 1965, the Schützenverein in the "Leininger" inn with two teams started to compete with two teams.
In the following years, the sports grounds, which were meanwhile organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st.
For the first time in 1980, Rudi Meier has achieved the magic belt of purate and the magic line of 380 rings.
Just as the performance of the active fighting has increased, the number of members has also been positively developed.
After failing to comply with the requirements of a modern contest, under the leadership of Johann Rinn, under the leadership of Johann Rinn, the former Board of Management decided to establish a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis." 
After a working performance of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988, the priest of Strasser for the new protectors gave the church blessing.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaushoot, coupled with the solemn consecration of the new Schützenfahne in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary of founding.
A Böll Group was set up in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became a member of Böll.
A great challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the direction of the Bavarian Böll Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the club last year modernized the premises and the shooting range at Berngauer Hof and thus brought up the latest state of technology.
11 teams in Round Futures
It is also possible to see the sports performance of the Schützenverein.
In total, 11 teams are currently competing with the rest of the races: Six air fighters, an airgun team, a sports gun, a youth and two teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Keller rose up in the District League of 1 in the round 2013 @/@ 14 of the Gauoberleague -LRB- highest league in the Schützengau ANB -RRB-.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml went on to join the Gaune League.
In addition to the shooting range there is a tradition of events such as buckets, carnival and royal ball.
In doing so, they are also used for festivals in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when he returns to the race.
Tony Stewarts' return to the track ended half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart fought the Wall for the second time against the Wall after his right front burst in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car to the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chairman Chad Johnston said that his 14-year-old team is disappointed, but now he will concentrate on the race of next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We drive to Richmond and we hope that we can do better there.
Stewart already returned to the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I received good results with good hopes of a good result," he said:" It was simply not working.''
After a long time after the second accident, Stewarts' car was loaded and the team was packed and was ready to leave.
He was born in New York City, New York, where he was born in New York City.
He decided to return this week and to win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in pursuit.
He returned to his job, during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. He went on a track to confront Stewart during a race.
On Friday, the authorities said that the investigations will last at least two weeks for the cause of the accident.
No decision has yet been taken about whether Stewart has to count on prosecution.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start to 12, Stewart was already in the first 10 shortly after that and was temporarily in four.

Searching for Friends of Dance
Simply try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Head Lisa Neitzel -LRB- on the left -RRB- are looking forward to contributors.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups in the TV Jahn make it possible to create full day classes in secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have been severely decimated.
Now we are looking for more young people for a sport that is healthy and that is great fun.
In the two jazz and modern bands of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance band Spirits, are only nine children.
"Three in the group of 8 to 12 years, six in the group of 12-year-olds, tells the 20-year old.
With more athletes, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance very different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can play on Thursdays between 17 and 6 pm or Fridays between 17 and 18.30 in the dance sport at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
"The training regularly begins with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
After that various choreographies will be taught.
Jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no form of form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical music to sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the conviviality is not too short.
"We also eat dinner, we look forward to dance movies and we have already stayed in the dancing room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and still do a lot for your own motorsport.
When jazz dance is not the case, it can also be found in one of the other offerings of the TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always take part in classes in the areas of children's dance @/@ jazz dancing, Bambini band, videoclip and hip-hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who likes disco fox, long waltz, Viennese waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and tango can walk by and take part.
Bulgaria's prison guards across the whole country.
Hundreds of prisoners of prison from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest in front of the Court of Justice in Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to restore their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of receivables that is to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours and are calling for a return to the former 24-hour layers.
Despite the meeting between the union of prisoners and representatives of the Court of Justice, no agreement was reached, in spite of the national Bulgarian ratio -LRB- BNR -RRB-.
The negotiations are continuing, and the Director-General for the implementation of punitive measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov of the BNR was split.
The protest of the prisoners is expected to be supported by members of the Ministry of Interior of the Ministry of Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk Airport.
In Ostukrains, the prorussian fighters continue to advance on the march.
After severe fighting in which Russian tanks were allegedly involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, has abandoned Luhansk airport.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously had humanitarian consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without giving details.
Pror-Russian separatists shot from aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, prorussian separatists have once again fired a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
In fact, around 100 soldiers were injured or killed in fighting in the region of Donetsk, according to the insurgents on Monday of the Russian agencies.
Reducing Coast Guard ships
The insurgents also claimed that, for the first time in the Azean Sea, two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard have fallen.
The Ukrainian border protection confirmed that two of his boats on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol were under fire.
While seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev said to the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several places in the area of Donetsk were brought under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the Ukrainian Contact Group meets today.
In addition to the representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, there should also be a representative of the separatists from Ostukraine.

NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia as a result of the planned deployment in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukrainian crisis.
On Monday, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels that NATO is committed to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO boss, however, accused Russia of "a flagrant breach" of the agreement.
"Today we need to face reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," said Rasmussen.
Documents and opinions from the Russian side show that they consider us as enemies." 
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that the NATO presence in Eastern Europe will need to be strengthened.
A "Readiness Action Plan" at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that" we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is needed,'' Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow for New Gas Talks
According to official indications, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new discussions on the settlement of their gas strikes.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still waiting for the European Union to decide, whether it is also a representative of the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not been producing fuel from Russia for weeks.
Last but not least, the EU Energy Commissioner has mediated Günther Oettinger between both sides.
Ukraine warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe has around a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, of which a large proportion of them are flowing through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks the word of power: Toll is going to be "very clear" .
Now the Chancellor is once again committed to doing so.
But it is not a licence for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the toll on cars have made the CSU increasingly difficult.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken of a power word for the introduction of a passenger car toll after persistent opposition from its CDU.
"To make it quite clear that it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the party leader on Monday after the meetings of the G7 leaders in Berlin.
On a detailed model, however, Merkel failed to do so for now.
The black and red state of government is called "certain parameters." 
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt -LRB- CSU -RRB- made `a proposal and is working on it now '.
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its "no" vote against a toll on all roads.
Merkel also stressed that Chancellor Schäuble -LRB- CDU -RRB- also put himself constructively in the deliberations for a bill.
Beyond the topic, he also spoke with Dobrindt about other ways to enable more private capital to invest in infrastructure, for example in the area of broadband.
On Sunday, on Sunday, Schäuble left an uncommented of a "Spiegel" report, while his house validates his own approach to paying motorway investors to toll revenues after the election of 2017.
Mr. Horst Seehofer then warned against developing in the cabinet a toll plan against the lead minister.
CDU's Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition treaty has never gone from trying to garner all of the roads and the federal roads," said the Federal President of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Therefore, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to discuss the subject again.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDUHA associations in Baden-Württemberg and from Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is the fear that tolls will compromise small border traffic with neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had asked for it because of the toll criticism from the ranks of the CDU coalition.
The left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-toll is dead," said Party Chairman Bernd Riexinger of the New York Times newspaper -LRB- Monday -RRB-.
"The toll is failing by the minister," Dobrindt intends to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads that are to be launched in 2016.
According to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners must not be burdened by additional charges.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll on vehicle tax.
However, the model must not penalise foreign drivers in accordance with EU law.
Misdiagnosed genetic disorder
A British says that she thought as a result of misdiagnosis for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived nearly her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another illness.
She actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease -LRB- CMT -RRB- - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnosis is a frequent problem for people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Around 23,000 people in Great Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, insecure gear and curvaged toes.
The disease is also suffering from deafness and pain; the disease is incurable and progressive, meaning that the symptoms are getting worse.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she would suffer from Friedreich-Ataxie -LRB- IAs -RRB- - a disease with very bad survival chances.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before becoming 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is more than 51 years old, said: "As a child I knew I could not do the same as the others.
I fell constantly and everything took me longer.
I was never able to go with the other children rollshoe or skateboard and in the school it was often because of my way to go and go.
Rodgers said that in the age of 13, after several operations, after several operations for discharge of their Achilles, and stretching their feet saw their ambulance when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from IAs.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I told nobody but went home, searched for the illness in the library and wrote to the FA-Society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and I got a terrible panic.
I thought I would be with 18 in a wheelchair and I would die with 25, and in between all my abilities would lose.
I got it alone with me and I planned my own funeral.
She said that when she was 17, she realized that her skills had not fallen so much as they had imagined and they asked their doctor.
He was easy to stand and bent on me and I said, "my love, I do not believe you have it," otherwise you already like it in a wheelchair.''
I believe you have something much less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests it was found in the CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt myself to be a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-A-ware month to draw attention to this disease.
D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireman since the closure of the former army of troops.
For nearly ten years, the former troop level in Münsingen has no longer been shot.
In spite of this, every month of deadly ammunition is found at the heart of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they will have to be blown up on the ground.
A deafening bang on the explosives halludes about the core of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot of Münsingen, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation, fell.
Since then, the 6500 hectares of grounds are at the heart of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open on 13 marked paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burdens on business in Washington increases with economic recovery
Economic recovery means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax cuts for firms in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published study of the past week was accelerated and firms in the area of Washington were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland, and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local government and local authorities in the fiscal year of 2013, a rise of 3.8 percent compared with $26.6 billion compared with 2012.
The state-owned and local tax burden of companies rose by 4.3% last year to $671 billion, compared with 3.9% in the year, and it was the third year of growth after the several years of declining decision in 2009 and in 2010.
Government taxes rose more than local taxes, accounting for 4.1%, such as the study carried out by Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a fiscal policy group.
More than half of District, 56 per cent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 per cent of its income comes from companies.
With 28 per cent, Virginia has the lowest tax revenues from business.
Much of the rise in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the real estate values of companies, researchers, which led to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years of growth of less than 1%, are saying.
While much of these gains from large countries such as California, New York, and Texas were born, the process seems to take place even in Washington.
Companies in District, Maryland, and Virginia, together with more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes in the past year, compared to $9.6 billion, compared to $9.6 billion, a rise in the course of a year by 4.2 percent.
But the seeming recovery in property values in Maryland is not so effective in boosting state and local tax revenues because real estate taxes amount to less than one-fifth of the company's tax cuts.
Companies in Virginia and DC pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, a large proportion of real estate, particularly in the tax area around D.C., is either in possession of the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay for property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery of tax revenues by companies can not be compared to the recovery of the property market
Corporate income also seems to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported $2.3 billion in income taxes compared with 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland accounted for $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not rise evenly in every three places.
The rise rate in the district corresponded to 4.1% of the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher than 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an above-average tax rate of 4.1 percent.
Virginia with 6 per cent has significantly lower corporate income taxes -LRB- in all three of them -RRB- corporate income taxes -LRB- in all three -RRB-.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and the District at relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower state-owned and local taxes on business would be required and in general there was a better fiscal climate than in Maryland.
In the study, the District was not investigated.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina has passed legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will drop to 5% next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
Meanwhile, it seems to be better for small businesses in Washington, and they therefore pay more government and local taxes, in other words the recent study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that most of the small businesses are organizing - in District, Maryland, and Virginia rose by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, a significant faster rate of growth than corporate taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes throughout the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in the general income tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014, compared with the same period of the previous year.
However, the area of Washington may lag behind when the federal government's spending cuts affect the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German Beer for Guangzhou
Hopfen and Malz - also in China a popular combination.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's twin town in China now wishes to see a brewery and also hopes for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Guangzhou's sister city of Guangzhou - is the urgent desire for officials in China.
"We would be pleased if a German brewery were to settle down in our town," said vice secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when he visited a SPD-delegation in his city.
Again and again, in the course of the conversation, the functionary of the ruling Chinese Communist Party came back to this cause of the 12-million metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also mentioned in Germany in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
That is why people also saw the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessische SPD-Chairman Thorsten Schäfer Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, said to the host that he would be listening to Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"For beer it does not need much: Good water, cereals and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party upper in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already includes Mr. Li Li, who flattered the host.
As a result, Guangzhou with Schäemer Gümbel joined forces with red wine, which was served at dinner.
The Chinese brand of Tsingria goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed in accordance with the German purity of purity.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-leader Li.
Lufthansa offered the flight earlier, but dropped in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," said the local politician.
"Business relations between our two cities are continuing to grow." 
At the moment, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in the province of Hunan.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for flight connections.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, expressed this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," said Schäfer Gümbel - Chinese vice president Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, who gave birth.
Well-maintained partnership
The leutard Vice-President of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to attend a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already in the Main, but he was not yet in this function.
He only took office this year after his predecessor was promoted from office for corruption charges.
The local party chef Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against the corruption in the party and administration that Xi Jinping, Head of State, is pushing through.
The new leader Li Yiwei was working in front of his party career for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before he took office in Guangzhou he worked as a top manager in Fujian, where the car VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen town-twinning.
The combination of Guangzhou's 9000 kilometres belongs to those that are maintained by both sides, for example by means of a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis of Pearl Harbor, with its economic strength, is almost like the whole of Hessen.
In the next year they want to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "expresses the thumbs" 
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since it was delivered to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter is now hopeful that the 81-year-old man will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We are all pressing the thumbs.
According to her mother, on Thursday, after an emergency, her mother was admitted to the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday.
Doctors consider them to be deliberate and more accurate until they are more satisfied with their state of affairs that continues to be described as "serious." 
The reactions came from many quarters, including in the form of an overwhelming online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaner and rising wages
In future, more stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners who are trading in trade today.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new dust cleaners from 1 September receive a label where the purchaser can see key data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, the number of nitrogen oxides is increased in the category of "Euro 6" .
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolters: They receive a single minimum wage of EUR 10.25.
Amazon Buy Twitch for 1.04 billion
Amazon just confirmed what information was reported on Monday morning: Online retailers - and video products, and many other things - buy the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion -LRB- $970 million USD -RRB-.
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected to take it over, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Tout was decided by Google for a cool billion, and the cooperation also appeared of course.
Tweed, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it was quickly to become a platform for players who wanted to release their bravoids in games, a "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The Twitter interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which the better known -LRB- mostly older ones -RRB- games give a paint of secret science are already popular on YouTube.
It is precisely that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Tweed, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy TFS has been recorded something that is a bit bored; it is a textbook example of established technology that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not born, since the company reported that it was prepared to pay much of it like Amazon.
All that we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet shear, President of Tft: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get faster." 
Another secret is, to be honest, the incredible success of Tweed.
For snobs like me who say they would like to play sport than to do so, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes from watching others play games.
It is one thing to look at a friend at 3 in the morning to see while they are taken off by Resident Evil and watching something else to see someone who is shooting 20 times a year in Call of Duty.
You can now see all these games now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games of today are Ego games, so without their own control over the eye view, they can be a good recipe for headache.
I admit that the rapid runs in which the Roger Banners of our electronic age are completing whole games in record time are entertaining.
But, as long as there is not a game or a bit of humor, his Twitter channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do I know about what I already know?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It is hard to imagine that TFS will be integrated elegantly in Amazon Instant video that will allow YouTube to take it easy.
But Twitch has something that each company would like: Thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, shear, saying, Amazon and Twitch believe in the future of gaming, "and the medium does not show any sign of a contraction, nor is there any sign of it as a spectator sport.
On the castle of the castle there was a lot of work on Saturday.
The concept of the organizer was correct.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday night, it is estimated that 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in the Burggarten.
At times they had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel is the light and the fun.
Out of two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name of Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is supposed to radiate the brightness of the day and in the evening by various shows.
Well, and it is fun that comes from my own.
This was evident as early as the evening when the first visitors set up for the Open Air.
The organizers were promised a feast for all generations.
And they have managed to do so.
Around the farms on the Burggarten meadow, Salzwedeler as well as guests from the closer and more near surroundings had made it pleasant.
They followed the first live performances, wippts with the foot in the beat, and they enjoyed cool drinks - in short, pure relaxation and enjoyment.
And this right across the generations.
While one of them was lying on the white sand on the beach bar, others used to be in a quarter of wine in the vintage, while the offspring at the Hüpfburg Castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the case of the children, the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had to do all of their hands in order to become the crowd and to create imaginative creations in small faces.
The bigger took advantage of the Kicker or took part in a skateboard workshop that taught the Goodfoot-crew out of salt tins.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m he raced to the visitors, especially when families were looking for space and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not detract from it.
"It brought more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a" success on the whole line.''
That is why there is nothing contrary to a repeat of the big party in the coming year.
Although there is no need to work on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear in a first assessment of the popular vote on Sunday.
He said he said that, in the meantime, they had to be stopped.
Apparently the security company had been booked with too little.
The result: Some who have already paid did not come onto the grounds.
The feedback was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of around 1200 visitors in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound technology.
He was one of the most important of all of us.
The technicians were unable to achieve a fairly reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha-Lock could not be set up because the tents could not be brought to balance due to a pile of tyres.
"In the next year, they will be," the organizers say.
The premiere of the Amula-Open Airs was greater than possible by the number of visitors.
And that is what happens in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will be withdrawn for the first time but which must be eliminated in the second edition.
Also in the social network of Facebook the organizers will have to register their criticism.
"sorry, but for 12 euros you simply got more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"You have unfortunately taken over a bit on you," says Ele Zimmermann.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I think it is very good that some of them not only try to fool themselves, but also try to put something on their feet.
"," Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.
Now the organizers have a year of time to put a stop to these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum
They are not expected to do so.
Instead, the used component is waiting to be used in the striking building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation radar Tira, the shell, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
With a diameter of 47.5 metres, the new radom will be a little smaller than the old one.
But the size still remains world record.
The final step towards completion of the new shell is the Kappentausch
The upper quarters of the old shell are separated and taken away with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell will be set.
If the weather is involved, the action should go on stage at the beginning of this week.
Participating in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge
Isabelle Roberts from Britain cried so much when their icy waters were cast over the head to hurt the bone structure of their face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge went painful.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had made the Ice-Bucket-Challenge so much that she gave up the jaws.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain created so much when their icy waters were cast over the head to hurt their face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I was the act my jaw remained simple," said it to The Mirror.
Ice water is thrown out over the 20-year old year.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that did not go, the jaws was lost and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this also and made them laugh almost in the pants, but I had to get into the notation.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was delivered to the hospital to restore the jaws after they took part in the virals trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of pages on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the clubs of Burgundy pull together again again?
Last but not least, there have been twenty of them between the two Wolfratshauser of Burgundy.
Now we are thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Castle of Burgundy, led the project in the French Guédelon.
Only a year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the castles of Wolfratshausen.
The positions so far seemed to have seemed to have been dealt with by the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and the possibility of reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving: Discussions are to be held soon on joint action.
This confirms the local councils of Torsten Sjöberg -LRB- Burgverein -RRB- and Herbert Piffl -LRB- Burgundy -RRB- on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and I proposed that we be able to sit down," reports Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of these clubs would be able to pull together in the future.
That is how we can see results that can be seen more quickly.
While the members of the castle were in front of the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until the end of a reconstruction of the Castle in Bergwald, the castle of Sjöberg is at the forefront of the town of Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, Chairman of the Friends of Burgundy, was very pleased with the call.
In spite of the fact, he has been in contact with the people of Burgundy since the death of Dimal.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in the middle of September.
At the moment the club has around 40 members, according to the 74-year-old.
"After the death of my friend, Richard Dimbath, we have allowed the club activities to rest first." This" thinking period'' was required to "consider how it might go on." 
According to Piffl the new chairman will then go into conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the people of Burgundy could also take a current mood within their groups.
There are currently no candidates for the Presidency yet, Piffl says.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to stand because he has his domicile in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to continue working on the project.
The various points of view of reconstruction will probably remain in mind in the near future.
He praises Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already highly advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to the high participation of the population and volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I, too, was sceptical about it.
But in the course of time I got more and more to believe that it makes sense to push the project forward." It can be used to create a "one-size-fits-all'' for the city of Flensburg.
Otherwise, there is nothing to be desired here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believing Piffl to believe.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction simply on board," he hopes that the Burgverein on this point may be moving.
Their goal of documenting history first is "important and good." 
After that, we could look further.
A clever way of saving in university textbooks
Since the cost of translation books for many students is more than $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder's Fast-branch graduate his clever austerity.
He found a temporary system for books of students of higher semester and offered nominal compensation to delay sales.
"My mathematics book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19 who visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He gave $120.
The division informed that students on average spend more than 1,200 per year on textbooks and academic material that there would be various cost control options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the scrapers are increasingly the solution of the choice for students.
The renting of textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can often use a book for a semester, often at a much lower cost than when they buy.
Neebo Inc, which runs more than 250 university bookshops, stated that the renting of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that around a quarter of the books in the College-bookshops was rented in the last spring day, Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are bought by the National Association of College Stores in Campus bookshops.
Here is the unique place for the best deals.
Online Buy
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are in the campus-bookshop.
The ninth edition of "the"
Need to Buy
If one of the notes of other or normal usage tracks does not make sense, used books are a good option.
It was used in Chegg.com to have 93.9 $.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduation student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent 42 Cents on Amazon.com for a second edition of "Strategic Media Decision: The Business End Of The Advertising Business." 
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, Director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether earlier spending is allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenses can often be acquired for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Bloom.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Hiring
The renting of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, think about returning them and do not want to keep them after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly bought book.
For example, for example, a student could hire "Compus" for the duration of a semester, around $20.
Inform yourself about the regulations of the business you are renting out, as well as the penalty charges that may be incurred for writing notes.
Tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalty charges can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-Books instead of traditional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of retailers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg, you can rent "Bailus" for around $61 for 6 months.
Bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best offers, since many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and technical textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look at it.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School recommends the ISBN code for book pricing because you can be sure you can find the proper book book.
And before placing an online order, you should look at whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that delivered four weeks delivery time and paid the full price in the collage book.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" 
"The Expendables 3" of Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the US, while Sin City: A Lady to Kill For only $12 million in his budget was $70 million in his budget.
The film "Sex Tape" that is tailored to Cameron Diaz on the opening weekend only played $14.6 million, while children's films like" Dragon's easily made,'' as well as the revenue.
An article by the Telegraph-film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children's films the lack of quality could be the cause of the films themselves.
In 2014, Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films, describing" dragons slightly made in 2'' as pure "functional" fantasy.
However, in films for a somewhat older target group, it seems that the quality of films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for every summer film that was shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th July 2013 and the current year of at least 2000 pages.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and filmmakers and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators suggest that development is due to changing visual habits and to the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on the jungle film that is soon appearing at Disneys, said to Hollywood Reporter that "I think the times are changing." 
We have to accept it and not try to kill the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash flow of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated revenues of $1.2 billion in streaming content, nearly twice as much as last year, when turnover amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on the filming of comics and predicted a "nuclear meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his bleak prophecy may well contain a true core.
In the summer, Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World are other representatives of the film industry.
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash flow as simply "cyclical" and he said to Hollywood reporters:" The next summer will be the biggest summer in the cinema race at all, and no one will worry about business.''
It was a step in the right direction than a few years ago that removed the 2 day table tennis area in order to tighten the league division.
Now the German Table Table has taken the form of an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
As a result, anyone who does not rise up has gone off.
For example, while gods of the highest team of Torpedo in the Upper Alps have avoided the descent, however, in the coming season there will be only 5 000.
Torpedos's fourth class will remain in the regional league, in spite of its spectacular margin in the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Dutch league, as are the boys of the SC Weende.
SG Lenglers and the TorpedoReserve compete in the new association of directors, and in the National League there is no more to be represented.
For the ladies, TTV Geismar plays in the League of Representatives, the Torpedo-Second in the national league.
What looks like a better district class is now the new district of South.
Here we present TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the district league, as regional representative of Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the class of TTC II, Rot-Weiß, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III, the class of the class of the ladies at least starts at least in the sense of determination.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are part of the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen @/@ Wöllstedt will run off in the district league.
With the nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The district league of the SCW boys, where Torpedo II still starts, is not complete.
In a county class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded Regional Association, the two of them start a circle of nine teams.
In the west season, the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengner II are many of these.
Among other things, Sattenhausen @/@ Wöllgraben, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play a role in East Season.
The Dame-Circle League consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllgraben ausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of Osterode where there are no ladies and gentlemen on a circle level.
What is striking is that none of the six 2.circular classes reaches the required strength, where the innovative and rotating circle will need to think again.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, around 150 people in Cardiff joined Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has followed developments for the weekend for us and has spoken to demonstrators who have traveled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains
Two young Buschwanders were released with the rope winch after they were caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW for the night.
The 16-year old girl and the 19-year-old man broke in Blackheath shortly after Sunday afternoon in Blackheath.
Worried relatives cried around 20 o'clock the police while the two failed to return home.
A search trup from local police and rescue services broke down and the pair was found around 23 o'clock in the vicinity of the Bridal Veil Waterfalls.
The girl had fallen to his knees and the man was toppled and had beaten his head.
Rescuers stayed overnight with the pair and they flew on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable condition with a ambulance in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
The around 1000 demonstrators were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said information minister Pervaiz Rashid.
After half an hour, the station resumed the broadcasting.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged equipment in the editors.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the Heads of Government who accuse them of voting.
The police told us that, around a kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there were around 3000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
After hospitalization, a policeman was injured.
On weekends, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured and protesters tried to invade Sharifs residence.
You are calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, the powerful military called for a political settlement of the conflict following a meeting in the army headquarters, without wasting time and using violence." 
Furthermore, it stated in the communication that "the army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state." 
The escalating violence has incited concern to military intervention, which has already been used more often in the past.
Protests made by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Preacher Tahirul Qaddafi have continued to take place since Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qaddafi had called on Sunday to desist.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qaddafi spoke similarly.
Khan accused Sharif of having won parliamentary elections in May last year through fraud.
Qaddafi calls for the resignation of Central and the provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and launch new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are employed to protect the government quarter.
First of all, the demonstrators had peacefully before Parliament to invade Khan and Qaddafi in the weekend to invade Sharifs residence.
After two years of the season, Hütteldorfer ranked three in the table.
With the 2: 0 on Grödig, a conciliatory end was done for Rapid for Rapid Week on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an interim head in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The sensation of success was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and Torchere Steffen Hofmann, who had three of them with green white in place.
Schrammel-dreamtor will bring Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid with the second season of the season to show the right response to the disappointment of Helsinki and achieve a successful experience in the country game slot.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his magnificent guide from the six-minute leadership of the Sixteenth.
"I thought I was watching the whole of Frust from Thursday and I did it under the bar," the 26-year-old said.
When Schrammel met on 13 November 2010 for the last time in a Bundesligapartie, that was still for Ried.
That is why the first team of champions in the Rapid-Dress will remain in special memory.
"For me this is something very special, I am from the Rape," said Schrammel.
Owing to Mario Pavelic's short-term pelvis, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and made his thing very good.
He has enough experience of being able to exercise this position too.
The Tor has earned him, he has already done some Assists this year" and he praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also supplied the flanks to 2: 0 by Hofmann after an hour that finally brought the decision.
After all, the guests would have been able to write.
"We were lucky enough to be lucky today," Schrammel, who thus played on the breakup of performance and results in the past few weeks, also said:" The results did not vote, but the playful was always good in comparison with last year.''
Barisic even said that "in many games it was better than it is today," against" the strongest team that played in this stadium in this season.''
The first 3-point since 26 July has therefore shown that the team structure remains intact despite the above: "Today my team has shown that it is in character." 
For him, it is not so pleasant that we have finally played zero again." 
Much of the work during the country play period Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger there are several reasons to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl, and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting gates, making the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget it," warned Barisic, who lost in the past three days with Bates and Pavelic players who have been very stable in recent times.
For this reason, the country should be used to "lick wounds and a bit in the physical area," Barisic explained that there are five U21 selections in his ranks.
One who is particularly interested in the pause is Captain Hofmann.
He rolls over for the team, goes about pain.
Especially in this difficult period, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," he noted Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before their confusion in the 68th minute not only the structure, but he also achieved the second gate.
For the 33-year who completed his 350, it was the first hit of the game since 2 November 2013 -LRB- 4: 2 on the admira -RRB-.
Hofmann: "Do not believe that now everything is good" We surely have a bit of luck, but at some point the happiness also has to come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
He warned, however, for concentration: `Do not always see it in black and white.
In recent weeks we have not played as badly as it has been explained.
However, we must not believe that everything is good now.
He was unable to dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team which I can help very much at the moment.
I think of them in certain stages," Hofmann said.
Val Coach Michael Baur had little to accuse himself and his team.
He regretted the rapid opponent of the magic wand, as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40 minute that referee colleagues had wrongly failed to recognize.
The only reproach I can make to the team is that we were not specific enough towards Tor in some stages.
We have had too little qualifications here.
Defending Maximilian Karner seemed to be similar: "It started badly, but we found it purely and even made a Tor.
In general, more would have been said.
There is Ruh
We found a mighty tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "My piece of Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these trees still exist in the county; the depicted copy is the "scourges" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A long walk down foot leads up to the about 600 years of old oak.
It is over Koppeln, basalt stone and basalt tins.
A little bit below the quarry of Bauersberg, for a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, it stands.
The natural monument is the natural monument, which extends beyond the other trees of the area and reminds us of more than eight metres of an American tree.
A small Buddha on a tree suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only references to the names.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has specially consulted the Bishop's Archive and asked elderly people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what they had to say about the scourges.
The result of his research was the rather sober statement for the name.
So, until around 80 years ago, the people of the world were supposed to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the laborious and liberated fields of land.
At the foot of the tree there is the ascent of exhausted breeders of animals.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows, indeed, there are indeed herds of goat.
The area is also part of the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, and Schneider has further found out.
You should be careful when you enter the stone collections, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for Crusaders.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is hidden.
There are other ways to reach the direction of Hochrhön and invite you for a long walk.
Where is the Wasserburg Castle?
However, a Wasserburg, which will be sought in our next task, is rare to find.
The mirror in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the county that would suit the construction of the building.
Where is our "little bit of luck" ?

After a week of weeks, Italy's premier and European leader, Matteo Renzi, won the nomination of his Secretary of State of Federica Mogherini as the head of the EU foreign policy last week, and she is the successor of British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, like the pro-government newspaper La Repubblica, also regards his appointment as the favourite Mogherini in the government team as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He is also expecting a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to ensure that the leftist party base that is becoming increasingly popular with him will remain calm, because Mogherini is associated with it.
Compared with conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and as President of the President of the Council, Poland Donald Tusk will be the dominant opinion in Rome to ensure that a political balance is achieved.
After all, the EU's head of diplomacy will be the deputy of the President of the Commission at the same time.
The outstanding approval of the European Parliament is certain to be certain.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU by nominating the 41year old politician of the ruling Democratic Party -LRB- PD -RRB-.
The optimism of La Repubblica is that for nearly two decades, Mogherini, the leader of the party, has been able to show the "enormous challenges" for their ambitions.
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then Democratici di Sinistra -LRB- Left-Democrats -RRB-, who in 2008 merged with the Catholic Centre Party of Margherita to join today's Socialist PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth -LRB- European Young Socialists -RRB- for three years.
With the election of 2001 in the Party Council of the Left, they went to the high party politics and worked in the foreign policy, where they became their leaders soon.
It was known by studies on NATO's deployment in Afghanistan with a troop contingent in Afghanistan, with contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini his Secretary of State.
If the PD once again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country that contributed to more than 40% of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, as in PD-circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
Recruitment in Brussels, which has too little diplomatic experience in the EU outside, is therefore lacking in the PD.
In Brussels, in particular by Poland and by the Baltic States, Mogherini's realistic accents to the crisis in Ukraine are being traced back and diffused as a "anti-poverty course." 
It is in favour of South Stream, which the Russian company is operating from the Russian company, to be transported directly to southern Europe by Russian natural gas, serving the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi began his term as President of the European Union in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow on her first visit to Moscow.
Photos that they showed with Putin at Shake-Hands were recorded with indignation in Brussels, just as they invited the Kremlin boss for a visit to Milan for October.
On Monday, a total of nine young people began their apprenticeship at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg.
Among them is a Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In four years of training, the new employees will be working in the future: Electron -LRB- three trainees -RRB-, mechatronics -LRB- two -RRB-, tool mechanic -LRB- two -RRB- and procedural mechanic -LRB- two -RRB-.
All of the trainees from the District of Schwandorf are: Tobias Braun and Thomas Buchl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Farnburg, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel carefree and Sebastian Zahner from Pfremd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the apprentices of all ages as well as the instructors will go to the Oberammergau team, where there is a full day hike and rafting on the program.
The company has a population of 435 with a total of 950 in the world.
The number of trainees for all ages is 27.
The socialists in France should "hold the mouth and put France in order," said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet building has come to an end with the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty and he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain on his side," he said with great applause.
As the Prime Minister said, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite intense calls for a relaxation by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Hollande urgently called on his fellow socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the minister of justice, sought sand into the transmission in which she appeared in a meeting of breakaway Socialist Members of the European Parliament and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future." 
Marine Le Pen, who is the right-wing leader of the National Front, vowed the permanent graves of socialists and said that it could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old does not survive a summer.
"And the new will not survive the autumn or winter," he said Le Pen was opposed to supporters.
She reiterated the reputation of her party after the dissolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that he would stand out in advance as the winner and be willing to take part in the government.
France's ruling Party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was in the EU elections in May.
A survey on Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76% of the French thought that the Socialist Party was under the risk of disintegrating into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences of Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose their patience if the new Socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel fast that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise briefly in front of a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion
According to the experts of the industry, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, the third largest crusade company in the world, will lead to the acquisition of the Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruises of Prestige Cruises, as well as its rich clientele, while with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd -LRB- RCL.N -RRB- and Carnival Corp -LRB- CCL.N -RRB- is in competition.

Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the electoral decision.
A pective group waved near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly adopted a framework law that would allow only two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates will first need to obtain the majority support of a nominating committee that is expected to be filled with pekingites.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be elected, and pro-democracy activists have made it possible to turn their threat to their threats and to destroy Hong Kong with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has been a controversial issue in Hong Kong for a long time; and Chinese party leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper in which Chinese dominance was set out in June on Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands of thousands of people marched into the business district of the city and organized a sit-in there.
Lis interrogation is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Foreign Office Office in Hong Kong.
The vice-chairman of the Committee of Legal Affairs of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Office for Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted in the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they will meet in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Up to the final stage of the 150-year old colonial government in Hong Kong, there were no democratic elements.
Putin calls on Kiev to admit "state expectations" 
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday, the Ukrainian government claims that the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country will take hold, immediately after negotiations of the breakaway region of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later stated that Putin did not mean that it would be part of Russia under the control of the separatist territory, but its status towards Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiev government on equals with the pro-Russian insurgents seems to fit for the strategy that he seems to have pursued since the start of the riots five months ago: Assistance for the separatists in taking areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region to become an alliance with Russia instead of with the West
In an interview with the state television channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the reconquest of areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were held in March and April after annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
In recent times, the Kremlin and the separatists have described the region as "Novorossija" or" Neurussland,'' a term that reminds us of the pre-revolutionary shining times of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of Ukrainian politicians" campaigns for the elections on the 26th, and while government groups attack civilian communities in the territories held by separatists, are hoping to be seen in their illusions in advance peace talks,'' reported Itar-Tass.
He said that "we need to talk quickly about detailed discussions not only on technical matters, but also on the political organisation of society and for the state of the State of South-East Asia to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood should be seen in the context with greater autonomy, which has been discussed since months from the Kiev leadership, to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern areas the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
It is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, as Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it is about an internal conflict in Ukraine." 
Clarifying the Kremlin speaker to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks highlighted Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, unlike the direct development of the Crimea, where the majority of 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much greater difficulties in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk to the eastern half of the year, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys before the conflict have led to a large majority in terms of remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy that has been raised by Russian diplomats on international fora would give the regional governments of Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that links Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula of the Black Sea, which was annexed five months ago, is the port for the majority of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on the inauguration of June 7, the Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that, after a new election, the Ukrainian legislation should consider amendments to the Constitution that give the relevant areas greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, having been accused of arming and burying Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing followed after another incident by the rebels in the past week, after Russian troops and tanks over the previously peaceful North Sea region invaded the Baltic Sea.
The separatists that Russia supports took over in the mantle that, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Nowoasovsk.
That is why massive civilian and military preparations have started to be established by Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants lying between Nowoasovsk and narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.
On Saturday, at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels, Poroyan asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on a point where there is no return," she warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take concrete action; the leadership required the draft of further sanctions against Russia that should enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers last week in the Donetsk region to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, said on Saturday in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk on Sunday were divided on Sunday against 10 Russian parachutists who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko split on Sunday.
Nutfotoscandal about Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his annoyance about hackers, who probably have stolen Gabi Grecko's and the Who's Who is who who was stolen from Hollywood.
The film city is in turmoil after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have appeared in a hacking scandal about celebrities on the Internet.
The hackers who are responsible for doing so probably have more than 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star of "Tribute of panem" and superstars, among them the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, allegedly, private photos were allegedly made public.
On the list there are 101 celebrities.
Edelsten, who died with Grecko last month, said to confidence: "It is disgusting." 
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and shared with others.
According to reports, Grecko, at the time in New York, said a news website said that Hack "is disgraceful and that the people affected felt" hurt." 
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures in which she is at the top of the pool.
Palmers' film works include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ: "It is an appalling violation of privacy." 
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "Played images from a mobile phone is nothing else than the sale of Hehlerware." 
From a purely legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
On September 8, Radler, Jogger and hikers were supported by the Association "Help for children with cancer." 
The tour, which was a torment for them, is an easy workout for the other.
Everyone agrees in one thing: It has been fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of Oberurseler Brauhaus drove yesterday with the wheel to the Feldberg.
For the good purpose.
He is able to easily remove the small muscle of the muscle, especially since he personally brought a valuable insight into his participation in the 8th Radeln on the Great Feldberg in favor of the "Help for Crebsktigen children" -LRB- Frankfurt -RRB-.
It is a great thing.
"I now know I can - it is fine!" 
Small glasses on the way in the applause curve?
Snow if I had stopped once, it was the same as that which I had been trying to do.
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in Upper Austria, many of the 718 participants of the 718 yesterday turned to mountains and they were close to the exhaustion, but they were happy on the plateau.
Others, by contrast, found it easier to overcome the good 11 kilometres between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
After 45 minutes without breathing, after 45 minutes without breathing, the goal of understatement -LRB- "Every bunch of professionals is the goal" -RRB- proved to be half a professional after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also drove the track in a slide, as well as Nina Kuhn, press spokesman for the town of Oberursel, who, together with Frank Grüneisen, had gone along the way.
The "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge for the two triathlete athletes:" This is about Charity, we like to go with it - we would have made it anyway today,'' according to Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy -LRB- 12 -RRB- went down to Oberursel in the morning to put it back to the height.
In the morning at 9am, the Frankfurt Florian Zierz swung in the saddle at 9am, "made" the Feldberg two times to roll with fun to home.
It was fun to have "Fritten-Toni." 
For the head of Oberurseler cult kiosks, bike tours through the Feldberg are easy.
He had hit 40 minutes with his 6.5-kiln wheel.
It is a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to do so," Andreas Balzke said.
The trained Mainzer says he is an ambitious racer.
He has to do so, because he was on the way with the "fixed balance" that is also racing bikes, but without a circuit.
The fact that it went up without a wheel showed not only the 20 hikers who went up on the White Wall and the hop distance to the summit, but also a jogging that comes with a cap on a cap with weights behind him.
He said: "The kenn" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled rail that he trains the sled of himself'' said:" The man is therefore in a sense of his own sled.
The 718 participants - and thus many of them - had been sent to groups in groups in the morning.
The trekkers will take you around 9.30 first.
It was followed by the first cyclists and runners around 10.
Five minutes later the first mountain bikers were left.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association of Radeln on the Great Feldberg, gave the starting commands and wanted the participants to go a nice trip.
For next year he will hope that it will be possible to close the route to the Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
