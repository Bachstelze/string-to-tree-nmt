Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the rider drove it with 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic policemen in Karratha tried this morning to put a stop to a blue motorcycle after they had watched it as it left a petrol station on the Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver ignored the holding then and continued on the Burgess Road before turning to the bushland where the officials lost their eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person who responded to the description of the driver were later seen in a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha are accused of a 20-year-old man of non-respect for a holding as well as reckless driving.
He is expected to appear before the court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read by a hearing from the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of having raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked them while they were "unconscious, and that they could not signal consent." 
Webster is also accused of having a second woman at Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Highlands of Scotland on May 4, 2014.
Judge, Lady Rae, set up the negotiating deadline for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Putting it into line with the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights.
"When trade unions die, middle-class jobs die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud to present with the Civil Rights Act of John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law provides workers with the same legal opportunities for discrimination on account of the organisation of labor unions, as in other forms of discrimination.
Supplementing the national law on labour law in order to create an opportunity for discrimination against workers in the organisation of union representation in order to bring justice to a civil court for justice, and to receive compensation or penalty, is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative, at least according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states throughout the country, Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, expand and comply with labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of association.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarised autocracy of Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions have a role to play in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "workers" rights to unification and to collective bargaining and action are guaranteed.''
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff ordered the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers should organise themselves, and that they should raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly said: "the right to establish associations in order to safeguard and improve labour and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and any profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict or restrict this right are null and void; measures that target them are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights, drafted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global deal, Roosevelt and other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to preserve trade unions, or join them." 
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that human rights are human rights.
When that country became aware of how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union should then participate in collective negotiations as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - to be protected.
Since these rights have come under attack in America, it is very wise for the American ideal to remember that the working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.
How Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
As we all know, the workers" movement did not reduce the nation's strength, but enlarged it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History is reminiscent of history, and that is something we should do.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of protecting civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America big in the past, creating the promise of democracy.
Judge stops on a temporary basis that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force them to close.
On Sunday, a federal judge stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, telling lawyers that it would probably have led to the closure of all of the state's five abortion clinics.
This measure, which was applied by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, to law in June and entered into force on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out abortions to acquire a patient awareness of patients at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that, for the time being, the doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions while seeking such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue working in accordance with law as they seek to obtain these rights," Federal judge John degravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing is scheduled for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
The decision that has been taken in a series of judgments against similar measures in a series of judgments welcomes the decision that has been taken in a series of judgments against similar measures, urging doctors to take so more time in order to obtain the right of hospitalisation.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana miss a rotten law that wants to take their health and their rights to them," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who, on behalf of three of the state's five clinics, took the law to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors of the two clinics that did not join the complaint and also requested the right of expulsion.
Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a Texas law which forced most of the clinics left in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that doctors' right of expulsion requires unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion believe that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some also welcome the effects of the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has patients with patients sharing access to reproductive rights.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced not to carry out abortions, this doctor would no longer be afraid of his safety, and the group said.
In their arguments against the judgment, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the implementation of abortion, whereas their applications for patients' rights would be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates caused by ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James sent a video for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a greater risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians who identified ovary cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent after diagnosis were still alive.
The research guide Susan Jordan of QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote areas, the risk of death during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDIE: New drugs might slow lung and ovarian cancer.
The researchers studied medical care for women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman influenced the chances of survival when it came to diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing preoccupations, and social and economic status.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote areas, the risk of death during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a belated diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in major cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services, in order to counter the distances, it proposed an improvement in the service of frozen doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women to their place of residence as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, showed a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and emphasized the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33, learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres to regret falling home ownership
The decline, combined with the increase in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause gardens to lose tens of thousands of pounds each year if today's young consumers after a study of HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach "the age group for garden products." 
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount people spend with home for their garden.
The increase of people who live in highly urbanised areas without gardens, popular processes, park grounds, and falling garden size are further factors that threaten the industry, which is estimated at £5 billion a year in sales.
In the London area where, over a period of six years, the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61% to 43%, the least expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can not draw plants
Guy Barter, chief gardener consultant for the RHS, said: "Container farmers are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can carry their plants with a move." 
The HTA report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the "golden age" of the horticultural trade as a result of rising house owners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, when it came into being.
He also predicted an improved market situation this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April of last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clerical Tahirul Qadri in Pakistan, continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators have climbed the state television station PTV.
Minister for Information, Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed protesters from the PTV.
The transmitter opened its operation for about 40 minutes, but it is now broadcast again.
At the same time, around 3,000 demonstrators attempted to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About one kilometre away from them, they came together with sticks and stones, had clashes with security forces.
The police put in tear gas.
The demonstrators called for Sharifs's resignation, but this is rejected.
In the meantime, the army of the country is calling for a political settlement of the conflict, without wasting time and without using force." 
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state." 
The military has an important role to play in Pakistan, and has played back more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan pretends to have cheated Premier Sharif when parliamentary elections were committed in May last year.
The protests have escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to invade Sharifs.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appointed US diplomat on the report of espionage
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed the senior US diplomats in the country with an account of a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the business of the US embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that that of the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, shows that Turkey was a major activity for the US and British intelligence agencies.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hit the importance of the report and said that all major countries had been spied on each other.
One of the earlier reports that Ankara also targeted the most important security service in Ankara has caused much irritated reactions from the Turkish Government.
Warning strike: Train drivers threaten commuters with consequences for commuters.
The nationwide warning strike of the guide on Monday evening could also affect the movement of persons in NRW.
The exhibition stand announced for 18 to 21 hours covers all transport companies throughout Germany, including long-distance, regional and rail transport.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the transport of goods.

Said the chair of the union of the trade union of German locomotives (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect a great deal.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the transport of goods.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything it can to keep its impact low.
However, the GDL did not say where she wanted to strike, so that it was difficult to predict the consequences.
Police of Magaluf indicted for corruption
On Friday, the prosecutor presented the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
The head of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested on charges of corruption of businessmen and barns in the infamous bandit of passangers of Magaluf.
The chief Commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, was arrested in custody on charges of corruption against him by several businessmen in Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs lie.
According to the online newspaper, Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented the office of the prosecutor for combating the fight against corruption on Friday, proof of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
Two other police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the allegations of corruption and are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily, ABC, reported that the angry casual owner said that the government's cronies have a serious impact on their business.
"It is no longer a matter of earning money, it is about survival," one of the businessmen said the court.
Let our livelihoods come from the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer, Magaluf made international headlines on the basis of a viral YouTube-Videos where a British tourist, who took place in 18 years of age, took place to 24 men during a tour to Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to put an end to the illegal behaviour of non-alcoholic tourists in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-free bar.
The Playhouse Club, where the fur event took place, has been forced to close a year for one year, while Playhouse and the restaurant called Carnage together will have to pay a penalty of 55,000 €($73.000 $-RRB-.
The resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular among young British tourists, is also known for a number of accidents under the flow of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing" in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first spring of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide to Adelaide.
Spring is a winter wonderfull with strong swings and strong wind that interferes with flights from Adelaide.
In the evening until 21: 00, there was a further 5mm rain on the town, after 6,6mm, which had already dropped to Sunday during the night.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, spirited shrubs, including one that began just before 20 p.m. and provided approximately 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
As winter took place last week for an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C
The bad weather conditions are likely to lead to the late landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
However, the plane was scheduled to land shortly after 19.30, but it was taken by a stroke - a sudden change of wind speed or direction of a short distance - and had to take off.
At that point wind reached about 50 km/h on the airport Adelaide.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to run on a second landing and that the aircraft opened at about 20.40.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible swings.
Matthies believes: High time for big blind
In view of the technical progress that threatens to turn our cosy home into high-tech switches, our column is Bernd Matthies with a very familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this falls my eye to the spiral cable that connects the listener to the telephone, and I think: Boah, like retro, is what is?
But there is a thought behind it: If the cable would not be, all listeners would be flying around the house in a short while, and that would be a lot more than that of retro.
Anyway, what is the case in the case of eceltronics?
No, typos: Electronic) sector is the rule that is purchased from today the electrical waste of tomorrow - it is outdated.
And anyone who still has a tube TV in the living room today simply says that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressure of the Ifa on Funkturm is again this week, we see our absolute incompetence over the issues of electronics.
The Laie, who previously dominated a washing machine and a CD player, now does not even understand the purpose of the devices that will be spread to him with unfathomable expertise of experts: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" .
So, is it still possible?
What is it supposed to talk to people who apparently voluntarily spread such Quark?
After all, for about 20 years, we have been demanding that we link our house.
This makes it possible for us to buy the yoghurt itself, so that we can tell us that when we leave on holiday on the Maldives, it is burning in the room of work.
Would it not be wonderful if we were to leave the office of the office out of the air-conditioning system for our early arrival on arrival?
Yes, that does, however, require air-conditioning.
But a dream will certainly soon come true: We lift our wristwatch, we say it according to "Saugen!," and at home the vacuum cleaner goes without it.
They are misleading.
Everything goes on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred," raunt a branch of industry, one can connect the washing machine with one of the headphones, the steam garer sends the weather report and the data brille indicates how long the pizza needs to be used in the oven, but what is of no use to us because
We also know from daily practice: If a modern device is really urgently needed, the battery is empty.
What is another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children returning to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near Gaza returned to school on Monday after they spent the summer in air while rocket and mortar stopped on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and closed the schools in Gaza while the area was recovering.
The school start brought a sense of pleasure and anticipation to the communities of missiles in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, staff of the "Pashosh" kindergarten that was taken by a rocket, before meeting the students of grenade splitter from the walls and slides.
"We have a bit of fear, but they're excited," said Ronit Bart, a friend at the Kibbutz Saad and her English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a bit funny" to suddenly return to school.
"These were difficult times, and we did not go from the house at all," she said.
President Reulin visited the border with Gaza near the border with Gaza to offer its support.
Until a ceasefire last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes, or their homes left their homes in order to move away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children have been provisionally placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza that is hard to see from the Palestinian attack.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that their knowledge is acquired and provides security
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday for an open-ended ceasefire.
The ceasefire has created an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, as is Hamas" demand for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel is calling for a disarming of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is likely to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them, and at least 494 children are estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these claims and estimates that at least half of these people are combatants, but they do not present any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other forces in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during fighting on Israeli cities, most of which are in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area, and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protected areas, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be open soon so that we can continue to learn how the children in the world and the Jewish children said," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl is calling into question NPD-prohibition procedures.
In view of the losses suffered by the Federal Republic of Germany in Saxony, Thomas Strobl (German Federal Constitutional Court) has spoken out in front of the Federal Constitutional Court for an end to the ongoing NPD-prohibition process.
Berlin - There should be an end to the current prohibition against the NPD in front of the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD performs worse than it was last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU-Landeschef in Baden-Württemberg, the" Leipziger Volkszeitung.''
This is a welcome development in the right direction, and it is a development that will help me to fight the NPD politically and not before the constitutional court.
During the vote on Sunday, the NPD failed at the five-percent threshold to be defeated.
A first attempt at a ban on the extreme right party failed in 2003, because constitutional protection had at the time the NPD leaders of whistleblowers.
In December 2013, the Federal Council issued a new application in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
The federal government and the Bundestag did not join forces.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
Refugees are now being placed in tents at the end of the day.
The headquarters for refugees in Harburg is bursting from all seams.
Now the internal authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross next.
Local politicians have been informed only briefly - they are little enthusiastic about it.
"These sharks foster further reservations of citizens and give the district politicians no way of playing a constructive role in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Chairman of the Green Group of the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party requests that the Harburg district administration at present provides unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The causes of overcrowding are the rush of seeking help - and the fact that the authorities can not supply sufficient places in institutions
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
Home prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to Monday's RP-data.
With this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices stood at 10.9%, more than twice the rise in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The Research Director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are introducing a two-tier market.
The figures for RP Data show that the home prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hard hit by cuts in government spending, and where prices rose by only 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lavless said it would now be possible to see an increase in the prices for the sale of real estate, which would be subjected to a real test for the next few months.
"If we consider the ongoing high rate of auction prices, a generally fast rate of sales, and the ongoing low interest rate of interest, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the new press, he contradicts statements by the Managing Director, Peer Medau, and attests to whom he is more positive.
The College's style is not, i.e. it says in the communication.
In the middle of June, the Medau family was verbally informed about the request of the university.
The statement that the plans were known only in July are definitely wrong." 
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not `prefixes or even decisions', but that there are` preferences'.
Also, the narrow roads up to the castle that are needed to get to the castle are less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
It was nine metres on the road and it was not mentioned.
It is about 5.50 metres, which is a metre wider than it has been so far," he explains.
The point of view of the Medau operators is that they do not want to be valid if they are only used by students of the university by students of the university.
It is not possible because this can be solved intelligently as it is with other public spaces.
Thinking to those who live close to home
The crèche, which is located on the ground and would lead to access to the park deck in front of their door, should not be affected by the president of the university.
On the contrary, it has to be borne in mind that it is not only a question of what we are talking about, but also the people living in the vicinity of the Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the secondary school.
It is therefore a matter of much more than the interests of the special interests of the people of Medau
Whether the criticism of the kindergarten of the School of Childhood, with expanding the street, would be entitled "the few of natural stains of cobalt," it is possible for the reader to decide for himself.
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the German State Building Office, wants to inform the town councillors about the development of the university by 2020 and discuss the importance of new development in this context.
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the kindergarten last week about the College's plans.
This means that access to the new park deck is not intended to take place via the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but through the Medau mountains.
With this, the narrow street on about one kilometre of length would have to be extended by two-track.
According to the projections of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would become ten-fold.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles every day.
To date it was not possible to speak about the project on the part of the town.
Glandorf comes from a Handball national team.
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt mainly has health problems for this decision.
It is not easy for me to decide, it has matured for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to finish my career in the national team," the 2007 World Champion announced on his Facebook page.
So, it is a balance of 167 countries and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement.
Because the massive backroom player for the league champion of Flensburg still wants to go on hunting for a couple of years, he no longer has access to the new German national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Islander, who announced on Tuesday his cadres for the country games against Switzerland, Glandorf conducted a long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have impressed me just as much, as they will also inspire my long-time fellow players and my successors.
But for my club I want to be healthy in the years to come, for which there is a need for longer regeneration breaks which do not allow for the current double exposure.
The left wing had to fear his/her career if he was in 2012.
Due to the problems of Achilles, he had been treated by a team doctor of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisan injection that had later caused a lot of inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional career and eleven years of national career go past no body without trace.
I have some health sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three causes of infection, which took place in short intervals in 2012, I have never really managed to get to grips with my blood pressure.
To achieve this, there are a number of other veiled complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I noticed that while I control my head, I can't deceive my body," Glandorf explained in the interview "Handball Time.''
For a comeback it would only be available in an absolute emergency.
"I am always ready to grab all the stripes," explained the two-fold family of family.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play handball.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have become rather humble when it comes to my health.
After my career, I would like to go at least to some extent.
In addition to the WM-Titel 2007 and the win of the Champions League 2014 he took 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) the EHF-cup.
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup of Champions with Flensburg.
German economy shrunk by 0.2% in the spring
The crisis around the world has slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent in comparison with the prior quarter from April to the end of June 2014.
This was done by the Federal Statistical Office, which confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone animated the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Trade in trade has also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual performance, a total of 0.8 percent of GDP will be achieved in the first six months of the year compared with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland Mooiste," which for the first time led through the town of Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
On Sunday, the Burgmannstadt town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenriders." 
The largest cycling club in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Moolist." 
This is the biggest bicycle tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants were thanked with their registration with Jos ter Huerne for the organisation of this tour by the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various trade journals.
We come from Den Helder and are driven by night to take part in this tour.
We would like to take a closer look at this kind of Münsterland.
After registration in the club sheim of the Sta.
Katharina went to a small "peace" drive through the city over the Wall where it was also launched.
Further, the route, which was advertised for three different categories, led to Herrenholz to Coesfeld and Havixbeck and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck to Horstmar.
On routes from 95 kilometers with 1175 elevation of altitude to 120 kilometres with 1475 height metres and 145 kilometres at the height of 1775, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were sold en route to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer of Jos, and the mayor of Heinz Lölfing, was delighted with the success of this cycling event.
We are happy and it was a great experience for all of us.
The organisation ran without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing began a positive result of this event.
Unfortunately, not so many people came as the organizer had hoped was probably the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
"In 2015, we look back on the weather on 30 August or another weekend, but cyclists promised to come back to the Münsterland, and the organisers are planning a new edition.
Constantine wake up honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony as biography, which has brought Constantine Wecker, Songmacher, pacifist, polit-safe activist, ex-detainee, to 287 pages on paper.
On 1 June 1947, his memoirs of Munich were written on 1 June 1947, and each chapter was initiated by a suitable song of song.
And he is ruthless in this: From the Onanie to the high school to shoplifting and drug use, he does not have a human weakness.
Also to show how he has learned his own tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also take abstract but the more important terms one: Love, soul, ego, the existence in the now, spirituality - all this tries to go to the cause, to very philosophical, but also in a very personal manner.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political engagement, and also his music: Opera lovers became a soul and a rock musician, but also his stay in prison.
The latter also brought the ginger, Konstantin Wecker, closer to the ascetic monk who is created by subtraction, as he says.
There are also short anecdotes about the earth between all of the highly spiritual views: For example, about beatings in a pub frequented by GIs or a crazy drive in which he has targeted a tree at the front.
Here, too, it is ruthless to be honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never left me in the arm.
Has never said "I love you" 
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tested for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father, being created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through a number of difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry thought about his relationship with his father.
It was difficult to know it.
Never saw his face, he only heard his voice.
Leave your sister in peace.
Walk away!
I want to see cricket.
My elderly brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who had already grown up when I was a child, went with him to the pub and spoke about things like the shape of the beer or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It is slightly lighter now, but they are dark, rough, deep stygic labyrinths with flaming and smoke and a lot of rain.
My father simply put himself into the tub, and then it was possible to hear it slowly how he began to sing because he was able to wash the foundry.
When I was running around it there I realised that he had done it for years to put the meal on the table, and that my respect for him was greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew as a child without love of love to his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you." 
Only when my mother towards the end of her life went ill, we began, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
With his own daughter, Billie, he was able to share the love he had been missing as a child.
Could you stop with "I love you" to stop?
Ask me to change my mind!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mother.
It is still with French that he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good human being.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mother.
Henrys's own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to their death.
So, when I was very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "You must be radical.
So I moved to this fitness and I also had to make a drastic diet in order to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is demanding.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henrys's career in career change may be seen in his elegant and short cut bar.
Since he was praised by the critics of his Othello, he is captured by the theatre.
It was followed by the comedy of the mishaps, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is another of the experiences as Sitcoms and comedies that have filled his business with life.
He began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered it on stage when he imitated people, and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies, "I was for a pretty long time the only black imitation/comedian on television." 
He learned at work.
I needed to learn not only from public opinion but also from 1975 to 1985, and I was able to become an efficient w narrative machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 with New Faces
As his manager owned stage law at Black and White Minstrel Show, a light program in which people "painted black," Henry introduced his comedy there for five years.
The room was clean, the room was clean and the bathroom was clean.
I somehow wish that it would never have happened, but I do not regret that I have done it.
It was a curious, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-on-year light pillar of British television" was also a" grotesque parody of black people.''
With the introduction of figures who celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative community in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Chef.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film rolls were the next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008 he thought: "What you are doing next, Len, because it feels like it feels like it is the time of time, take a little in front of it." 
After that, a documentary series for Radio 4 was released with the title What's So Great About?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was really allergic.
I never learned anything about him at school, and mostly I thought it was for a domain of middle class, whites in tights and a coal head in the front.
So I have a great deal of fear of it.
All that we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it again.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few of the words in his mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare.
Henry ran 20 lines from Othellos's final speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I had the feeling that I was able to do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
"That is what it is, it is a serious thing to take them seriously, to investigate your text, researched a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car crash, and this was simply not possible.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the verses.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought "you have changed." 
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me" I have to bridge 10 minutes while they repair the computer." 
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem has been solved.
I went from the stage, and something in me said, "Oh, thank God." 
I am not responsible for this.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stick in your role." 
Henry in Fences on the Duchess Theatre
To learn the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
That also came well, so it is like a big sign of the gods who tell me.
He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.
So I stand by it.
I really love this.
I love to be in a sample room.
However, Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is steeped in humorous outbursts while he imitates people over and over again.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of instant satisfaction of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you look for it forever, you move to a wall.
I sometimes compete in the Apollo if I want to, but I don't have much as I used to.
I ask him if he is ever going to make a stand-up comedy.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning, a middle section and the end of a trip - I do not think I want to give up again.
Does this mean that it is its new incarnation?
I think so.
I would like to have an actor.
It is fun to do.
One always tells a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels are blocking roads in Yemen's capital.
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis has called into civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi-followers would have occupied on Monday the central roads in Sanaa, saying a spokesman of the Huth party "Ansar Allah." 
We have also blocked access to Parliament.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online issue of the newspaper "Yemen Post," Huthi-leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for action on Sunday evening.
According to the leaf, Huthi threatened with a further escalation of the conflict if its demands were not met.
The Shia Huthis are fighting for more independence from the Sunni, and are demanding that the government resign.
The Huthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access routes to Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, bloody battles with the Yemeni army continue to occur.
Kenya Registered Public Employers to Protect Employers of Hearers
Kenya has begun to register all state officials with biometric in order to wipe "ghost workers" from government pay lists.
People who do not register for the next two weeks would no longer be paid was a statement of government.
The government is suspected that thousands of people will receive salaries even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in public service when he took office in 2013.
When an audit was carried out at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least EUR 1 million (£700,000 £-RRB- per month was lost to payments for "ghost workers" and to other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be paid out to accounts after a person died or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear in the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data on biometric registrations is notified in a message of government.
Anyone who would not have done so without a credible apology from the pay list continued the communication.
"This action has significantly contributed to the rationalization of public service by identifying the actual number of officials, and the pay list at both levels of government will also be eliminated - the" ghost workers" will be eliminated,'' said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of decentralisation and planning.
The scandal of the art consultant Helge Achenbach is first being negotiated in court on 11 November.
Five heirs to Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi-founder Theo Albrecht, call for compensation from Achenbach and two of his companies which are in insolvency proceedings in a civil process at Düsseldorf District 19.4.
This was one of the judges who spoke on Monday.
In the letter, Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars, and charged Berthold with higher prices than was actually paid.
This would also mean that the amount of commission would have been higher.
Achenbach purchased items of value for 121 million Euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
For 44 years he was in the service of the School, of whom 23 was the head of school.
From that time, Manfred Richter knows a lot of Peter Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a pupil.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but it is always based on his desire to see human beings at school.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves painting with the motif of his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
Already with 14 he was interested in four years of secondary school for teacher profession.
One year later the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour the family had to leave their homes.
After a few months in one camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight car.
This is how it is being taken by judges to become one of the Upper Franks.
The teaching of teachers took place in Bamberg.
In order to do this, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers to the next railway station six times per week, take the train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the whole city to school and return to the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in one of the Red Cross Homes in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 people in a dormitory.
In 1951, he made the first after three years of teaching the second state examen after three years of teaching.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free teacher for him, he prayed to Upper Bavaria and came to school in Kollbach on the 1st of November 1954.
The "Miss room" was his first" in school'' in the school building.
In 1958, he referred to a three-room apartment in the new teacher building next to the school.
This House bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year of 1968/69, they were brought together in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf School was founded, only primary school was left.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the smaller school, the then rector, Georg Sigl, moved to Karlsruhe - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, from September 1982, the children and their teachers were able to obtain the building which was extended to judge retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then Mayor, Ludwig Götz, who, in addition to building a workshop room, was built during the expansion of 1997 cellar premises, although that was not eligible for the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very debt-friendly," judge reminded himself.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a representative of government who responded to a lecture of a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget the love of people." Manfred Richter put forward what he heard as a young teacher.
"One needs to give the children two things: Roots and wings," says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: If he only means his disciples or his own six children, he is not quite clear.
In any case, judge was sometimes unconventional.
When disciples are considered, they have not been fined and have not been beaten up for the night.
At the expense of the community, judges had created two pair of boxing gloves and they were forced to compete against each other, even if there should be a fan.
For the good of the school, judge as rector established a good relationship with the then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
He at least moved to his retirement in 1996, at least as a last on the list of councils for the municipal council in 1996.
But judges won six and joined the CSU.
More than 180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists place stopovers in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scots stopovers.
If Radler makes on her tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of impressions alone was made: The 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen, and later a party under the open sky in the old town of Alteburgpark.
The participants on Thursday met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and saw a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: The Radler took the first stage, 60 km above Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, athletes were welcomed by mayors Hans-Peter Zentrum, who was co-run in Bad Vilbel with the bicycle, and the head of the in-house company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
A lot of good things have been prepared for the refreshment of your body and mind: The women from the town and the town of Nieder-Mockstadt have baked 85 sheets of apple, banana, litter and cheese cake.
"These kind of cakes can only bake in rural women," a participant from Aulendiebach praised.
Cold refreshments were used at the drinks booth of the Turnclub hostage.
The duo was delighted to announce the release of famous melodies from operettas and musicals.
The beautiful ambience of the park has been relaxing.
A gentleman also had a head massage from his partner: "he deserved, and finally he has already bolted up the bicycle chains that have been spun off today." 
Meanwhile, the Mayor and the manager had to work: They were interviewed at the well before the tip of reporters Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to promote the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Since the first hr4-Radtour in 2004 since the first hr4-Radtour in 2004 Tobias Hagen has been able to buy a lot of snow, but it has had plenty to do with local technology.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated via three telephones and a radio with his colleagues, communicated facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he told," also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from a number of cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends on the accommodation capacity available.
In category I will host the participants in hotels, in Category II in class accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up after one and a half hours: "Chüss!" 
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen," she came to leave.
After the arrival in Scots the group was allowed to pause for a short break.
However, in the evening the cyclists were required to reach the idyllic Alteburgpark park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Association for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park was given a beautiful festive atmosphere and of course it was prepared to prepare delicacies, such as flamboyants with well cooled spring whites.
The mayor, Susanne Schaab, GTS-CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sach in his role as the director of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scots." 
DJ Tobias Hagen then gave the dance stage free.
The occasion to enjoy a lively climate under open sky has been eagerly used in spite of sporting activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests, increasing numbers of people mixed with the good mood as well as the great shame of cyclists.
On the second day the stations of Birstein, Guarditersbach and Bad Orb, including a concert with the Trenkwalders, were on the program on the second day.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey on account of the suspicion of the "plot against the government," local media agencies report.
The police authorities did not make a direct comment.
Among those who were arrested, there are 14 senior police officers who report Keuriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the investigation of government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for having founded a organized criminal union and tapped telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at that time) described her actions as part of the activities that are cited by the Islamist cleric's propensity to slate against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school.
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September festivities were not held at any school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a vast common Ukrainian people front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school at Slawjansk, who visited his daughter's daughter, spoke about Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in another life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding ballons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
It meets with a proud retirement home from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Torah party.
And it has its own frontal experience.
Her career began with the global management consultancy Bain and Co., which changed her career to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of Pearsons.
She served as Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the chief post of mother company Pearsons went to a young male colleague.
It claimed it was worth almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former chairman of BP when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: She became adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory of the Council.
As early as May, I described the role of the Chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: From the first in the BBC, but also to the outside world, as a voice of public concern and unrest, if things go wrong.
This makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires full reform.
But a new leader who will face it would risk going to everything, and splitting an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might want to do his job himself.
It is a difficult task.
And, as if that is not good enough, many of them are keen to see the BBC reduced - power, money, and status.
While competition is approaching and new technologies threaten old and comfortable guarantees, the forthcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of €145.50 per year, the British public purchases the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: It says it reaches 96% of households and each costs only 40 pence per day.
And it seems that the BBC is up at the top of popularity: 53 per cent supports it, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The BBC visual and service habits have changed: I am getting news lines today on my mobile phone and I see programs later fit on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
It needs a significant chairman - I hope she has found it.
Perry of Texas says that condescending Tweet was not authorised
A Tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, contained a derogatory remark about the democratic local prosecutor, who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of the perrys user account that rejected the previous one.
A Tweet was sent from my account which was not authorized by me.
"I do not approve of the Tweet and I deleted it," it said in the later message.
Employees of Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perrys officially released their account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavourable picture of the local prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned in April 2013 for drunkenness at the wheel.
Perry put a veto on financial support for its office when it refused to resign what led to a trial against Perry - who might be a candidate for 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweets is as follows: "I am not always drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level but when I do it, I give Governor Perry when he is chilling." 
I am the most active democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry does not advocate, and has called the charge a political trick.
His high-tech team of lawyers asked in the case that, with this case, the judge in charge of detaining the prosecution argued that the law against the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas is unclear.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government funds to the State Integrity Unit of the State - which is based in Travis County, and was determined to resign when state corruption in Texas refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint on the part of a party on the left.
Perl official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After he completed his presidency in Iowa in 2012 during his presidential election in Iowa, Perry went to speculation that he would stop by turning a sound of a photograph of himself to jogging near a lake, with the words of South Carolina!" 
Berkeley declares Home Market is back for "normal" 
One of the most prominent developers in London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England has returned to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were hotter about and subject to enormous price rises as the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, was able to impose limits on mortgage lending in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and chief executive of Berkeley, Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal levels of transaction since the top of 2013," adding that this is a" stable act of action.''
The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Katowice Office, the prices in the urban area rose by 18.5 percent last year, far from the average in England and Wales as a whole.
Average sales prices at Berkeley's private, cheap and student offers increased by about one fifth last year and were £423.000 £at the end of April.
But a stronger pound has made property less attractive in London for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "private settlement" before the general elections in May.
London Real Estate Agents warned last week that in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April in which tougher lending arrangements were introduced would also lead to lower market growth for both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England of Monday show a decline in the mortgage approval of July, which also indicates that the property market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another Real Estate Agency, revised its predictions for the rise in housing prices in London to 3% in 2015, on the basis of an already weak profile of domestic prices.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has fallen by a quarter by year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the due amounts for futures amount to more than 2.2 billion £.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well planned product at the best locations has remained stable and as a result sales have remained stable." 
In June, the company reported that it sold 3.742 new homes until the end of April - almost a third higher than at the 2007 peak before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40 percent to €280 million a year, increasing by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the Annual General Meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley is likely to meet current market expectations this year.
Analysts estimate that the annual pre-tax result is £450 million.
Berkeley shares a fixed £23.96 £in the afternoon of trade in London.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence released by hackers on the internet
Jennifer Lawrence gig at the 85th Oscar award.
Naked pics of the Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were released online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master" list of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star of "The Tribute of panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were authentic and that the hacker dared to use" blatant infringement of privacy.''
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
This was the first time Apple released a new version of Apple, which is now the first to be released by Apple.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Wessel, Star of "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who take a look at the photos that my husband and I recorded years ago in the private environment of our house, I hope you are so happy with you," Written wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly and" denied that it is pictures of her and tweetete that are pictures of her and tweetete I'm so-called nude pics of me, people.
Let us defend ourselves from the beginning of the day.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly praised novel about love and the letter "J." 
They went up, so they could be described as best, and they ended slowly like a carton that was left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he is too serious, that he is demanding, intensively and intensively, and that he might be a little scratchy.
And shake hands with him.
He knew what he knew about it.
He was stachelous, as in Igel, yea.
The last victim of this frivolity was an incipient affair that was more promising for alleviating the solitary boredom of his life, and it might even have been a degree of satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling beauty with uncoated hair and a flattening heart from a village on the North Island that was still remote and harsh, and he was taken as a port.
It came with an older companion to the south who held Kevern for her aunt, and that had inherited a plot in a damp but heavenly valley with the true name of Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leck, the baths were still spiders, the necks had their traces on all the windows and they thought they were one of them, and the garden was monitored with weeds which looked like huge coal heads.
It was, like the house of a children's fairytale, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the One Man Booker Award in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had a unusually warm spring afternoon with an Ailinn and had a unusually warm spring afternoon that had a land of reassuring music and a good news than the sight of her shaved brown legs reminded him of an old track of a long forgotten black entertainer, to whom his father was happy to sit with closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Do not ban - nothing was properly forbidden - simply did not play.
It has successfully become obsolete as the word becomes obsolete.
The general taste of what people would never have done and how people choose to choose between the Vom-Teller, millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love novels was created, so they chose the ballads during the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to wear great feet in a grob-comical Serenade.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he explained it, and he automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That was what his father always done to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It began as a match between him and his father when he was small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he told him.
If you take a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was not a very funny game at that time, and it was not very funny now.
He knew he was expected to do so, and that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn has never heard any of them.
Jazz, even if it was not directly prohibited, was not played.
The improvising was no longer modern.
It was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be quite sure of a melody where it would end.
Also the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew anything about jazz from the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he did not have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Wall was black.
At age she could probably not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
A compliant society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of group talent - grateful to the fate of fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were prepared for fun and sports by temperament and body, so sang and ran them.
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed as by nature with electronic talent, and were served with the task to ensure that no family remained without a functioning service.
What was still left of the Polish community took care of the sewers; what was left of the Greeks, crushed plates.
Those from the Gulf countries and the Levante whose grandparents had not left the country quickly when WAR came to be accused of being accused of being accused of fire because of fear of being accused of fire, were afraid that the flames would consume them next - they had had laboratories and Shisha-Pipe restaurants, and they were depressed by inaction.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could ever be made more expensive.
Music was an expression of love.
"Those are not really insulting," Kevern
Other than for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended someone, but he loved this song.
He talked about too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security.
Nothing has been able to overcome the soundproofing of the enormous carbonic leaves.
Ailinn still does not understand.
Why would your father love to love it?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips in her present.
She already thought he was rather odd.
"It appeared funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head and blocked his head, which was blocked.
There was nothing more to see around the world than her naked black hair on the planet.
There was nothing he would have wished to see.
"If you say, I mean it without conviction.
But that does not yet explain why you present it to me.
They seemed to be very worried.
Are my feet too big?
He has looked again.
Your feet do not do so directly.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit of a few?
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
You hate you?
Of course I do not hate you.
That is just the silly song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early to do so.
"My thick ankles are the very reason why you like me," he tried instead.
I think I am a little disappointed.
That is not right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm that was needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be Kevern, who was.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was red and rose from their deck chair, threw the console and swallowed the wine they used to drink.
Holunality was not an apology for him, so it was not an apology for him.
In their excitation they seemed to tremble, like palm wedges in the storm.
"and your thickness is exactly why I feel drawn to you," she said.
Apart from that, I am not in favour of that.
She was sorry, both for the unnecessary inconvenience of his words and for the fear that was revealed in her eyes when she was opposed to him.
Did they think he would beat them?
It did not tell him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as it was here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke here and there on the banks of the river.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and according to DEM WHO WAR when they had been their ancestors as smugglers and liqueurs, wandering from pub to pub, were always prepared to collect the hand against a woman who refused or disappeared.
Thick head?
They would have had a big fist if they did not fit in!
Only when you knead, the most widely used word for an erotic attraction between men and women was a counter-poison to the empty love ballads from the console - they first kneel and then beat.
This was an unnecessary refinement, as this was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through her bodies.
He arose from a deck chair like an old man.
She also felt able to remain, but the tide of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They were hardly aware of this.
She saw to him how he was a man who complained about something he himself summoned, as he was from a room on top of the upper floor.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some had raised her hands against them.
A man turned from her to bow to his back, it is ashamed, it is ashamed, and without fighting spirit - why it was a sight that she seemed to know well if she couldn't remember her for a time she had ever seen before before today's day?
When she was alone, Ailinn Solomons looked on her feet.
A few years before the events that have just been reported, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative body for public mood, has been working on a short talk about continued violence on the low and medium level in precisely the areas where their reduction, if not abolition, would have been most likely to be expected in view of the funds and energy that had been invested in
"There was a lot of work to be done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote," to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who led a thousand wars, and won most of it, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the land where the sweet breath of human kindness historically has rarely been felt in spite of the high rise of
But a number of features turn out to be intractable.
The higher the church tower is, the less it seems to the passion that it continues to awaken.
When listening to sentimental ballads, the people are crying out for stories about the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless, not only the past of rural communities but also our urban fabric are firmly in their hands; there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious dispute at home, at work, on the streets, and even in the fields of play
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate, her mentor told him when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask whether you are atheists.
"I don't think I have to say," I said ESME Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, ESME was right to call their right to privacy and refusal.
Feminist?
Silence.
"I am not wondering," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbian or feminism.
This is a free job without prejudice.
We serve a society that is unbiased.
However, certain types of hypersensitivity, which are perfectly acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the way in which they have been presented.
You yourself seem to have prejudice against the Church, and these things which you call a "backply" and" roh'' could be interpreted by others as well as expressing a spirit of strength and vitality.
If you continue on what is going to happen, WHAT IS, IF I do, as if it had happened yesterday, it would mean that if it had happened yesterday, it would lead to the essential vitality of the country.
ESME Nussbaum looked at it while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED label in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow gave to the country in the last quarter-century of a century or longer.
Smile your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, speak, explain, you say you agree, vote, excuse yourself.
Speaking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to go," ESME Nussbaum responded with a calm voice when she was certain that her former had spoken to the end, and I say nothing other than that we are not yet as effective as deceiving ourselves.
I am concerned that without a warning, we might find ourselves in the process of seeing how we repeat the mistakes that have only been made to DEM WHAT will happen.
But this time it is not the others where we leave our rage and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed with the hands of a pyramid.
To indicate a patient's patience.
"They go too far, he said," if you call acts as a "mistake" which our grandparents might have committed.
They also go too far when they talk about leaving their "rage" and their" suspicion'' of "others." 
It should not, in fact, be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past, as in protecting the present, we are not talking about `us' and` others'.
There was no "we" and there was no" other''.
It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.
"When we are honest with ourselves," when ESME dared throw, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I do not appeal to anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well what has happened has been done.
That was then.
Nothing needs to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no blame needs to be apportioned, there is no need to be blamed if such a eradication is proportionate and if there is a way to wipe it.
But what is the point of the past if we do not learn from it?
The past serves to make us forget them.
If I can say something about this -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said, leaving her.
On the next day when they went to work as usual, she was driven by a motorcycle driver who, like passers-by, was in a kind of "brutal anger" on the foot of the foot.
There are seizures.
Lesotho-military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Officials of the military fought in Lesotho to have planned a coup to overthrow the government, and said they were opposed to policemen who are accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country, sharing that the country's army occupied his home residence and that he occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting threats of attack.
Military spokeswoman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no coup in reality, but that the military is on the threat of "political fanatics" whose armament is in the hands of the police.
"What happened this morning was that the Department of Defense Forces of Lesotho acted after he received several intelligence reports that, within the police, some elements that actually wanted to wreak havoc on some of the political, party political fanatics that were on the verge of wreaking havoc, he said to Voice of America.
Clayson Monyela, the leader of South Africa, has said that military action has created the impression of a regiment.
"Even though no one has claimed that the government is torn by violence, all the reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces have shown signs of a coup," he said.
Spokesman of the military of Lesotho informed on Sunday that the soldiers would fall back into their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, the Deputy Mothetjoya is taking over governance during the absence of Thabanes.
Thabane told us that he believed that he was targeted because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, since June, there has been a great deal of tension following the arrest of Thabane's parliamentary meetings, owing to the confrontations in its unity government.
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government, despite accusations that were different.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in output in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point of the last 13 months in August, with a closely observed study.
The final Markit acquisition index of manufacturing (PMI) fell in August to 50.7, according to a stand of 51.8 in July.
There is an expansion of more than 50 countries.
New contracts went back, and factories experienced breakdowns at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures are taking place before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect a clear plan from the Bank for dealing with a sluggish recovery of the eurozone, and for the threat of deflation at a rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the chief of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information this week whether it is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those that were carried out by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers has become clearer," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, the second-largest economic nation of the bloc, France, fell to 46.9.
France remains a sort of child, as well as Italy's descent from a solid expansion to stagnation.
References to the fact that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer effective, nor that they are reassuring are also not reassuring, as Mr Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland where PMI rose to 57.3, to the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said, "The best that can be said for the manufacturing manager index of manufacturing in the euro area in August is that the sector will continue to grow." 
As he added, "Producers in the euro area are now obviously quite difficult to find, as current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainty in the increasingly difficult conditions that continue to grow in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, particularly, and the confidence of consumers, and it is likely that a number of contracts will be delayed or even cancelled, in particular large contracts.
He said that it would be "increasingly likely" that the ECB should launch a kind of QE," though we suspect that will be limited.''
For ten years, ten years have passed since the terrible siege of school. This is how the children involved in it are still suffering.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people of Chechen militias were taken hostage in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who have escaped with the death of Greueltat in the classroom.
A decade after the appalling siege of Beslan, when 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East in disgust, and, surprisingly, turned surprisingly in the midst of the worst misery in action and in hope for the future.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped with the death of Greueltat in the classroom.
We have found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will be traced forever.
Their greatest hope?
The fact is that the war which is now home to Ukraine and which is dying of children like them is now coming to an end.
The girl who has been photographed during the attempt to climb back into the closed school sports hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and is famous when she tried only in her underwear to climb back into the closed school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused by her mother, Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
They were believed to be dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me I was going to race for my life, but I could not say," Aida said then.
My legs have been anemic.
I stood up and climbed again to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but he said yesterday that "three months ago, the pain returned.
I am afraid I have to take action again.
Some grenades are still in my knees.
Their goal is to become a dentist in order to help people who have been helped by their doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not break me," she says.
"That is what happened to me, and that can not be changed
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on another day.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and we dreamed of going to school.
"I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
To a family I think later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, although the memory of each year will become somewhat weak.
I am pleased that many people in the world remember our horrors, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online as I go back to school, I think that a lot of people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and help to ensure that this does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball miner thinks that his mother is dead.
It was his first school day (Russians go to school for 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said: "Mama told me I should lay down when there is an explosion, and hold its hand." 
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: "Run." 
Full of fear that she could be dead, he fled, and saw on the way a little child, seized it by hand, and fled through a ball miner.
His father, Vladimir, who left his son in the arms, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I could not save them." 
In reality, Tamara was cut off from outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn in the assumption that her son died.
After reunification, she said, "I wept for joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from what is now The News of the World) in order to win the title of a Barnardo Children's Champion by the former Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it becomes pale in my memory.
I still know that I dropped all my toy guns immediately.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I do not think of myself.
I remember these children, with whom I played in the courtyard, and they did not manage it outside.
We never say they have been killed or are dead.
We say they have stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well on my trip to London, especially to the toy shop, where I was able to pick everything I wanted, and the trip is in an open car at the top.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered.
This horror is persecuting you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from Greucleas, Damir worked as a volunteer last week.
I would like to help.
One day, I want to go to the police, and I hope they will take me to the Academy of Education next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed you can imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and run around, and this silence lasted many months.
It vividly reminds you of her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London wept when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting you and her husband remember in London, and like the Damir and me helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borashsch and call all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant.
And that was only one month after horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, `I always think this world has not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war now goes on, and every day people die and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just those children like ours.
I think many of the war are part of the news they hear when they are bored or occupied.
I simply know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can not stop feeling it
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir has been big and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the last greules.
I know he does not like to be reminded of it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light the candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa, the face of us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember how he continued to continue his weapons and other military toys.
I can't believe that for a few hours I have been so sure he is dead and that I would never see it again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to his legs, I saw myself, and I saw the hell around me, with the body parts that surround me.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in that hell could possibly have survived.
"I remember I was calling him, Damir, Run, Run Trail, but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17
The Young, whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the atrocities of Beslan
Consolation: The occupied Georgiy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004 is on the right of a picture of Georgiy today.
His bloodied face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarity.
His mother, Fatima, 54, had dismissed him for his first day of school before she rushed to bring her older son, Vladimir, to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three horrible days alone," she remembers.
Not entirely alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgiy managed to survive.
The closer this date approaches, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think it is long ago, I think it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days follow forever.
No one will forget that, I promise you.
Strong: The image of Georgiy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgiy was happy to go to school on that day; he said he wanted to change his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the wine-producing Georgiy in San Marino.
Georgiy does not like the picture, and it is hidden among us at home in the bookcase.
I understand this, but I also think that the people of all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgiy is saying today: "It is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies over and over again and never experience the truth.
And now they investigate the crash of these Boeing in Ukraine.
Are we ever going to know what caused it?
This world is becoming more terrible.
"I can not understand how this is possible, because if you ask people to ask, nobody wants a war, as happens
Ten years is nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little.
It attacked my health and I still feel.
For about three or four years I had a couple of nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
I went back to school in 2004 and was afraid of every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That is why I always go to the sports hall when 1 September is approaching.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It is hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I do not feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I am not going to forget it, but I do not.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I will be a heartbeat.
My first election was education in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health failed to do so.
I wanted to fight for my country, but this will not happen.
Georgiy Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived, although he was caught on the heels of a murderous terrorist.
A miracle: Georgiy fanatics were captured during the siege on the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and was sitting next to the bomb that was fixed at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is a wonder that he was not killed.
"We feel as if it was yesterday," says Georgiy, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but was unable to do so because of his health damage as a result of the siege.
It is still with me that it is nothing I have left behind me.
I am older and people tell people that children can easily deal with terrible experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - in the year - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return, so please do not ask me to show you where I have read in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgiy Faniev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I don't like to think about or talk about it, and they never asked me about the school.
Physically it is good for me to do.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can now walk well.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in St Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have submitted my documents, I have also sent my documents and they have responded that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have already spent two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows." 
He said, "I knew I would never report my experiences to my children.
Children should not know about this, and they should not, of course, suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary is approaching.
I shall go to the commemoration.
I know that Georgiy will not go.
It has to be much stronger for him because he was there and I was not.
I waited at home to him and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me; all of them are drawn in Beslan.
It remains in us.
Georgiy is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.
It is difficult to accept that if something is so unfair.
He is a boy, he likes sport, but he can not attend because of his knee.
It has been operated on a number of occasions, it can run, but it can not exercise sport
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50%, but we can never completely overcome that and forget.
This terrible experience will always be followed by us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege, and this only strengthened my pain.
I lost many people whom I knew well and which were expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make to me, but my heart is crying for the people.
I know about families where new children were born, but also widows who never married.
It is hard to accept that life is continuing, even if we do not want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped to me when I saw him in hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I almost can not believe
We used to be a friendly country, so we can fight for it.
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and are still being killed.
If we can only grab and throw all these rebels go as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was so taken by a special force in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is released by a Russian Special Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world breathed into breath in 2004 when Baby Aljona was born into the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists left them, but in their cruelty they held their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar, in the school sports hall.
Makhar, at that time, was three years old, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Since then her father Ruslan has married again, and with his new wife Swetlana has a little girl that he called after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, which is ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl who has grown to say neighbours.
"You are a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save all of the memories that arise with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Accused of having girls on the foot of foot in Fife
A 78-year-old man is standing in front of court for passing a three-year girl on a footpath.
Gordon Steward is accused of having a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charge applies, Mr. Steward has steered his Audi Q3 without due care and attention, and the girl is injured.
Stewart, 78, was from Anstruther, arguing against the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC contacted the January procedure for January.
4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most expensive option is a water-proof point of point And-Shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action-Cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver edition, both of which are worth about $300.
I have taken up these photos with a family of several cameras that are all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment there are a few rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other subjects are closed.
Also put your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
A couple of cameras and camcorders have scenes and recording pieces with which the exposure time for the underwater conditions is optimized.
And before you jump into it, check the depth of your equipment.

Make multiple shots - because many will not fold.
Point-and-slot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, Action-Cams normally do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water and the right picture is a matter of luck.
So you are taking a lot of pictures.
If your camera has a string mode that makes a series of shots with easily changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will deteriorate dramatically as you move away from the surface.
If possible, so stay close to the surface when you make pictures in a pool, lake or the sea.
This makes it possible to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less the color will see.
Take a closer look at the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is even more important under water because of poor light conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an Action-Cam: These devices often have a fixed angle of wide angle, which means that you need to be able to take a closer look at your objects if they are to complete the entire image wire.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in a gigantic organisation like NHS.
As an advisory, he devoted his career to the task of saving patients both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and diseases, while the treated mostly work with something quite different: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose suffering began.
"I did not feel," he wrote in May this year.
I have had difficulties to catch up.
While he was fighting with the grim symptoms, he noticed that he impatiently accused him of his wife.
"I prefer everything as soon as possible," he listed.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and completely worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago, he had been to skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray inspection was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that causes the breast skin, which attacks the lungs.
As with most cancers, the precise trigger is usually difficult to control.
While, for example, some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancers have been smokers in the past.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos strain - contact with the fibre construction, which was once known as the "miracle" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us Mesotheliom is a disease that can easily ignore.
Finally, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960" s, when industry voluntarily committed itself to use it no longer.
Where he was still used, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous material from another time, it seems unlikely to be worrying today.
But there is no room for complacency.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the culmination of a mesolean epidemic.
There are more deaths from Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people this disease die than in road accidents.
Annual Numbers of Mesotheliomes since 1980 and prospective future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are now experiencing the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999, all types of asbestos have been banned in 1999), a mesotheliom is only developed after decades.
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not confined to former building workers.
Asbestos was, and is often still, in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops where we shop.
This is why Mesotheliom does not know any class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protected area.
The parliamentary buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
The hospitals where we are supposed to become healthy have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber either.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks as if in the tunnels of Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years, there was a lot of asbestos.
All students, nurses, doctors and Pförtner use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he has been able to answer this question at least in part.
"From the four doctors who were educated at Guy's Hospital, which has been infected with Mesotheliom during the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010," I'm the last who still lives.''
How many of us will become ill?
With Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55th.
This was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty per cent of all trade fairs die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease is always lethal.
We can therefore only repeat Mr Lawson's question as to how many of us will become ill.
Britain's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the epidemic of asbestos epidemic in Great Britain is expected to come to a halt, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be lost.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die.

A short look at the files of courts, in which those affected often turn for compensation, shows the extent to which the scourge of the Mesothelioms is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer gave, for example, to have been exposed to asbestos by Janice Allen by accident.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothes department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years ago when she began her work at M & S
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this matter," I have never heard of Mesotheliom, "I have never heard of Mesotheliom, I did not really know anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the concept of asbestos does not relate to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name stems from the word `asstform ', a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most widely used asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof tiles, for flooring, for pipe insulation, for pipe insulation, and even for brake linings in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is seen as "great health risk" of the EU and the WTO, with possible death.
However, dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's biggest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is a strong but indirect indication that this was a key reason for uniquely high trade fairs." 
A staff of Marks & Spencer was located in the flagship store of Oxford Street, London, and asbestos exposed to Alamy
Janice Allen might not have seen himself as a typical victim of trade, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
It has presented a study of those affected which shows that `a significant proportion of Mesothelioma without known suspension was caused by asbestos contact in the environment through asbestos contact
Most of these contacts are based on what he said about the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It seems that no one can expect to be certain.
A report by Goddard Consulting, who has studied the Palace of Westminster, shows how people also could have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service powers and pipelines behind Parliament's committee of asbestos were contaminated by asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be ripped up by something as harmless as "strong air movement." 
MEPs are frequently accused of caring for their own interests, but it seems that the opposite is true.
While the directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Western Minster Palace should have obtained a "clean health certificate," it is now indisputable that one billion £has been raised over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernize electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, Members of Parliament will meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green benches at Westminster
The Goddard report also pointed out that `the presence of asbestos was not handled according to the relevant provisions
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
Everything we can do is wait.
One person who has never been able to determine accurately the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos cases were positively chosen," he says," but I can not prove it in my case
It is so difficult to remember all the places we have worked on and the data.
What he just remembers is the day of the beginning of December 2009, when he got a kind of fever.
He was 45, and carried out an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came quite suddenly.
I felt horrible.
I thought it would be better to go home.
As a doctor, he knew that the pain of the niece, the skin came around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He was not going to work a month.
Doctors who were surprised took the x-ray shots of his breast and began to use Pleurakathether to inspect the liquid from the lungs and test it in the lab.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his work.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned back, often after physical exercise and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient arrived with similar symptoms in his clinic and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But also now combined Abbott with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades old and worked directly with asbestos.
The link in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's state deteriorated, and his family doctor brought in his CT-Sscans and X-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a probe fitted with a camera was inserted into the cave between the ribs and thorns.
I am an optimist.
I usually simply carry on," he says.
To be honest, I have not had so many concerns.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was Mesotheliom." 
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan-nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now does it define the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings will now become ill.
This is how Mesotheliom meets younger people who have not worked in the traditional professions.
The most dangerous pipes in hospital hospitals were beneath the earth, so patients were probably rather not exposed to the fabric.
But many employees who changed from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), came into contact with the poisonous substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals have probably been life-saving for patients, but they are life-threatening for the doctors who are treating them.
It is still removed today.
Students put off their petals on asbestos mats.
And it does not just concern hospitals.
Asbestos was used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its fabulous isolation and flame-retardant properties.
Also schools in schools.
In fact, many people have had the first exposure to asbestos in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemicals, students have switched their petals on asbestos mats.
On web pages, the issue of asbestos in schools is frequently mentioned now.
Meanwhile, so many innocent objects are contained in our houses such as floors of flooring or flat panels by default.
"It is an industrial organisation that includes large parts of our real estate," commented Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to a woman concerned was the demolition of a horsemary in the 1970s.
So you can adjust how to tear away your garden scales.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went to work again, but I realized that I was not able to focus on what I did.
I have been in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I am not going to see another Christmas.
The greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was with all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to take it in," he says.
"I asked my doctor" how long do I have?" 
And I gave me about 12 months.
I remember I thought "I will not see another Christmas.
That is where it was." 
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious because our maintenance mechanism - the breathing itself - is that deadly cancer causes.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is the smallest fibre.
If the asbestos is thrown up and the fibres inhaled, they can become in the nib, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the nib and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arose with the inhaled ionized asbestos fibres," Professor Tom Treasure, a heart and thorax doctor," moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital where Andrew Lawson suspects that he has been exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital.
When asthma reaches the lung tissue, Treasure says it is pressed from the breath to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the outset.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well in Mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotter.
Some think it is worth an effort.
Treasure denies this.
"It is not possible to cut the breast," he says.
They do not come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, cancer does not speak very well in chemotherapy, but it does not heal.
"There are sometimes long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But in the end they die all.
Fortunately, some patients are actually living longer, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After he contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott was in contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and advisory office.
"Hello, cancer centre," he imagined cheerfully when he was calling.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis for four years and has still been very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles which would take four months.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to make things appear in a more positive light." 
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart and thorax specialist in Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to be moved on, I simply called on and got an appointment," " Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for approval of treatment.
Money is crucial to Mesotheliom sufferers in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments inevitably fail, many people face another financial concern - the future of the families that leave them.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here, companies" negligence began to play a role.
After all, Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital did, but it was not what Morgan calls "full compensation," because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom was due to an ascension with Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected basement were removed in the 1990" s.
This was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed, how can asbestos be removed?
In fact, it is a huge problem for Mesotheliom sufferers, who are seeking redress, to associate deadly detention of a company or a job, usually for decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there has been clear new legislation this year which makes it easier for Mesotheliom to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a fund of $350 million supported by the insurance industry for all of the funds recovered after July 2012, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiff will receive 80 percent of what a court might have been able to talk to them in a normal compensation process - approximately 120,000 £.
Some 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Like so many fields of trade, Andrew Morgan thinks that £350 million was a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and it suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time had not been passed and Mesotheliom sufferers could find companies and normally sell them.
Mike Penning, the Minister for Labour, also admitted that the law is "not perfect." 
But both Peaks like Morgan, said it was necessary to take swift action every day in the face of seven deaths.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of last year's Mesotheliom Law.
At that time Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation which he expected to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This has been accompanied by radiation therapy and a chemotherapy - a triple therapy that can present a survival rate for more than five years of up to 40 percent with the long-term survival rate.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This is, of course, with the most important thing," says Abbott.
This is always the case with patients.
There is something that can be continued.
If you open, you get worse very soon.
Graham Abbott fell to the surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancers around my chest.
I have just been 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is vital.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no trace of tumors.
But the process is very demanding both physically and mentally.
You have to think of practical things - about the money when I am no longer, for example, or my wife will show how the boom time works.
If you receive bad news, you become negative.
They must look forward.
As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents, that is hard," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much is going to be said.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I would have a disease with which I would not be old.
They responded quite differently.
Tamsin is very convivial and impenetrable.
They told it to their friends and we soon got very many calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She did not say a great deal.
Such talks are something that must permeate all cancer patients.
But such talks are not crossed by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (like Stephen Jay Gould in the end) is a grim-security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong the right of government," protesters sweeten retaliation.
On Sunday, despite the increase in calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament chose to oppose the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate.
This is probably the case for the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activist activists die plans and mobilization within a couple of hours of government.
As a matter of principle, the decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the communist leaders to reject all candidates that are not pective.
"It does not come unexpectedly, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, leader of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing promised.
It lied to the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
It is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public appointments to the Hong Kong elections would be chaotic.
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing promised to let its inhabitants choose the seat of government from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong a right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that China's leaders remain firmly entrenched in the process of a nominating committee, which is closely controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love with Hong Kong" are to be admitted.
The decision follows a summer when some of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong have taken place in many years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central movement with Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to expel the financial district if Beijing does not permit real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of announcing hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters gathered before Hong Kong's government headquarters in the rain.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience, and that they planned in weeks of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make any further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers informed the organisers that the movement "the occupation of the district was only considered last resort, that action should take place only if all chances of dialogue are exhausted, and that there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that all of the opportunities for dialogue today have been exhausted and that the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security measures, including police forces and barricades, were introduced on Sunday in front of the government building.
The unrest is exacerbated by the sense of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of mainland people reinforces competition for products and services.
Moreover, fear that Hong Kong's values, like democracy and freedom of speech, will crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy-Central-movement demonstrations as they threaten business operations - the life of Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about might cause great economic harm, depending on how many they are involved and for how long they are going," Regine Ip, who has been criticized for it, has been critical of the movement for a long time.
We do not want to fuel any fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media recently reported about the pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong as a subversive agent controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists have an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which one million people have attended - more than one-fifth of the electorate in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the biggest democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school leavers in the USA is now transferred to the universities where freshmen are offered with the private aircraft.
We look forward to responding to this request and offering Britain's first luxury travel service to students of today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transportation services such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also admitted that the service has saved a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative to students who would otherwise have to pay their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that new bookings are not yet available, since the service was just introduced, but that "students would book the service within the next few weeks.
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of €9000 a year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today differ from their expectations, and demands of students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF it is possible to do just that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as being taken.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of NUS for higher education said: "This offer seems to be completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who begin their studies this month are faced with a crisis of cost of living, as the available financial aid in form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with sharply rising bills for the simplest lives of life before they can think of spending thousands of pounds on the arrival at the student residence.
Feminists criticise race and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants raised their hands into the air and sang, "hands high, not shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protest in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators place gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
But, while tensions in the Middle East rose and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that white women's responses turned to 100% of the race.
In comparison with the answers given by black women shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays with titles like "Think about Ferguson by a white woman" and" feminism is not only about the oppression of women'' came relatively late.
But this is an important change for Perez.
"I do not think there are a lot of people in feminism who speak about the white, and privileges speak at such a high standard that they say.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves, and the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they must express this.
For English professor of Coritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light the light on which black American women are exposed every day, although they are not seen as "women's in the cultural sphere." 
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner, and get 150 leagues from everywhere," said Mitchell.
When I talk about how Fares in their own country are under siege, the silence is stunning.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who studied race, sex, and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of keeping issues clean; they live each day in combined reality.
While white women now combine racial and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that its predecessors did the opposite.
"between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were stranded and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the murder murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women's vote like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the nineteenth century, and found that the fight for the right to vote could only have been successful for one group each: Women or black people.
"They took the decision to stand up for the right of women, and the right of choice for black people should come later," said Hattery.
If you are reminded of such things, you will be able to understand why coloured women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to fight against the lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group arose almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "Fangen" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"It would not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to bring a child so seriously as they do with the right to contraception," Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation who built their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means try to understand what that means.
The well known white feminist activist Gloria Steiner took two weeks after shooting Michael Brown on facebook, and published a succinct article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian's columnist, in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger that is inherent in the body, and opinions on race, which are quite different in public opinion polls, wrote Stone.
Although Stone stands for a rather inter-sectarian feminism in which race and gender issues are addressed, some of their comments on the issue of race in America are perplexed.
Christina Sommer, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and the author of "Who stole Feminism" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men who are more vulnerable than their sisters, stand in contrast to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently introduced a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there have been annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Stone.
The relationship of police to the black community is not the only problem that is pressing for mainstream feminism.
With the US Border Police taking up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's southwest limit this year, the issue of reform of immigration also comes to the surface - this time as a woman's issue.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chairman of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that if the issue were to be reconsidered, it was merely to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
If the vast majority of men work as male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate in the women's organisations," they said.
"pig house" in Ipswich is for sale.
The image of a house for sale was removed from property owners as it became clear that it showed a great pig that had made itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is available for £120 000.
One of the details was one of the pictures of the house of the house - including a pig that had put his head on a sofa.
Real estate brokers Connells said that the pig on the photo is the owner of the owner.
"The photo was incorrectly released and now it has been removed," a speaker said.
In the exposé of the house, Connell described the earlier gathering as a "unique one-family house with one bedroom." 
Although the broker has removed the image from the web page, it still appears on advertising material.
Domestic sales were in the interest of the social media than some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SWCITY Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lottowin.
A lotto player from Harvey is this month
The search for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth will take place, with a happy winner who receives nearly $1.1 million from lottery education on Saturday.
For the second time in five years, a newsstand in Harvey drew the jackpot in the draw of the first division, after 1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner is yet to report.
The shopkeeper Steve Forward said the profit of talking is in the small town in the south-west of Perth.
The city talks of nothing, and everyone is rather excited.
We thought that could happen.
Eight WA-winners celebrated profits last month in the first division, a closing for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a married couple from Belmont reached $7.5 million a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and he said they could take advantage of the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the world this year, with a total of nearly 85 million.
What Leonidas has asked for in the gladiatorial arena
Not only the gladiators stood in Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday, defying the rain and the cold cold and enthralled by the historic spectacle.
There have been a colourful series of representations, performances, games, exhibitions, and information about the Romans and their importance to the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Moroccan fighters of Amor Mortis, who took advantage of each rainbreak to demonstrate their robust campaign art in the arena which was prepared with soft sand.
Gladiatorial owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presentation, and sent his men into the ring to become the heroic match in various gladiatorial bands.
First of all, the `provocators' were on the right arm with the right hand side with the right hand side with the right hand side and the leg on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short shell, and iron gladiator helmet, bass and armguard.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiro arius," which joined the" Secutor'' against the "Secutor" and recently fought the Burmese against the" Secutor.''
This is where the heavy metal got to each other, the shields drifted and the flying flowed through the arena that a fear and tie could become the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis," the muscular referee, has always been attentive.
"We wanted to revive the everyday life of Rome and the culture of the Roman era," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the Association of Friends of the Roman Canal, the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation time, the theme park became an "Oppidum Romanum," a Roman city, a Roman town like the father of Claus Wehage.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and the numerous buildings we still admire.
Remains of these were also seen on the Roman day of the Roman Empire, for example of the "aqueduct marble" of the 11-metre-long Roman Channel Bridge, which once stood at the ventilation elberg.
The Frontinus-Society once and now faced water and energy supplies, and business leader Petra Fricke knew: "We are still taking advantage of the knowledge of that time." 
This was also confirmed by Ralph Heiliger, Ralph Heiliger of the engineering team two from Rheinbach, who presented measurement instruments of the Romans like Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of excavations from the excavations in 1894 as well as from bricks from the original hypothet, the hot air of the sun, which once covered the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints that had been left by wolf and fox two years ago in the footprints of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the National Association excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Rhine in Rheinbach.
One found the walls of an economic building with a dart to dry cereals and mourn.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural commodity, the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A series of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass of glass, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ existed, until in the case of the Germanic people in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser is suspected.
With her, the children also worked with the Roman windmill, similar to that of today's coal mine, or wrote how the Roman disciples once called their names with metal handles on wax boards.
At the stand of the Roman Baths Zülpich the children were allowed to place mosaics themselves at the stand of the Rheinbach glass museum and at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim there was a heavy duty mill made of stone in order to grind the flour for a bread or a muesli.
With two cold blossoms drawing to date when they were faithfully prepared by the Romans, the visitors passed through the amusement park, also passing by the impressive level of the urban high school, which presented the results of their "Römer-projectwochen." 
With a Roman week from 13th to 21st September, the town of Wachtberg will also bring in a Roman year, which is scheduled for the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and historical associations as well as the Wachtberger Hiking Association, the Association Club and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a presentation, cooking evenings, and guided tours for school classes are available, reminding us of the Roman history of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary of his work will be told by his work on the nearby Wachtberg, plants as living monuments from the Roman era, and a funny lesson in the cause of international understanding, between a group of Wachtberger and the Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme within the framework of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often visible at first glance, can be explored again.
In the Wachtberger City Hall, a small presentation of the discovery of the Bercuman Matronenheiligalism will be remembered in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is straining West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies distance from each other.
The devastating Ebola outbreak is a major blow to West Africa's economy.
The crops are rotated in fields, mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has found it hard to place it in the region.
A number of international companies also distance themselves from each other.
"The Ebola outbreak is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic," is the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia's the hardest hit.
"It is a complete catastrophe, we lose very much money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sold on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia clothes.
What happens to the market is who wants to buy food or who wants to buy against Ebola.
Liberia is hit hardest by the virus, and more than 600 people are the victim of the fever.
Recently, the health authorities recently announced that the disease has penetrated into every corner of the country.
The virus has spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
More than 1500 people have already died, and thousands of others have arrived.
Foreign companies are withdrawing employees
Everywhere in resource-rich countries, companies are making use of their operations.
Foreign companies like Arcelor Mittal are leaving their employees and several international airlines are no longer flying.
Local merchants and farmers also react: Few merchants are still leaving their home in order to supply supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia that are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans, which are important to exports, are being scrapped.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for harvest.
There is no Food in Food
"People will travel ever less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.
The man for example, who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables, would prefer to stay at home.
The population is therefore getting the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: Food will be scarce.
On the markets, stocks of basic foodstuffs like rice are disappearing.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international firms, threatens an image with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time to come, says Philippe Hugon from the French think tank Iris.
It is crucial how far the virus is going to spread and how long the virus will spread.
When it comes to investors, "that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia," Hugon warns.
The disease also weighs on states that have strained national budgets.
The disease is also straining the already strained state budgets of the states involved.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily strained by the high level of spending on the health system and the addition of the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the countries involved with $60 million (45 million euros).
The consequences of this are also already in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
It is true that the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people remain out of fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced.
Celebrate its 50th Anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Berngau is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At high tours, preparations for the 50-year founding run from 12 to 14 September at Schützenverein Tannenwald.
It is planned on Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker." 
On Saturday at 6 p.m. the big fan will be shot.
After that, in the big tent of the evening there is "Stoapfälzer Spitbuam." 
The brass band makes for the music of music.
Highlights on Sunday are the feast of the festival and the day of 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the great procession at 14 o'clock.
In the afternoon there is also the price distribution of German and Gauck.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 solid dames with their Dirndln.
The band is Berngau, the brass band.
The patronage was taken by the Mayor of Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when it was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime initiated the dissolution of the society in 1937.
Only in 1964, 19 young men who founded the "Tannenwald" Berngau on 30th of April were found.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a protectorate through a difficult initial time, in which it was mainly about finding a club and installing the shooting range.
Already in the fall of 1965 the Schützenverein in the inn "Leininger" started with two teams in the lap competitions.
In the following years, the sporting goods, which have now been organized in seven teams, established themselves from all classes to the 1st grade.
For the first time in 1980, Rudi Meier has reached the magic limits of the club's purges each year, with the magical limit of 380 rings.
Just as the performance of active shooter has increased, the number of members has developed positively.
After the "Leininger" association was no longer sufficient to meet the demands of a modern protectorate, the then Executive Board, under the leadership of Johann Rinn, decided to establish a future domicile in the cellars of the new" Landgasthof Härteis.''
After a working performance of 2700 hours on 8 May, the priest of Strasser for the new protectorate gave the ecclesiastical blessings.
One of the major highlights in the history of association was certainly the 44th Gauge, connected with the solemn consecration of the new proton in July 1991.
On the 23rd and the 24th of April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary of founding.
A group of people was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl was named Böllerspeaker.
A great challenge for the "Böller" and for the club as a whole was the focus of the Bavarian Böll meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association modernized the premises and the shooting range in Berngauer Hof, bringing them up to date with the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in lap races
It is also possible to see the sporting achievements of the Schützenverein.
A total of eleven teams are currently competing in the race of lap races: Six air rifle teams, an airgun crew, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two teams of AH.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose to the league in the league of the league in 2013/14.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml rose to the Gauoberleague from the Gauliga Nord.
In addition to the shooting range there is a tradition of events such as chests, carnival and royal ball, club football and Christmas party.
With this, the protectors are also at festivals in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when he returned to the racetrack.
Tony Stewarts' return to the racetrack ended roughly half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart was going to fight against the wall for the second time when his right burst in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car to the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team manager Chad Johnston said that his 14-year-old team was disappointed, but now he will concentrate on the race of next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We go to Richmond and we hope we can do it better.
Stewart drove to a wall on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I received a good result today with good hopes for a good result," Johnston added: `It has simply failed to go.''
Shortly after the second crash, Stewarts carriage was loaded into the tractor and the team had been packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart ordered three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ash race in the north of New York.
He decided to return this week, either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond, to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his work, while an investigation into the tragic incident, which led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., appeared on the track during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities reported that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
There was still no decision as to whether Stewart will have to reckon with a charge.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12, Stewart had already entered the first 10, and was temporarily in position for four.
After a restart in round 122, ran bushs
Carriage with No. 18, out of control after the output from curve 2, collided with Stewart, with both carriages running against the wall.
Stewart continued, but dropped to 21.
Searching for Friends of Dancing
Simply try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and leader Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to their comrades.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups in the TV Jahn make it possible for secondary education to be taught in secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, a number of groups have been decimated.
Now we are going to increase the number of young people who are looking for a sport that is healthy and is a great pleasure.
In both jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, a former dancer in the jazz and Modern dance band "Spirits" are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years, six in the group of 12-15," the 20-year-old tells.
With more athletes, it would be much more fun, "it might be possible to dance quite different choreographies," she says.
If you are interested in dancing, Thursdays from 5 pm to 6 pm or on Fridays from 17 to 6.30 pm can be accompanied by the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
"The training regularly starts with a warm-up program," the trainer tells.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
Jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no predetermined shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical music to sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, conviviality is not too short.
"We are also going to eat, we watch dance films and we have also stayed in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a wonderful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
Who does not have jazz dance, it can also be accompanied by one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always take a sneak of students into the classroom on Wednesdays in the areas of kids dance, jazz dance, bamboo band, videoclip and hip-hop music.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who wants to take part in Discofox, Langmer Walzer, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can come by and take part in it.
Bulgarian Prisoners across Bulgaria
Hundreds of prisoners of prison from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest before the Court of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Even higher salaries are on a list of receivables that is to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.

NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia as a result of the Ukraine crisis as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is in line with the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
But the NATO chief accused Russia of "a gross breach of the bargain." 
"Today we need to face reality that Russia does not view NATO as a partner," he said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side suggest that they regard us as enemies.
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen also announced that he would want to increase NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that" we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary,'' Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow for New Gas Talks
According to official figures, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks on settling their gas strikes.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, when the Russian Minister of Energy said Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for a European Union decision as to whether it is also a representative of the talks.
As a result of the dispute over gas prices, Ukraine has had no more fuel from Russia for weeks.
Finally, Commissioner Oettinger, the Commissioner for Energy, has communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine warned that Russia could also interrupt supplies of gas to Europe.
Europe has about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks for power: Toll will be "very clear" .
Now the Chancellor is fully committed to doing so.
It is not, however, a licence for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU on the toll of cars has been rapidly increasing in the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken after persistent opposition from her CDU for the introduction of a toll on cars.
"To make it quite clear that it is in the treaty of coalition, and it will come," the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU leaders in Berlin.
But on a detailed model, Merkel did not find it for the time.
In the black and red government programme, `certain parameters' is mentioned.
The Federal Transport Minister, Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and work is now being done on this.
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its `no 'to a toll on all roads.
Merkel also emphasized that Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was also constructively involved in consultations on a bill.
Beyond the topic, he also spoke to Dobrindt about other means of enabling more private capital to invest in infrastructure, for example with regard to broadband.
On Sunday, Schäuble left an uncommenting on a "Spiegel" report, his house is looking into his own approach to pay to motorway investors with tolls - after the election of 2017.
As a result of this, Horst Seehofer, head of the CSU, warned that it would be possible to develop a system for drawing up tolls against the lead minister in the Brussels cabinet.
His objections confirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Agreement has never been based on holding all kinds of cycles and federal roads," said the Chairman of the Federal Republic of North Rhine-Westphalia.
In that respect, it is an important signal that hake has now announced that we should discuss the matter again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesfederations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
In the background, there are fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
As a result of the toll criticism from CDU coalitions, Seehofer was required to do so.
The left sees plans as a failure in the face of the dispute within the Union.
"The Murks-tolls are dead," said Chairman Bernd Riexinger of the" New premises'' newspaper (Monday).
"The toll failed by the minister: Dobrindt wants to introduce a sticker duty on all German roads that is going to be launched in 2016.
However, according to the Coalition Agreement, domestic car owners must not be burdened with additional charges.
Therefore, they are to receive full compensation for tolls via the motor vehicle tax.
However, the model must not penalise foreign drivers under EU law for their nationality.
Genetic disruption is often wrongly diagnosed
A bride says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK has announced that misdiagnoses are a frequent problem for people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23 000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, which can lead to an unstable course and a curved edge.
Disease is also suffering from deafness and pain; the disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she would suffer from Friedreich-Ataxie (IAs) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she would be 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew I was not able to do the same as others.
I fell constantly and everything took me longer.
I could never go with the other children rollshoe or skateboard, and often in the school I was going to walk and run.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles and stretch her feet, she saw her medical record when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from IAs.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I told nobody, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA-Company," said it.
When I was given a reply, I was shocked and got into panic.
I thought I would be 18 in a wheelchair and die with 25, and in between all my abilities would lose.
I did it alone with me and I planned my own funeral.
She said that when she became 17, she realized that her ability had not fallen so much as she had imagined, and she asked her doctor.
He stood simply on, and hugged me, and said "my love, I do not think you have that, otherwise you will already be in the wheelchair
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After a number of genetic tests, the CMT identified it.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt as if I were a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Aware Day in order to draw attention to this disease.
Lieutenant D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireman since the closure of the former force of force.
For almost ten years, the previous force in Münsingen has failed to take shots.
Nevertheless, every month of lethal ammunition is added to the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be sprayed on the ground.
A stunning bang is hallucinated by the explosions of the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen, which closed its military operation after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005.
Since that time, the 6500 hectares of grounds is the centrepiece of the Swabian Alb biosphere, which is open on 13 marked paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burdens on businessmen in the area of Washington increases with economic recovery.
Economic recovery means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax measures for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published survey took place last week, and firms in the area of Washington were no exception.
Companies in District District, Maryland, and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year of 2013, a 3.8% increase in comparison with the 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
Last year's government and local tax burden rose by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it has been the third growth year in succession after the many years of declining conclusions of 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes rose more strongly than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, so the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of District, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 per cent of its revenues come from companies.
Virginia, which accounts for 28 per cent, achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is based on a recovery in the real estate values of companies, telling researchers what led to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year with growth rates of less than 1% this year.
While much of these profits come from large states like California, New York, and Texas, it also seems to be taking place for the area of Washington.
Companies in District, Maryland, and Virginia paid out more than $10 billion in government and property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent in the course of a year.
But the apparent rebound in property values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as property taxes amount to just under one fifth of the tax authorities in companies.
Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland this is as follows: A large proportion of the real estate, especially in the tax area of D.C., is either in the ownership of the government or of non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland, for example, is forced to rely much more on income taxes in order to offer the same services that other states offer.
The recent rebound in tax revenue by companies can not be offset by the recovery of the property market
Business income also seems to recover, as do data.
Companies in the region have reported $2.3 billion of income taxes compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland generated $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest sum in the region.
While the trend is along the same lines, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
While the rise in Maryland was much higher, the rate of advancement in District District was 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax volume of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6 percent in all three areas of office, has significantly lower corporate income taxes (in all three it has fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is at 8.25 percent and in District at relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia state and local corporate taxes are demanded and there is a better fiscal climate than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not examined.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year, from 6.9% to 6%, to the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5% next year.
If the state continues to reach its income targets in the coming year, this law might reduce the state's tax rate of corporate income to 3% until 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses appear to be better off in the area of Washington, and they therefore pay more state and local taxes, in other words the recent study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure under which most of the small companies are organized - in District, Maryland, and Virginia rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a much faster growth rate than corporate taxes as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes throughout the country will probably last this year, with an increase in the overall increase in revenue for government and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the area of Washington could lag behind when the federal government's spending cuts affect the labor market in the region.
Partner city: German Beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - this is also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's twin town now wishes to become a brewery and hopes to have a flight direct link between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt partner city of Guangzhou, is the urgent wish of officials in China.
"We would be delighted if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said the deputy secretary of South China, Li Yiwei, who visited his town this week.
Time and again, the role of the Chinese Communist Party returned in the course of the call to this concern of the twelve-million metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also known as the canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
Thus, people also appreciated the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD-Chairman Thorsten SchäegerGümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be listening to Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"For beer, it does not take much, added good water, cereals and joys of life," added lunch with the party top in Guangzhou.
Mr Li, who radiates like this, already radiates, he flattered the host.
As a result, Guangzhou, which operated with Schäfer Gümbel, joined it with red wine, which was served to dinner.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German law of purity.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a flight link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said vice-leader Li.
Lufthansa offered the flight earlier, but in 2012, it was cancelled for economic reasons.
"it would be worth it," local politicians were convinced.
"Business transactions between our two cities continue to decline." 
At present, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in the province of Hunan.
The administration of Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for flight connections.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this wish when talking to the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," SchäegerGümbel responded - China's deputy minister Li Jinjun, a intimate connoisseur of Germany, nicknamed to say.
Thoughtful partnership
The leutary vice-leader of Guangzhou hopes that he can attend a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but it is not yet in this role.
He only came to office this year, after his predecessor was promoted from office on charges of corruption.
The local party chief Dr. Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is harshly enforced by Xi Jinping.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is extremely unusual within the Communist Party of China.
Before he took office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top manager in Fujian, where the Volkswagen Volkswagen built a great work.
Frankfurt has received more than a dozen twinning partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, which is 9000 kilometres away, is one of those which is maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange of students.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis of Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen, with its economic power.
Next year, she wants to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, Li reported.
The family of Joan Rivers "expresses the thumbs" 
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her arrival in a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has become hopeful that the 81-year-old woman is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa said today in a message.
We press all the thumbs down.
According to her mother, on Thursday her mother was delivered to the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency.
The doctors think they are deliberate and more accurate until they are more satisfied with their state of affairs, which will continue to be described as "serious." 
The reactions came from many pages, also in the form of an overwhelming online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaner and rising wages
In the future, more stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and dust collectors who come to trade from now on.
Just like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from 1 September get a label where the purchaser can see at one glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, more stringent nitrogen oxide values apply in the category of pollutant `Euro 6 '.
There is also more money for the scaffolders: They receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of EUR 10.25.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
Amazon just confirmed what was reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a lot of other things - buy the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million USD).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected to take over Twitch, but because it is widely believed that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago it looked as if the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google was made for a more cool billion, and cooperation was also natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it was quickly become a platform for players who wanted to release their bravoids in games, a "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The Twitter interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which better know the (most often older) games to give a painting of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is true that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy something bored is a textbook example of established technology that buys up a potential competitor.
It is a puzzle why the deal with YouTube did not happen, because the company reported that it was prepared to pay much of it like Amazon.
Everything we know at the moment is what we say about Emmet shear, president of Twitch: "We have decided on Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get faster." 
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they prefer to exercise sports than to do, it is hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others play the control panel instead of even the control panel.
It is one thing to watch a friend by 3 in the morning to look over the shoulder while it is shot by Resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a spider in the same way he is shot in his head 20 times after each other in Call of Duty.
You could see all of these games now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so without their own control they can be a good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick runs, in which the Roger Banners of our electronics age complete whole games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as it is not a game or a bit of humor, his Twitter channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do I know about sceptics like me?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could swallow.
But Twitch has something that any company would like to see: Thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of gaming," and the medium does not show signs of a contraction of shrinkage, and it does not appear as a spectator sport.
There was a lot of work on the castle at the castle in Burggarten.
The concept of the organizer agreed.
Despite the strong rain fall on Saturday evening, it is estimated that 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival of the Burggarten.
At times they had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel is the light and the fun.
Out of two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name of Amula.
Because the open air in the balance of salt is supposed to radiate brightness on the day and in the evening by various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from itself anyway.
This was already evident on the day of the morning when the first visitors to the Open Air started.
A party for all generations had promised the organizers.
And they have managed to do so.
Around the rest of the castle there was a cosy atmosphere of Salzwedeler, as well as guests from the near and further surroundings.
They followed the first live performances, wippes with the foot in the beat, very cool drinks - in short: Pure relaxation and pleasure were needed.
And that across the generations.
While one of the most popular white sand beaches on the beach bar is located on the beach bar, there is a quarter of wine in the wine cellar, where you will find a big attraction for our smaller guests, at a quarter of wine in the wine cellar.
But also in the case of children's shirts, the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had to do all of their hands in order to become the crowd and create imaginative creations in the small faces.
The bigger ones used the Kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot-crew taught from balance.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he raced to the visitors, especially looking for families who were looking for space and dry.
But the appeal of the festival did nothing to stop it.
"More people came as expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of" success on the whole line.''
So there is nothing to do with a repeat of the big party next year.
Although I have to work on the content and the size of the event, Sem made clear in a first record on Sunday with the vote of the people.
As annoying, he described it as annoying that in the meantime they had to be stopped.
Apparently, the security firm had been booked with too little effort.
The result: Some who had already paid no longer came to the area.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were living in the castle garden.
There have been problems with regard to sound technology.
This is why the combination of hives of hip-hop bands broke off their performance.
The technicians were unable to achieve a fairly reasonable sound.
The planned Shishade lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to balance because of a tyre cup.
"next year they will be included," says the organizer of the event.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Airs was more than possible from the number of visitors.
And in case of bad weather.
However, the organizers made a number of mistakes which will be postponed for the first time, but we need to put a stop to the second edition.
Also on the social network of Facebook the organizers have to make a criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros we were simply expecting more," Melanie Meier commented on the event page.
"You have unfortunately taken a bit of it to you," comments Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others do not really see the initial problems so closely.
I think it is very good that some people are not just being foolish, but also that they really try to get on their feet.
Hats off!," writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now it is time for the organisers to put an end to these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinking
This is not how it is expected.
On the contrary, the prepared component is waiting to be used in the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation radar is the sac which is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
But it is still world record.
The last step to complete the new case is the Kappentausch.
The upper part of the old casing is separated and reduced by a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new envelope will be set.
If the weather is included, the action will take place on stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge has a pine tree.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain shouted so much when her icy water was cast over the head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge went painful.
A woman was taken to hospital after she had been so busy with the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she gave out the jaws.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain raced so much when her icy waters were cast over the head that injured her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was the act, my jaw remained simple," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is thrown over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that did not happen, the pine was left, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this and made himself laugh almost in the pants, but I had to get into the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was delivered to the hospital to release the jaws after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the associations of Burgundy soon be pulling together?
Finally, there has always been a succession between the two Wolfratshauser Burgundy.
Now we are thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former Chairman of the Wolfratshauser Castle of Burgundy, initiated the project in the French Guédelon.
Only a year ago there was no good climate between the castle of Burgundy and the Wolfratshausen Castle.
So far, the positions of view have differed so far as to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving: Talks are soon to be held on joint action.
This is confirmed by the leaders of Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgundy friends) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and I suggested that we be able to sit again," reports Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both clubs could join forces in the future.
This is how we can see results which are more rapid.
While the Burgundy friends of the late Richard Dimbath had just seen the reconstruction of the castle in front of the mountain forest, Sjöberg Castle of Sjöberg is at the forefront of the area.
Herbert Piffl, the president of the Castle of Burgundy, was very pleased to receive his/her call.
Since Dimge's death, he faces the Castle of Burgundy.
A new Chairman is to be found in a general assembly in the middle of September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club is currently about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend, Richard Dimbath, we have been able to keep out of respect to club activities." This" thinking phase'' was needed to "consider how to proceed." 
According to Piffl, the new president will then attend the discussion with the Burgverein.
Until then, the people of Burgundy could also make a current mood of mood within their group.
There are no candidates for the presidency at the moment, Piffl says.
But I am confident that someone will find himself, because he has his home in Bad Tölz.
The new chair should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to continue working on the project "which is very popular.
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffling in the near future.
He honours Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two of the more advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air-lock.
They are a tourist magnet due to a high participation of the population and volunteers from all over the world.
Piffl: "I was also sceptical at the beginning.
But over time I have come to believe that it makes sense to promote the project.
There is nothing to do with this.
In addition, the project would be financed through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believing that Piffl believes.
"I do not want to take the idea of reconstruction simply on board personally," he hopes that the Burgverein on this point might make a difference.
Their goal of first documenting the history of history is "important and good." 
After that, we could look further.
A clever way to save time
Since the cost of university textbooks is more than $1,000 per year for many students, the fast second-rate student, Matt Schroeder, overcame a clever saving idea.
He invented a rental system for books of students of higher semesters and offered nominal compensation to delay sales.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-kek," Schroeder said, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books that were needed for the last semester would cost him $430, he said.
He gave off 120 $120.
The government has said that students spend an average of more than 1,200 dollars a year on textbooks and study material, but that there are various cost reductions for students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution to the choice of students.
The renting of textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book a semester, often at a much lower price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookshops, has announced that the renting of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about one quarter of the books in the college bookshops was rented in the spring Spring, as Neebos said Tevor Meyer.
According to the Association of College Stores, less than half of all textbooks are purchased from the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the unique one for the best deals.
Buying online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are in the campus bookshop.
The ninth edition of "calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is estimated at nearly $290, but it can be obtained at the specialized school bookmaker Chegg.com for 239.99 $.
Needed to Buy
If one of the notes of other or normal usage tracks does not make up, used books are a good option.
It was used on Chegg.com for 93.49 $.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduated at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second edition of "Strategic Media Decision: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business." 
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether previous expenditure was permitted.
Sometimes the updates for seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditures can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com of eBay Inc is a popular alternative to used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth a consideration if you are treating them reasonably well, it is worth thinking about returning them and you do not wish to keep the books after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly bought book.
For example, a student could rent "calculus" for the duration of one semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the terms of the business you rent, also about the penalty charges which may apply to the writing of notes, discounts or usage tracks.
Beware: If you do not return the book, the penalty charges can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books as well as traditional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers like Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey tells us that students often find the best offers in literary courses, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look at it.
Joe Gault, 29 who will soon be visiting Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for books as you can be sure that you can find the right textbook.
And before placing an online order, you should check according to whether the book is in stock and whether it is in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that delivered four weeks and finally paid the full price in the College-Book.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" 
"The Expendables 3" of Sylvester Stallone, who played less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the United States, while" Sin City: A lady to Kill For'' played only $12 million of his budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape tailored to Cameron Diaz" played just $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films like" dragons slightly'' also disappoint the revenue.
One article of the telegraph-film critic Robbie Collin indicates that for children's films, the lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves.
In 2014, Collin described 2014 as "the worst year for children." 
However, in films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic assessment for each summer film, which was presented between the American Memorial Day and the 20th July 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 screens.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics, and indicate that this year's film hits are equal to those of last year.
Some commentators suggest that development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who currently works on Disneys's upcoming jungle movie, said to the web site Hollywood Reporter: "I think the times change." 
We have to accept that and not try to move on from the past.
In contrast to the currently weak results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated sales of $1.2 billion in streaming content, nearly twice as much as in last year, when sales amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the filmstudios for focusing too much on the filming of comics, predicting a "core melting" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy might well contain a real core.
However, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic, however, because it is anticipated in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World.
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in the cash flow recently as simply "cyclical" and he said to Hollywood reporters:" The next summer will be the biggest summer on the cinema, and no one will worry about business.''
When a couple of years ago, the second table tennis area for tightening up the league division was removed, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result: Anyone who has not opened up has dropped off.
For example, although the class of the highest team of Torpedo in the Oberliga-Relegation has avoided the descent, there is only five fifths of the season in the coming season.
It is also one of the oldest in the world to be classified as one of the most popular in the world.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start up in the Dutch league, as are the boys of the SC Weende.
SG Lenglers and the torpedoes enter the new association of associations, and there are no Dieu clubs in the National League.
Among the women, TTV Geismar is part of the Association of Companies, Torpedo-Second in the National League.
What looks like a better district class is the new district of the South.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC are present.
In the district league there is a regional representative of Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Rot-Weiß, Bovender SV II and teams of TTV Geismar II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III begin at least in place.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the game.
In the area of the county, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllgraben are being launched.
With a team of nine teams.
The SC Weend sends his girls to the small county league.
Even the season of the SCW boys - there is still Torpedo II - it is not complete.
In a district class go Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV in the season.
In the first season of the newly founded RegionsAssociation, the two godins start a circle with nine teams.
In the west season it is the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Among them are Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Dame-Kreisleague consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in Osterode, where there are no longer any kind of ladies" thugs.
What is striking is that none of the six 2.district classes reaches the target strength, that the innovative and rotating district will have to worry about it.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests from opposition to the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people in the centre of Newport assembled to an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people met in Cardiff in front of the local town hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been listening to us about the events of the weekend and has spoken to demonstrators who have travelled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains
After being caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW, two young Buschwanders have been brought into safety with the rope winch.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke in Govetts Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday in Blackheath.
Worried relatives called around 20 p.m. the police when the two had not returned to their homes.
A search crowd from local police and rescue services broke out and the couple was found around 23 o'clock in the vicinity of the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had fallen to his knees and the man crashed and stood up to his head.
Rescuers stayed overnight at the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in a stable state with a ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Anti-government protests to escalate in Pakistan
Around 1000 demonstrators have been pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After a good half of an hour, the transmitter resumed it.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged equipment in the editorial.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the Heads of Government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
The police told us, around a kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, that on Monday some 3,000 demonstrators have returned with security forces.
A police officer was injured after hospitalization.
On the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when protesters tried to invade Sharifs.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military called on Sunday evening after a meeting at the army headquarters for a political settlement of the conflict "to waste without time and use force." 
It continued in the communication: "The Army remains committed to its role to ensure the security of the state." 
The escalation of violence has incited concern over intervention by the military, which has had a more frequent use of it in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to withdraw.
Khan and Qadri had been calling on their supporters on Sunday to resist.
"We will not go back without having forced to resign," said Khan.
This was similar to that of Gaddafi.
Khan accuses Sharif of having won the parliamentary election in May last year as a result of fraud.
Qadri is calling for the resignation of Central and provincial governments.
Then there is to be a transitional government to reform the electoral system and launch new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had initially had a peaceful front in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them on the weekend to invade Sharifs's residence.
Hütteldorfer after two season victory on place three of the table.
With the 2: 0 over Grödig, a conciliatory end has taken place on Sunday for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an interim head with the end of the Europa League on Thursday.
"The sensation of success was extremely important," confirmed Captain and Torprotect Steffen Hofmann, who met with three with green in white.
With the second season of the season, Schrammel-dreamtor brought the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season of the season and goes into the country of play with a sense of success.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said Mr. Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his magnificent Executive Volley from the Sixties of the 14th.
"I thought I was looking forward to the whole of the morning of Thursday, and I took it under the bar," said the 26-year-old smile.
When Schrammel met on 13th November 2010 in a Bundesligapartie, this was still for Ried.
This is why he will remain in a special memory of the first championship in the Rapid-Dress.
"For me, this is something very special, I am from the Rapid-back," said Schrammel.
Due to the short delay of Mario Pavelic of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side, also making it a very good thing.
He has enough experience of being able to exercise this position as well.
The door is worthy of him, he has already done some of the assists this year," and he praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also supplied the flank to 2: 0 by Hofmann after good one hour that finally brought the decision.
It would have been possible for our guests to write.
"Thank God we have had luck in luck today," Schrammel also remarked that the gap between performance and result in recent weeks was that" The results did not vote, but that the playful was always good compared to last year.
Barisic even found that in many games it was better than it was today - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium in this season." 
The first three-point since 26 July has therefore shown that the team structure has remained intact despite the setbacks: "Today, my team has shown that it is character." 
For him, it is equally gratifying that we have finally played out to zero
A lot of work during the country break also has the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger, several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start gate, making victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget that," Barisic, who lost with Behrendt and Pavelic in the last three days," which has been very stable recently.
This is why it is important to use the duration of the country in order to "pick up" wounds in physical area.
One who seems to have a special break is Captain Hofmann.
He treads for the team, passes through pain.
Especially at this difficult stage, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," he noted Barisic.
Hofmann gave the piece Rapids in front of his mistake in the 68th minute, but he also achieved the second goal.
For the 33-year old who completed his 350 victory, it was the first match out of the game since November 2nd, 2013 (4: 2 on the Admira).
Hofmann: "Do not believe that everything is good now" We surely have a bit of luck, but at some point the luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
He warned, of course, that it should be concentrated: "You must not always see it in black and white.
We have not been playing so badly in recent weeks, as has been pointed out.
However, we must not believe that everything is good now.
He was unable to dispute the importance of his role to the team.
It is a very young team which I can help at the moment.
This seems to me to be at mine in certain stages," Hofmann said.
Val Coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team.
He also regretted the rapid opposition of "Leader in the category of magic" and the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which was wrongly recognized by referee colleagues.
The only criticism I can make to the team is that we have not been sufficiently concrete in the direction of Tor in a number of stages.
We have had too few accounts.
It looked similar: "It has started badly in the same way, we have found it alone and even made a gate.
By and large, more would have been.
There is a Ruh at that summit
We showed a powerful tribe when we were trying to resolve the summer series "I am lucky by the Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these trees still exist in the county, which is the "scourges" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A walking tour of the area climbs up to the 600 years old oak.
It goes past Koppeln, from Basalt to Basalt.
A little bit below the quarry of the Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, it stands.
Vital looks out over the other trees of the area and reminds us of an amount of more than eight meters of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only mention of the registered name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheimer archives and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what the life of the disease is.
The result of his research was a sober explanation of the name.
Until about 80 years ago, until about 80 years ago, the goatbrains were driven by their animals of Unterweißenbrunn from on the laborious and liberated fields of rock.
At the foot of the tree, the survivors of the climb are supposed to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its significance, because on the grassland there is actually goat herds.
The area has also been declared to be the core zone of the biosphere reserve, as Schneider found out.
You should be careful when entering the stone formations, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place to cross.
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but it is slightly hidden.
There are also signs to the direction of Hochrhön which invite you to take a short hike.
Where is the castle of Wasserburg?
However, a waterway which is sought after our next task is less likely to be found.
There is already a good impression of the building in the ditch, but we have some historic buildings in the county to which the building of the building could fit.

After weeks of diving, Italy's prime minister, Matteo Renzi, won last week the nomination of his Foreign Minister, Federica Mogherini, against strong conservative opposition at the EU special summit last week, and she becomes the successor of British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, like the government near La Repubblica daily newspaper, regards the appeal of his Mogherini, who is also the favorite in the government, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes that he will also calm his party base against him, because Mogherini is assigned to this.
With regard to the conservative representatives with the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker and the President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion is in Rome in order to achieve a political settlement.
At the same time, the EU's chief diplomat will chair the President of the Commission, Mr Juncker.
The agreement of the European Parliament that is still pending is certain to be certain.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Giorgio Napolitano would scarcely have known a "key recognition" of Italy's role in the EU to the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD).
The optimism of La Repubblica is that for nearly two decades it will be possible to show the tried and tested fashion of fashion that is well known to her ambition.
The born Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began with his doctorate in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined us in 2008 with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita to today's Social Democrat PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election of 2001 in the left-wing Democratic Party Council, it entered high party politics, and it worked in the foreign policy whose director she soon became.
They occupied traditional foreign policy priorities such as the Middle East, and studies on NATO in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved in a contingent of troops, used the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and among the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as Secretary of State.
If the PD once again has a better relationship with the strong Middle East peace movement, which contributed to more than 40% of the party's vote in the EU elections in May, then, as is recorded in PD-circles, Federica Mogherini is part of it.
Brussels, which has too few diplomatic experience in Brussels, lacks substance, and it is working in the PD.
In Brussels, especially from Poland and the Baltic, realistic fashions of fashion to the crisis in Ukraine are being persecuted and diffused as "course of Russia." 
It is in favour of the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company, Gasprom, which is intended to transport Russian gas directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi took up his presidency as president of the EU in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first visit to Moscow.
Photos that they showed with Putin at the Shake-Hands were greeted with indignation in Brussels, just as they invited the Kremlin chief to a economic summit in October.

The Socialists in France should say "hold the mouth, and France to order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the disputed socialist president, while his cabinet of cabinet has come up against the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain on his side," he said with great applause.
As a palliative gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite strong calls for a relaxation of the regime of the new Minister for Economic Affairs, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urgently called on his co-socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, drew sand into the gearbox, in which she appeared at a meeting of socialist Members of the Socialist Group, and criticized the Socialist Party for accepting the French "faith in its future." 
Marine Le Pen, the National Front leader who is on the right, popped up the Socialists" permanent struggle to fight, and said they could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a couple of months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, she is forced to form a new government if the old does not survive a summer.
"and the new will not survive autumn or winter," Miss Le Pen said to supporters.
She repeated the call of her party after a dissolution of Parliament, and said she was confident that he would be able to come out as the victors in early retirement, and that she would be willing to become a government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the March elections and the right-wing National Front, and the EU elections in May.
A poll in Sunday magazine Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party is in danger of crumbling into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation can continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion USD
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, NCHL.O, which is the third largest hub in the world, will conduct advanced negotiations for the acquisition of the Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion according to the experts of the industry.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruises of Prestige Cruises and its prosperous clientele, while competing with larger rivals like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday, and they warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, since the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond on request to comments, while a Apollo spokesman rejected a comment.
The company based in Miami operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, and 13 percent compared with 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand name Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for $1.2 billion for 2013, a 6% increase in comparison with the previous year.
The cruise industry is around $29 billion in total, and in the coming years it is expected to be strengthened as a result of strengthening the middle class in emerging countries like China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the stock exchange at US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since an 850 million $deal 2007.
In its current form in the year 2000, Norwegian Cruise was created by a merger with a crossroad of Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino under the control of the Malaysian billionaire of Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration authorities, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP 8 percent of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have together, according to the original registration documents for the Prestige Cruises stock, have 82% of the passenger capacity on American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A pective group drew the Chinese flag close to the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law which allows for only two or three candidates for Hong Kong's leadership in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a nominating committee, which is likely to be occupied with pective members.
As a result of this decision, it will become almost impossible for opposition democrats to become a party to election, and to have pro-democracy activists to make up for their threat and paralyse Hong Kong with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leaders worry that the calls for democracy are extended to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper in which Chinese dominance of Hong Kong was presented in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region where hundreds of thousands of people marched in the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Lis questioning is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Office of the Affairs of Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei should be consulted on the day of the day.
Student activists announced that they will gather in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the head of the leadership of Hong Kong.
Britain had no democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
In Kiev, Putin calls for the start of "state negotiations" with the eastern Ukraine.
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday, Russian media reports that the Ukrainian government will stop fighting against the separatists of the east of the country, and will immediately accept negotiations on the "sovereign" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov subsequently made clear that Putin did not mean that this would be part of Russia under the control of the separatised area of eastern Ukraine, but that his status with Ukraine needs to be redefined in order to give power to the Russian-speaking region to represent his rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to Kiev's government to negotiations on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, has been in line with the strategy of which he appeared since the beginning of the riots over five months ago.
In an interview with the state channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently known the territory that has been taken as "Novorossija" or" Neurussyland,'' a term that reminds us of the pre-revolutionary shining time of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all of those who, in the course of Ukrainian politicians" campaigns, are attacking civilian communities in civilian communities held by separatists are hoping for imminent peace talks in their illusions,'' Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately start detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the status of the state of South-East in order to preserve the interests of the people who live there," he said.
Peskov has said that Putin's reference to statehood needs to be seen in context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed since months from the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that which cultural and linguistic rights are endangered.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said "it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine." 
The Kremlin's clarification of the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks emphasized the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, unlike the direct pressure of Crimea, which is the majority of the other million inhabitants of ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk to eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys before the conflict resulted in a large majority to stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy that was mentioned by Russian diplomats on international forums would give authority to the regional governments of Ukraine to negotiate their own trade and external relations, by which the Kremlin can de facto control an area that links the Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula annexed to the Black Sea five months ago is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
During his speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislation, after new elections, should take account of the constitution of the constitution, which gives greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, accused of arming and incitement to Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing followed another of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded the Baltic Sea, which was formerly a peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the hands of Ukraine, which, according to Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, controlling Nowoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to be attached to Mariupol, which is located between Nowoasovsk and narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels, and urgently asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on a point where there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on specific actions, and the leadership called for the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which is to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers have had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week in order to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, returning to Kiev on Saturday on Saturday.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped in Ilowajsk as a result of Russian incursions were replaced on Sunday against 10 Russian parachutists who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko informed on Sunday.
Nude photography scandal around Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his annoyance about hackers who probably stolen nude images of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a who Who is Who has stolen the A-promis from Hollywood.
The film town is in turmoil after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence has appeared in a hacking scandal of celebrity on the internet.
The hacker who was responsible for this probably has more than 60 nude photos from Lawrence, Star of the Tribute of panem and superstars, among them the models of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the boys of Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were reportedly publicised on the basis of an ijacent.
The list includes 101 celebrities.
Edelsten, who had loomed with Grecko last month, said to Confidential: "It is disgusting." 
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and sold to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, said that there was a news page that Hack was "shameful," and that the people affected felt" injured.''
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with their ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures in which they are on top of a pool.
Palmer's film works include love of love and an invincible with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch was not available yesterday for comments on the chopped pictures.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ that "It is a heinous violation of privacy." 
Actor Seth Rogen denounced the hacker in his Tweet: "hacked images from one cell phone is nothing else than the sale of pet goods." 
From a purely legal point of view, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Yesterday at 8 Radler, Jogger and hikers joined the Great Feldberg and supported it with the help of children with cancer.
The tour, which was a tortur for the tour, was a light training for the other.
Everyone agreed on one thing: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski was lucky to have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus drove on the Feldberg with the wheel yesterday.
For the good purpose.
It can easily be taken away from the small muscle cater, especially when he personally brought a valuable insight to his participation in the 8th Radeln in the Great Feldberg in favour of the Association "Help for Create-bound children" (Frankfurt).
It is a great deal.
"I know now that I can do this!" 
What do you have to do is to help you?
In the snow, if I had stopped once, from having had something to do with it.
As Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Oberurseler city council, tormented many of the 718 participants yesterday in the early days of mountains, and came close to exhaustion, they were happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it has been easier to overcome the eleven kilometres long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
The green man who appears in red - red dress, red bike - started on understatement at the start of understatement ("Any number of professionals, there is the goal to come!), but on top of the mountain proved to be half a professional, and after 45 minutes it went without breathing around the finish.
He has also taken the track through one of the slides, like Nina Kuhn, pressesprecherin of the town of Oberursel, who together with Frank Grüneisen was on the way.
For the two triathletes, "Feldberg" was not necessarily a sporting challenge:" this is about charity, we like to go with it - we would have made an exit we have already done,'' so Kuhn is.
On the move they met Paul Wenzel of Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) was driven to Oberursel in the morning in order to get back to the height again.
In the morning of 9 o'clock in the saddle, the Frankfurter Florian Zierz had a two time at home in the saddle, "made the Feldberg, and then with fun to roll with it.
It was also funny when it came to Fritten-Toni.
For the head of the Oberurseler cult kiosks, bike tours via the Feldberg are simply part of this.
He hit 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilogram race.
It is a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to do so," Andreas Balzke said.
The trained Mainzer says that he is a "more ambitious racer." 
He has to be the same because he has been on the road with the "Fixing wheel," but he is also racing wheel, but without switching a circuit.
The fact that there has been a more relaxed pace even without a wheel demonstrates not only the 20 hikers who climbed up over the White Wall and the distance to the top, as it is also a jog who, at a cordel, has a licence with weights behind himself.
Bergwacht-doctor told Professor Volker Lischke, who gave safety with his team, to safety with his team, who said: "The kenn from Frankfurt, which trains for a special sledge ride, only makes it possible for the sling to pull itself." The man is in a way to be his own sled.
The 718 participants - and hence as many people as ever before - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The trekkers are first at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed by 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later the first mountain bikers took off.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Radeln on the Great Feldberg," gave the start squads and wished the participants a nice trip.
He hopes that next year he will succeed in blocking the route to the Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
