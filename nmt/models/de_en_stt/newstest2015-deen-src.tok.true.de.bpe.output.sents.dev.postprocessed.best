Reverting to the very American ideal of work rights as human rights
The congressional Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal in order to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil law.
"How trade unions die, middle class jobs die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and vice-chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud to present the Staff Regulations Act together with the civil rights representative of John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities of discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions such as other forms of discrimination - and stops so anti-union forces.
The addition of the national law on labour law, in order to create an option of discrimination against workers who are involved in the organisation of a union, in order to act against a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or criminal money - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - in any case, it is not in accordance with American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other sponsors of their bill propose is the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have been facing in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries around the world - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and respect labor rights.
There was a time to recall millions of Americans when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that workers and their trade unions have a role to play in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "the rights of workers in unification and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed." 
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff ordered the Germans to write a constitution that would make fascism replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organise themselves, and their voice should rise in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly said: `the right to establish associations in order to safeguard and improve labour and economic conditions and to improve each individual and every profession.
Agreements that limit this right or aim to diminish it are null and void; objective measures are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, from which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone is entitled to form or join trade unions to protect his interests." 
For generations, Americans have been accepting the basic premise that human rights are human rights.
When this country told other countries how to shape civilian and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union should then be protected by collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies.
In the face of these rights in America, it is indeed very wise to see the American ideal, which is why the working population must have the right to unite and to make itself heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now, everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By increasing the standard of living of millions of people, labor has created a market for industry and has increased the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves it.
History reminds us, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination against the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and that soldered the promise of democracy.
Judge stops under law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could be shut down.
On Sunday, a federal judge stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana by which lawyers said that it would probably have led to the closure of all five deportations of the state.
This measure, which was imposed on law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June, on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out abortions to acquire a patient's alert at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
The decision of the judge, however, is that the doctors can temporarily continue to conduct legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiff can continue working in accordance with the law when they try to gain these rights," wrote Federal judge John degravelles, in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing is scheduled for the judge in order to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion supporters welcomed the decision made in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors take so much time to obtain hospital transfer rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana escape a misguided law that wants them to respect their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President, and chairman of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who had taken charge of the law on behalf of three of the five hospitals of the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately obvious whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who were not involved in the complaint and had also asked for the right of transfer.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have issued similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for non-constitutional purposes.
Key points of a law in Texas that most of the hospitals remaining in the state would have been forced to close were stopped by a German judge on Friday.
The American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, have agreed that the rights of doctors" rights demand unnecessary restrictions.
Anti-abortion opponents believe that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some have also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortion in Louisiana has patient identification, has shared the centre of reproduction rights.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced not to carry out abortions, this doctor would no longer do the surgery out of fear of his safety.
In their argument against the ruling, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the execution of abortion while their applications would still be pending on patients' rights.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best means of treatment lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video record for their mother, who died in 2007 on ovarian cancer.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of egg cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women, during which the use of ovarian cancer was detected in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive after diagnosis.
The research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in the rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDEN: New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian cancer.
The researchers investigated the medical care of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman influenced the chances of survival when it comes to diagnosis, type of egg cancer, existing pretreatment and social and economic status.
For older women and those whose cancer has already progressed at the time of diagnosis, the rate of survival was the lowest.
For those who lived in the rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women who live outside the city died of higher probability of cancer of eggs, Dr. Jordan suspected a belated diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best handled by gynecological oncologists, and these can mostly be found in major cities," she said.
In spite of the improvement of telemedicine services, in order to counter the distances, it proposed an increase in the service of frozen doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women to their place of residence, as well as to treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term growth rate for women in the ovarian cancer and emphasized the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study carried out by Rio Tinto to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast, discovered that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden Centres Have to lose Home ownership
The decline along with an increase in the number of household owners under the age of 35 could result in garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds per year when today's young consumers meet after a study of HTA as reported in the Financial Times, the "core age group for garden products." 
The report states that tenants spend on an average of 55 percent of the amount people spend with home for their garden.
The increase of people who live in highly urbanised areas without gardens is the popular practice of paving the way to land parks, and the decline in garden size are other factors that threaten the sector in which £5 billion per year is spent on sale.
In the area of London where, over a period of 6 years, the share of homeowners fell from 61 to 43%, the lowest spending on garden products per household will be reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens do not mean that people can not draw plants
Guy Barter, head chef for the RHS, said: "Container heaters are very popular with tenants for example because they can carry their plants on a move." 
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade from the late 1980 to the mid-1990s between 1997 and 2005.
He also predicted an improved market situation because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergy of Tahirul Qaddafi, led to Pakistan.
In the capital of Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators have teamed up with the state TV station PTV.
Minister of Education Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protestors back from PTV building.
The station opened its premises for about 40 minutes, but it has been sent back in the meantime.
At the same time, around 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About one kilometre away they were equipped with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police replaced Trenengas.
The protesters called for Sharifs, but they rejected it.
In the meantime, the army of the country is calling for a political settlement of the conflict, without wasting time and without applying force." 
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday night, the military stated: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state." 
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more widely used.
Opposition politician Imran Khan proposes Premier Sharif when parliamentary elections were betrayed in May last year.
The protests escalated at the weekend after Khan and Qaddafi called upon their followers to invade Sharifs residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appointed US diplomat due to espionage reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed the former US diplomat of the country a record of a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the director of the US embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept said that from the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, Turkey demonstrated that Turkey was a major activity area for US and British intelligence.
According to Turkish intelligence agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dealt with the importance of the report and has said that all major countries have been spired by each other.
A previous report that also focused on the most important intelligence service in Germany in Ankara caused much angry reactions from the Turkish Government.
Warning strike: Train drivers are threatened with consequences for commuters.
The nationwide warning strike of the train drivers on Monday night could also affect the movement of persons in NRW.
The exhibition that was announced for 18 - 21 p.m. was held all over Germany, including the long-distance, regional and S-Bahn -LRB- city rail -RRB- traffic.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the movement of goods.

Said the district chairman of the trade union of the German Railways -LRB- GDL -RRB-, Sven Schmid, Düsseldorf.
We are counting on significant cases.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the movement of goods.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that everything should be done to minimise the impact.
But the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike so that it would be difficult to anticipate the consequences.
Police of Magaluf of Corruption
On Friday, the prosecutor presented evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The head of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption allegations by businessmen and barbarians in the infamous Binge-water hotspot Magaluf.
After corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and night clubs of Magaluf lie in custody, the main Commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, was taken into custody detention.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutor presented the office of the Public Prosecutor for the fight against corruption on Friday by police and employees of the city of Calvià.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the allegations of corruption, and together with Navarro they are consulted by a judge.
The national Spanish newspaper ABC reported that the angry night watchdog said that the authorities' cronies have a serious impact on their business.
"It is no longer worth making money, it is about survival," one of the businessmen says the court.
Let our livelihoods emerge from the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer due to a viral YouTube video, Magaluf released international headlines in which an 18-year-old British tourist was shown to live in 24 men during a walk Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to halt the illegal behaviour of non-alcoholic tourists in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants to the notorious alcohol-free bar tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the coat case took place, was forced to close a year for closure, while Playhouse and Bar Carnage together have to pay a penalty of 55,000 €-LRB- $73.000 -RRB-.
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is popular especially for young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents under the flow of alcohol, including the "balconing" trend where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions is affected by flights from Adelaide Airport.
Spring has brought South Africa a winter surprise, with fierce spectacles and a strong wind that interfered with flights from the Adelaide airport.
In the evening till 21 p.m. there was another 5mm rain on the town, after 6,6mm, which had already taken place in the night on Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy shrubs, including a cup that began shortly before 20 the clock and caused almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter had taken last week for an early dose of spring, the temperature in the city on Monday fell to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C
The bad weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of the flight of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane would have been landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but it was taken by a storm wind - a sudden change of the wind speed or direction of a short distance - and had to run through.
There were about 50 km @/@ h on the ground at the airport of Adelaide.
The flight data showed that the plane had to run during a second landing flight and that the plane was finally opened at about 20.40.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: The highest time is a great deal of light.
In the face of the technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech circuits, our columnist Bernd Matthies is in touch with an extremely familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this here, my view falls to the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, like retro this is this?
But there is a thought behind it: If the cable would not be, it would be possible to fly all the listeners in the house in the shortest possible time, and that would be a lot more than that.
In any case the ekeltronic -LRB-
No, typos: Electronic -RRB- sector is the rule that the novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow - bought - outdated.
And anyone who, for example, has a tube of TVs in the living room, merely says that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressure of the Ifa at the radio tower this week we see our absolute incompetence in the issues of electronics.
The avalanche that once blindly dominated washing machines and CD players nowadays does not even understand the purpose of the devices that will spread to him with untouchable expertise in front of him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" the press office promises us.
Yes, what is it about?
What are we talking about talking to people who seem to be voluntarily spreading such Quark?
In fact, for about 20 years we have been talking about linking our house.
This is how the yoghurt itself is used to inform us of the fire of the holiday on the Maldives that it burns in the working room.
And would it not be wonderful when we get from the office to the air conditioning to our early arrival?
Yes, this will require air conditioning.
But one dream will certainly soon come true: We lift our watch, they say according to "suction!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner drives away.
Misleading.
All of this goes beyond anything less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred," a branch of the industry, connecting the washing machine with an headphones, the steam garer sends the weather report and the data brille shows how long the pizza is still needed in the oven, how long the pizza is still needed in the oven, something that benefits
We also know from everyday practice: If a newly changed device is really desperately needed, the battery is empty.
Another reason for this is that the ring cable will also survive the next radio show.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the areas near Gaza returned to schools on Monday when they spent the summer in air conditioning while missile and mortar went to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school launch brought the communities of Israel to the south of Israel a feeling of joy and anticipation, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod the staff of the "Pashosh" child garden who was taken by a rocket, before the meeting of the students Granatsplitter came out of the walls and sliding doors.
"We have a bit of fear, but they are excited," Ronit Bart said.
Many children in our area desperately need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that it is a bit funny to go again to school.
"These were difficult times, and we did not go out of the house," they said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz close to the border with Gaza to offer its support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of residents of the border communities like Saad left their homes in their homes or left their homes in order to move away from Gaza in safer areas, and to escape the missile and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar granate, hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were provisionally placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza that has been badly drawn from the Palestinian attack.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "We will make sure you acquire knowledge and offer security." 
Israel and Hamas agreed on an open-ended ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire gave rise to an immediate end to the fighting, but major problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for a repeal of the Israel-Egyptian blockade of Gaza, and the reopening of air and seaports in Gaza.
Israel is calling for a disarming of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two soldiers killed during the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them were civilians, and at least 494 children were suspected of the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that it is at least half of those who were killed, but it did not provide any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fighting against Israeli cities, most of the country's south.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks were damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza region and some 250,000 people in more than 100 UN schools that have been rebuilt in temporary protective spaces.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protected areas, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the year last week.
"I hope the school will soon be open so that we can learn how the children in the world and the Jewish children are said, Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl puts NPD-prohibition procedures into question.
In view of the failure of the NPD in Saxony, the German Federal Constitutional Court of Appeals has spoken in favour of an end to the current NPD-prohibition procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - I think the current prohibition against NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should be brought to an end.
"The NPD is worse off than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDULandeschef in Baden-Württemberg, the" Leipziger Volkszeitung.''
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that leads me to achieve the result is that the NPD should be fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
During the vote on Sunday, the NPD failed at the five percent threshold.
A first attempt at a ban on the far-right party failed in 2003 because constitutional protection had also been at the top of the NPD head at the time.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag were not united.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the beginner, refugees will now be accommodated in tents.
The head office for refugees in Harburg is lined with all the seams.
Now the Internal Authority has put together three tents of the Red Cross.
The regional leaders were only briefly informed - they are hardly enthusiastic.
"This hatred continues to fuel citizens" concerns,'' says Britta Herrmann, Chairman of the Group of the Greens @/@ European Free Alliance, who is not able to contribute constructively to the humane settlement of refugees.
Your party demands that the district administration of Harburg currently makes unused houses available for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for filling up in the initial intake are the rush of help seekers - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide enough seats in subsequent facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay for longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Private Homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, so the RP-dates increased from Monday.
With this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9%, more than double the increase in the 12 months of August 2013, but the increases were not distributed evenly across the country.
The Research Director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne would introduce a two-tier market.
The figures from RP Data show that last year the home prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent, compared to 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending, and where prices increased by 1.4% over the year, is the other end of the scale.
Mr Lavless further said that, for the coming months, the increase in the real estate that would be sold would now be an increase in the real estate that would subject the market to a real test.
"When you look at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the ongoing low interest environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months." 
In an opinion on the New Press, it is contrary to the statements of the peer Medau and attests to this "as a Feldherr." 
The style of the university is not, it is in the communication.
So the family Medau had been orally informed about the University of the Hochschule in the middle of June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July are definitely wrong," as they say.
At the same time, it points out that there is no `preferences' in the case of the plans.
Also the extension of the narrow road that is necessary for access to the castle is less dramatic than by the Medaus.
It was not part of a nine-metre road and did not speak.
It's going to be at 5.50 meters, this is a metre wider than before," Pügen l explains.
The argument of the Medau operator that their free and trained parking spaces will only be used by students of the university will not be valid.
This is not acceptable because, as is the case with other public parking spaces, it can be solved intelligently.
Thinking of the Inhabitants
According to the Ministry of Education, the children's cricket is located on the ground and will lead to the entrance to the park deck in front of their door door.
On the contrary, it should be taken into consideration that this is not only a matter of the birth of the child, but also the proximity of the inhabitants to the arrival of the Friedrich-Stenses Street and the 800 students of the neighbouring Realschule.
In other words, it is a matter of much more than the specific interests of Mr Medau.
Whether the criticism of the child's wife was criticized, with the development of the road, one of the few natural spots of Coburgs would be entitled "can decide on the reader itself." 
In the beginning of October, Pügen l, together with the State Building Office of Bamberg, wants to inform the city authorities about the structural development of the Hochschule by 2020, raising the importance of new development in this context.
Peer Medau informed the parents of the kindergarten last week about the College's plans.
Therefore the access for the new park deck should not lead to the campus and to the Friedrich-Stenses Street, rather than the Medau-Berg.
This would mean that the narrow road of about one kilometre would have to be extended in a two-lane lane.
According to the high bills of the Medan, the traffic in the park would thus increase the rise of the castle of Hohenfels.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles every day.
Up to now, the town did not want to speak on the part of the city.
Glandorf is coming out of handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
For this decision, the 31-year-old of the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to health problems for this decision.
It is not easy for me to decide, it is over several months.
It is for me time to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," World Champion announced in 2007 on his Facebook page.
As a result, he has a record of 167 country games and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement.
Because he wants to go to Torehunt for a couple of years, he will no longer be available to the new German coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Islands, who announced his Kader for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf held a long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have impressed me in the same way as they will also inspire my many years of players and my successors.
But for my club, I would also like to be healthy in the coming years, so there is a need for longer regeneration breaks that do not allow the current double load.
In 2012, the left wing had to fear his career.
Because of the problems he had encountered, he had been treated by team doctors from the German Handballbunder -LRB- DHB -RRB- with a cortisonspritze, which was later caused by a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years will not pass past any body of your body.
I have some health sites that I can not ignore
After the three infection operations that took place in 2012, I have never managed to handle my blood pressure correctly.
There are a number of other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I controlled my head but I ca n't fool my body," Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine "Handball Time.''
For a comeback, it would only be available in absolute emergencies.
"When all stripes pull up, I'm always open to conversation," explained the two-fold family father of the trade journal.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can play handball.
I must also say that, after my long period of hospital in 2012, I have become rather devious to my health.
After my career, I would at least like to go to some extent.
In addition to the World Cup 2008 -LRB- HSG Nordhorn -RRB- and 2010 -LRB- TBV Lemgo -RRB- he took over in 2008 -LRB- HSG Nordhorn -RRB- and in 2010 -LRB- TBV Lemgo -RRB- of the EF-Cup.
In 2012, he also became a member of the European Football Championship with Flensburg.
The German Economy in spring by 0.2 percent
The crises around the world have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
From April to the end of June 2014, gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter.
This dealt with the Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone prospered the economy in spring while investment fell.
Foreign trade, too, has slowed down the economy.
For the first half of the year, the first half of the year will result in a 0.8% increase in GDP compared with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland Moolist" that took place on Sunday for the first time by the Burgmannsstadt.
The Burgmannstadt of Horstmar had an invasion of Dutch "Fietzel" on Sunday.
The largest cycling club in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Moolist." 
This is the biggest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
With their registration in Jos, over 1000 participants were thanked for the organization of this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various trade magazines.
We come from Den Helder and went overnight to participate in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland again in this way," cyclists cheered about the route through the villages of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration in the club's club you will find the Sta Foundation.
Katharina went to a small "peace" through the town on Wall, where the launch took place.
Further, the route that was advertised for three different categories, in the direction of Herrenholz above the Schöppinger mountain in the direction of Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes from 95 km to 1175 meters above sea level, 120 km with 1475 height meters and 145 km with 1775 meters of altitude the cyclists prove their good condition.
They were dressed up in Havixbeck and Billerbeck on the road.
The main organiser, Jos of Jos, and Mayor of the Mayor of Heinz Lölfing were delighted to hear the success of this cycling event.
We are happy and it was a nice experience for all those involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents', Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately there were not so many participants how the organiser had hoped what was probably the bad weather forecast and the moreful rain.
"In 2015 we are going to come back with nice weather on 30 August or during another weekend, but the cyclists were returning to the Münsterland and the organisers are planning a new run.
Konstantin wake up at the mercy of honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, politefully activist, ex-detainee, brought to paper in "monk and warrior" on 287 pages.
Not chronological, but more ideas for thought networks written his memoirs on 1 June 1947, each chapter is initiated by means of a matching song text.
And he is ruthless in this: From the Onanie to the shop he leaves no human weakness.
Also, to show how he has learned his own tolerance in dealing with his fellow men.
Broad scope also include abstract, but also more important terms: Love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of this he tries to go to the ground, to very philosophical, but also very personal.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment, and also his political commitment - and also how he has not only influenced the music -LRB- the opera lover became the soul and rock musician -RRB-, but also his prison stay.
The latter brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the asketic monk, as he says, "by means of subtraction" as he says," by leaving everything impossible.''
Between all of the most intellectual views, there are also short anecdotes to the earth: For example about thugs in a place frequented by GIs or a crazy trip in which he targets a tree.
He is also ruthless about this.
Lenny Henry: My father has never taken me into the arm.
Has never said "I love you" 
Henry was one of seven children of a family of seven children in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was 19, worked in a factory and was proportional to his relationship.
Henry tested for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, who were partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father, and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through a number of difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship to his father.
It was difficult to know him.
One could never see his face, only his voice was: `listen to the collar.
Allow your sister to rest in peace.
Get on with it!
I want to look at cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown when I was a child - went to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and while the conditions are better than his father's time, he won an insight in how his life for him was.
It is a bit brighter now, but they are dark, it is dark, it is thin, deep stylized labyrinths with flute and smoke and there is a lot of ash.
My father used to simply sit in the tub and then he could hear him slowly how he started to sing, because he was able to wash the foundry.
When I went around there, it became clear to me that he had done it for years to put the food on the table, and my respect for him was greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without love of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you." 
When my mother went wrong with the end of her life, we began, "I love you, I love you, I love you." 
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop doing this with "I love you" ?
Let me get rid of me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mother.
It is still French friend who married 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mother.
Henrys was his mother who was diabetic.
This contributed to their death.
When I was very busy and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said you must be radical.
So I took this workout through and had to make a drastic diet in order to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henrys's career change can be found in his elegant, short-lived bar.
Since he was praised by the critics of his Othello, he was united by the theater.
It followed the comedy of the verses, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and comers who have completed their busy working life.
He began with 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated, and wrote about him on New Faces.
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s and "I was for a rather long time of the only Black Imitator @/@ Comedian on TV." 
He learned in the job.
I had to learn not just from the public eye, but also from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient Witz narrative machine while I was through television a star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
As his manager had the stage of the stage of the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment programme in which the people called "black anmold," Henry introduced his comedy over five years.
It was very unpleasant when it came to my family.
I somehow desired that it would never have happened, but I do not regret that I have done so.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a" grotesque parody of the black people.''
By introducing figures that celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the 80s on an alternative Comedykreis.
The first row of the Lenny Henry Show went to the show in 1984, and in the 90s he was known among others as the head chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie Chef.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles were the following decade, but the BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought, "what you think you are doing next, Len, because it is all you like, you will just take the time of time or make a little at the place." 
After that, a documentary series for Radio 4 came with the title What's So Great About?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was completely allergic.
I had never properly learned anything about him at school and mainly held him for a domain of middle class, whites in tights and a carbon head in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench you should try it.
Do not make it bad if you do not know what you are doing.
Take a couple of words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare.
Henry made 20 lines out of Othellos's last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I felt I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put the head to me.
"Therefore it is a serious matter, it is serious, you will take your text seriously, searches a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece of months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that did not happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the verses.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed you." 
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt he had to maintain the audience.
"A little voice told me" you have to bridge 10 minutes while you repair the computer." 
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea would go as soon as the problem had been resolved.
I went from stage and anything in me said "Oh, thank God." 
I am not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so you will stay in your role." 
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was ambitious.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the eyes.
Also this came well, it is like a large sign of the gods who say to me "This is your determination." 
He says this, of course, with a deafening voice.
So I stand by it.
I really do.
I love to be in a sample room.
Henry is still the head of a comedian - our conversation is animated by humorous outbursts, while he is always imitating people.
I have decided not to make a stand-alone comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction is somehow dangerous to a room full of strangers.
If you look at it forever, you will go to a wall.
I sometimes run live in Apollo when I want to do so, but I do n't like it as much as I did before.
I ask him if he will once again make a stand-alone comedy tour.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a start, a middle section and the end of a journey - I do not think I want to give up again.
Is this its new incarnation?
I think so.
I am happy to be an actor.
It is fun.
One is always told about a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi-Rebellen blocking Road in Yemen's Capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi-Rebellen and the Yemeni government, the Huthis called the Huthis to civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi-followers held central roads in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman of the Huji party said "Ansar Allah." 
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report on a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "The Post" Huthi-leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for action on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened a further escalation of the conflict according to the information of the sheet, and his demands should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis fight for more independence from the Sunni government and demand the resignation of the government.
The population of the Huthi tribe has been besieged by the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps against the great movement of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, there is always bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya According to officials to contain "ghost workers" 
Kenya has begun to register all state officials in biometric terms to delete "ghost workers" from the government's pay lists.
Staff who do not register in the next two weeks if they were not paid was a statement of government.
The government is suspected that thousands of people will also receive salaries after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised when he took office in 2013 to fight corruption in the public service.
At the beginning of this year it was found that at least EUR 1 million -LRB- 700,000 £-RRB- was lost per month to payments for "clergy" and through other abusive financial practices.
The government assumes that salaries continue to be paid to accounts after one person has died or after the public service leaves Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear in the next two weeks of identification centres to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are received in a government response.
Anyone who would not have done this without a credible excuse, the communication went further.
"This action will contribute significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and correcting the pay list on both levels of government - in this way, the" ghost workers" will be eliminated, "said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary of the Ministry of decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal of art adviser Helge Achenbach will be held in court on 11 November for the first time.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi Gründers Theo Albrecht, are calling for compensation from Achenbach and two of his companies who are in insolvency proceedings in a civil process at the Düsseldorf District Court.
This was shared by a lawyer on Monday.
In the lawsuit, Achenbach betrayed the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and ordered Berthold Albrecht higher prices than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach purchased for 121 million euros of items for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was born in the School of Education at the age of 44, of which 23 was the head of school.
From this time of time, Manfred Richter knows a lot of Petershausener and Kollbach from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his efforts to see people in the student.
The snow is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif of his homeland.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau @/@ North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14 he became the teacher of the teacher after four years of age.
One year later the Sudeten Germans were kidnapped.
Within half an hour the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight car.
This is how judges in the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
The formation of teachers took place in Bamberg.
For this reason, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometres to the next station each week to drive to Bamberg, where three kilometres across the city go to school and when they go back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter received a sleeping space in one of the "Rot-Kreuz-Home" in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 participants in a sleeping room.
In 1951, after three years of apprenticeship, he made the second state of state after three years of apprenticeship.
When he was not free of charge for him, he went to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "milling room" was his first" studio'' in school.
In 1958 he referred to a three-room service apartment in addition to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Up to that point there were three classes and one in Petershausen in Kollbach in the school of Petershausen-Kollbach.
From the school year of 1968 @/@ 69 they were grouped in Petershausen in today's Town Hall.
When the Schulverband Indersdorf was founded, only primary school remained in the place.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the smaller school, the then rector, Georg Sigl, moved to Karlsruhe - while Manfred Richter was his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to draw up today's construction, which was extended in 1997 to be extended in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the senior mayor, Ludwig Götz, who built up a workshop room and the extension of the buildings in 1997, although this was not eligible according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very trained," judge reminded him.
In his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who replied to a lecture from a school on justice and justice: "You must never forget the love," Manfred Richter said what he had heard as a young teacher.
"It is necessary to give the children two things: Roots and wings," says today, 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: "This is not always successful." It is not clear whether he is referring to his pupils or just to his own six children.
In any case, a judge was sometimes unconventional.
When students are being tested, they did not get a penalty from him and have not been beaten in the night.
At the expense of the community, Judge had two pair of boxing gloves and let the two rivals compete against each other, even if there were a number of things to be done.
For the good of the school, judge appointed a good relationship with the then Mayor Ludwig Götz -LRB- CSU -RRB-.
He moved from the party to his party after his retirement in 1996, at least as a last resort on the list of councils for the local council.
But judge was elected at the table and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists are set in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten stopovers.
When Radler will take her tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast, this is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of the final impression was made: The 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour enjoyed a break at the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under open sky in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
Under the motto of "cycling and celebrate on newly discovered trails between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: The cyclists took the first stage, 60 km above Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and more to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of the Mayor of the Mayor, who was in Bad Vilbel with the bicycle, were greeted by the manager of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of the body and mind, all sorts of good things were prepared: The rural women from the city of Ranstcity and the Nieder-Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple -, kennel, street cheese and cheese cake that were wonderfully honed by the skilled cyclists.
"These cakes can only bake land women," they praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while he's another piece of work.
Cold refreshments could be found at the drinks office of the gym.
The "Duo Bravo" stopped the visitors with famous melodies from operettes and musicals and enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
One gentleman also enjoyed a head massage of his partner: "he deserves it, and finally he has already brought together the wheel chains that have already been blown up today." 
In the meantime, the mayor and business manager had to work: They were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking shop of reporters Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Since the first hr4-Radtour in 2004 as the Tour Leader since the first hr4-Radtour in 2004 he was able to buy only briefly, but had plenty to do with the technique on the ground.
His picnic bag, in which he wrote about three phones and a radio device with his staff and sent his staff to the 15-man motorcycle staples of the police of Hessen, he wrote Facebook entries and made reports he also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants came from the Rhine-Main area," he told," also coming from Gießen or Fulda, Lauterbach or the Taunus.
The number of participants depends on the available overnight capacity.
In category I will place the participants in hotels, in category II in collection rooms.
From the spa the cyclists had a good impression when they collapsed after an hour and a half: "Chüss!" 
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" she bowed to leave.
After the arrival in Schotten the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Association of Tourism and Urban Marketing -LRB- GTS -RRB-, the park had a beautiful festive atmosphere and was naturally prepared for delicious, hot and cold cakes with well cooled spring white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS-Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as director of the ADAC Hessen-Thuringia welcomed visitors.
The three were visibly pleased to hear about the "many operations in Scots." 
DJ Tobias Hagen subsequently released the dance stage.
The opportunity for the gay light under the open sky has been diligently used in spite of the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests, there are growing numbers of people who have been attracted by the good mood.
On the second day the stations of Birstein, Guarditersbach and Bad Orb, including a concert with the Trenkwalders, were held on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 km of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish policemen due to "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on account of the suspicion of the "conspiracy against the government," local media agencies report.
The police authorities did not make a direct comment.
Among those who were arrested there are 14 senior police officers who are reporting the latest news on news.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police were arrested because they were founded by organized criminal association and tapped phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -LRB- who was then the Prime Minister -RRB- described its approach as part of the activities that are led by the Islamist clergy in the form of power against him and others in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools opened in Ukraine on Monday -LRB- 1 September -RRB- after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he decided to defend the country for future generations:
The September ceremonies were not held at each school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian national front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, teacher of school in Slawjansk who visited his daughter's daughter, spoke of Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be restored here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in another life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, and the children wear embroidered shirts, hold ballons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets a proud retirement from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tor party.
And it has its own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consultancy company Bain and Co., which changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the head of the mother company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their removal was supposedly almost 1 million pounds.
Their political ranking is also sound.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former Chairman of BP when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: She became a consultant in the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member of the Council.
Already in May, I described the leader's job with a poisoned Kelch.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence acts in two directions: From the first to the first, the first guard of its own identity hierarchy in the BBC, as well as the outside voice of public concern and anxiety when things are wrong.
This provides for an almost unsustainable duopol, which requires full comprehensive reform.
But what new leader would risk standing on everything and raising an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might be involved in his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if this is not enough, many of them are interested to see the BBC - power, money and status.
While the competition is approaching and new technologies threaten old and comfortable collateral, the upcoming negotiation of licence fees is linked to the BBC with special dangers.
For the modest sum of 145.50 £per year, the British public purchases the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: It says that it reaches 96% of households and each of them costs only 40 pence per day.
And it seems that the BBC is rising to the top of popularity: 53% support it today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news on my mobile phone today and I look forward to my iPlayer later.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
It needs a remarkable chairman - I hope it has found it.
Perry of Texas says that lowering Tweet was not authorized.
A Tweet of the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a damning remark about the democratic state prosecutor, who is at the heart of a criminal indictment against him because of misuse of power.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of the other of the Perrys account that rejected the previous one.
A Tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I do not approve the Tweet and have deleted it," he said in the later news.
Employees of Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perrys left official account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavorable picture of the regional prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned in April 2013 due to a decline in the tax.
Perry vetoed a veto of a financial promotion of its office when it refused to resign what could be a charge against Perry - the potentially 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweets is this: "I do not always get drunk with the three-fold alcohol mirror but when I do it, I use Governor Perry when he makes it." 
I am the most comfortable democracy in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the guidance of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry advocates not guilty, and called the indictment a political trick.
His highly technical team of legal counsel applied to the judge who complained about the case, and argued that the law with which the chief governor in the history of the state of Texas was attacked by the chief governor in the history of the state of Texas is unclear in the face of defamation.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government money to the Public Integrity Unit of the State - that is located in Travis County and, in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto gave rise to a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perrys official account is often updated - and is sometimes famous.
After he completed his presidency in Iowa during his presidential election in 2012 when he completed his presidency in 2012, he went on to speculate that he would stop by sending a picture of a photo of a photograph of himself in the vicinity of a lake in the vicinity of a lake, with the words "South Carolina!" 
Berkeley explains the housing market for "normal" 
One of London's most prominent constructors pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England returned to the normal level.
Homehomes in the capital were hot of ambition and are subject to enormous price increases, which led the Bank of England because of the widespread fear of a credit bubble to set limits on mortgage credit in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the Board of Directors of the highly classically construction company, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal levels of transaction levels since the peak of 2013," and added that this is a" stable action environment.''
The property market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Katowice Office, prices in the city alone rose by 18.5% last year, well beyond the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, cheap and student offers increased by about a fifth of last year and reached the 423.000 £of April at the end of April.
But, over the past few months, real estate ownership in London has become less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric to make a possible "Villtax" before the general elections next May.
London's real estate agency, Foxton, warned last week that in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April, in which more stringent lending regulations were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in the sale of real estate and at the prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the property market is cooled.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecasts for the increase in housing prices in London to the bottom of 3% in 2015, on the basis of what is already weak.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has been reduced by a quarter for a quarter of year after year, thus being the broker of WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, because the fixed amounts of futures amount to more than $2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well planned product at the best locations remained stable, and as a result, futures sales have also remained stable." 
In June, the company reported that it sold 3.742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third of the highest level of 2007 before the crisis.
Annual earnings increased by 40 percent each year to €280 million, sales by 18 percent to $1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year is expected to meet current market expectations.
According to the analysts, the annual pre-tax result valued at £450 million.
In the afternoon of the London trade fair, Berkeley shares stood at 23.96 £.
Naked pics of Jennifer Lawrence by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence's appearance at the 85th Oscarber.
Naked photos of the Oscarwinner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of other 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star of "The Tribute of panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were authentic and the hackers complained about" flagrant violation of privacy.''
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
In the first half of the 20th century, the photographs that were originally posted on the photo album site 4chan were supposedly bought by a gap in the online storage system of Apple, with the alleged "master list" of the hacker victims the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Wenger and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported Buzzfeed.
It is not sure how many of the images are authentic, although Walls, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"For those of you who watch photos that my husband and I added to the private environment of our hotel years ago - I hope you are so happy with you," wrote Walls on Twitter.
Victoria Justice of the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and" Viceroy'' said that in the photos of images of her and tweetete "These so-called nutimages of me they are fake, people.
Let's take a look at the beginning of the beginning.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop stars Ariana Grande rejected the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons, a highly acclaimed novel about love and the letter "J." 
They flowed, they could best describe it, they were slowly soldered like a box that is left in the rain.
Occasionally a woman said to him that he is too serious, tiring, intensive, distanced, and perhaps a bit dull.
And shake the hand to him.
He knew how to scratch it.
He was stony, as it was in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this barrage was an just beginning affair that was more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life, and perhaps he would have done some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a treacherous beauty with untold hair and a flattening heart of a village on the North Island that even disappeared and was left to rest was as port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older escort who held Kevern for her aunt, and the plot had inherited a lot of land in a wet but heavenly valley with the true name of Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leck, in the baths there were still spiders, neck necks left their traces on all windows and believed they were all of them, they were all of them, and the garden was monitored by weeds that looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house of a kindergarten, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, his novel "J" on the Longlist for Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
When he came to the end of his life, he was able to make the most of his life when he came to the end of his life.
Your feet are too large.
Because of their aggressive aggression, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was correctly prohibited - simply did not play.
It has been successfully rendered obsolete, so as to make the word obsolete.
The general taste of what you would have done and what rules would never have been done, and how the people of books choose the Vom-Telleretter-zum-Millions memoirs, cookbooks and love romance, they chose the ballads when it comes to music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and played great feet in a grob-comic Serenade.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"It was a famous song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller, he explained it and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done so to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It began as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he told him.
When you make a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a Penny.
It has not been a very funny game at the time and it has not been funny now.
He knew what was expected of him, and that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn has never been one of them.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly prohibited.
The improvisations were no longer modern.
It was only place for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be completely safe at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
It is also the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically pressed mind.
Although he had been 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he did not have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At their age she could not recall a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of group talent - grateful as the fate of fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport because of temperament and body building, that is how they sang and ran them.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent, and were supported with the task to ensure that no family remained without a working phone.
What was still left of the Polish community took care of the cannon; what was left of the Greeks had been broken.
Those of the Gulf states and the Levante whose grandparents had not quickly left the country than what had happened to WAR, EAR said WAR, for fear of being accused of being accused of fire, of fear that the flames of fire were to eat next, and out of fear of the opening of the flames of the flames
Each according to its skills.
As she had only heard ballads, it was difficult to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could be made more expensive.
Music was an expression of love.
"They are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Apart from people whose feet are too large.
My father has never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
He was too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbonated leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father love to love it?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in their presence.
It already thought it was rather strange.
"It appeared to him, he said instead.
She shook her head and he left his head sight.
There was nothing else around the world to see it.
There was nothing he would otherwise have seen.
"When you say," I say it without conviction.
But this does not explain why you are presenting it to me.
It seemed to be honest about it.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again at it.
Your feet so directly do not.
Maybe your ankle, a small bit
And you say you hate me because my ankle is too thick?
You hate?
Of course I do not hate you.
This is just the stupid song.
He could have said `I love you ', but it was still too early.
"Your thick ankle is precisely why you are listening to me," he tried instead.
I am a bit perverse.
This is not true.
It should have been funny.
When he sought to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the comforting charm he needed to tame the cruelty that is inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be Kevern.
In spite of his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was red and rose from their deckchair, the console threw the console and swallowed up the wine she consumed.
It was not an excuse for him, but it was not an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she appeared to tremble, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"and your thick head is precisely why I feel moved to you," she said.
Except that I am not I am not.
They were tired of him, both because of the ingenuity of his words and the fear that appeared in their eyes when they opposed him.
Did she think he would beat it?
It had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as it is here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke down here as it was there on the shore.
The same confused men, with still thicker skin, who died after the end of the WHAT when they had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always prepared to raise the hand against a woman who refused or despised them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown a thick fist if they did not fit in!
They first kneel - the most common used word was used for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the unspeakable love ballades from the console - they stumbled and then beat.
According to Keeping View this was an unnecessary refinement because it was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign of his body.
He rose from the deckchair like an old man.
They also felt, but their grief surprised them.
This was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew about it.
She saw to him how he was born - a man who, like one of the rooms on the upper floor, saw him - a man complaining by something he himself imagined.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general when some raised their hands against them.
One man turned from her to bow his back, ashamed, defeated, without combat spirit - why was it a sight she seemed to know well if she could not remember a single time when she had ever seen it before today's day?
When she was alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
For a number of years before the events that have just been reported, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative body for public sentiment, on a brief lecture on the continuing violence at the low and medium-sized level was working in precisely the areas of the country where their reduction, if not abolishing, would most likely have been expected to be most likely to be
"much has already been done and much has to be done, it" wrote it to appease the innate aggression of a people that has led to a thousand wars and most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness has rarely been felt between the hedges, despite the high intensity of the cherry towers between the hedges
But some features turn out to be indestructible.
The higher the church tower, the lower the passion it continues to awaken.
The population of the population when listening to sentimental ballads is well known to the virtues of marriage and family life, but it is not only the former crude that holds rural communities as well as our urban fabric, it is also evidence of the emergence of a new and misguided dispute at home, in the workplace, on the streets and even in the fields of play.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said he had read the whole report.
I propose that you read less novels.
ESME Nussbaum lowered its head.
I must also ask: Are you Atheist?
"I think I do not need to say this," I do not say," replied ESME Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Once again, ESME recalled its right to privacy and refusal to speak.
Feminist?
Once again, silence is being done.
"I do not ask this," Luther Rabinowitz finally said," because I would be against atheism, lesbian or feminism.
This is a preoccupation of the workplace.
We serve a non-partisan society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves, can occasionally distort the results you have imagined.
You yourself seem to have prejudice against the church, and those things that you call a "silent" and" roh,'' could be interpreted by others as an expression of a spirit of strength and vitality.
If you continue to walk around, WHN ES will do it, as if it were done yesterday, it will mean that if it were done yesterday, it will mean that it will make it essential to the country.
ESME Nussbaum looked at it while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head a LED script in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow gave to the country in the last quarter-century or more.
Smile your neighbor, value your partner, you listen to ballads, visit Musicals, use your phone, use your phone, you speak, you explain, you say, you will listen, you listen, you agree, you agree, I apologize.
Talk is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want," I answered ESME Nussbaum with a calm voice when she was sure she had come to the end of it, and I say nothing other than that we are not as effective as we fool ourselves.
My concern is that without warning we will probably find ourselves in the way we repeat the mistakes that were made at all in the case of the WHAT, that is what I was doing.
This time, however, it is not the others who let us lose our rage and distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed with the hands of a pyramid.
To make it easier, you will notice the time you want to.
"They go too far," he said, "he said," if you call actions as a "error," which our grandparents may have or have not committed.
They go too far when you speak that they have omitted their "rage" and their" distrust'' to "others." 
It should actually not be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past, as with the protection of the present, we do not speak of "us" and" others.''
There was no `'and there was no` other'.
It was a time of disorder, this is all we know.
"When we are honest with ourselves," if we are honest about ourselves, "let ESME throw it out," no part of society can claim to behave well.
I do not blame anyone.
Whether it has been bad or good has been done what has happened.
That was then.
Nothing more needs to be said - we agree on this.
And just as no debt must be assigned, no guilt must be taken; if such deflation would be appropriate, it must not be blamed, and if there were a way to do it, it would be impossible to blame.
But what is the past when we do not learn from it?
The past is used to forget them.
If I may say something about this -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and he dismissed it.
On the next day when they went to work as they used to work, she was left by a motorcycle driver who, as described by passers-by, was in a kind of "brutal rage" at the foot of the walk.
There are cases.
Lesotho-Military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Official officials of the military in Lesotho went out to have planned a coup to overthrow the government and said that they were against police officers who are accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and said that the army of the country opened his seat and occupied government buildings in the capital.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after he had reported attacks.
Military spokesman, Major Ntoi, said that there is no coup in fact, but that the military is responding to the threat of "political fanatics" whose armament is at odds with the police.
"What happened this morning was that the bar of the defence forces of Lesotho, having received several intelligence reports that, within the police, some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the politically motivated young fanatics who were in the middle of devastating damage," he said," he said about Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that military action made the impression of a crash.
"Even if no one has claimed that the government has been torn by violence, all the reports agree that the activities of the defence forces of Lesotho have shown signs of a coup so far," he said.
Spokespersons of the military of Lesotho said on Sunday that the soldiers rushed into their barracks and were calm about the situation in the capital.
In the meantime, the Deputy Mothetjoya metsing takes over governance during Thabanes absence.
Thabane told us that he believed he had become the target of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been great tension since June since June after Thabane parliamentary meetings were suspended because of the dispute in its unity government.
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government in spite of other declarations of intent.
Production in the Eurozone on a 13-month period
The increase in output in the euro zone slowed to the lowest point of the last 13 months in August, with a study that was closely observed.
In August, the final Markit Purchasing Index of the manufacturing plant -LRB- PMI -RRB- fell to 50.7 in August, after a booth of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced breakdowns in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will be held at the meeting of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to find a clear plan for dealing with the eurozone's hesitant recovery, and the threat of deflation by only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could give more information this week, whether it will consider a quantitative easing for the eurozone, in line with those who have been made during the financial crisis by Britain and the United States.
"When a small growth is better than no growth, the slowing effects of increased economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The Fabrik-PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, the second largest economic nation of the block, France, PMI, fell to 46,9.
France remains a custody, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion of stagnation.
References to the fact that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism of Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer effective are also not reassuring," Mr Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the pressure of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland where PMI increased to 57,3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief business expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say to the purchasing manager of manufacturing in the euro zone in August is that the sector continues to grow." 
He added: "producers in the euro zone, obviously seem to find life quite difficult, because the current elevated geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - are increasing uncertainty in the still difficult conditions that continue to grow in many countries.
This increased uncertainty has clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and it is likely that some orders will be delayed or cancelled, especially in large contracts.
He said that it would become more and more likely that the ECB should finally launch a kind of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited." 
The survivor of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school how the children who took part in it are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 of Chechen militias were held hostage in a school in Beslan in the South of Ireland.
More than 330 people, more than half of these children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that the world was shocking.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who have escaped death in the classroom.
Exactly one decade after the appalling siege of the school of Beslan when 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in abhorrence, and surprisingly transformed into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death in the classroom at Greueltat.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell is being traced to them.
Your greatest hope?
The war Ukraine is now looking for - and how they die in the children - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed during an attempt to climb back into the broken school sport hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri and is famous when she tried only in her underwear to climb back into the shimmering school centre after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused after her mother, Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
They were dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me I was supposed to run my life, but I could not," said Aida then.
My legs were overflowing with blood.
I stood up and climbed back to look for my mother.
A soldier brought it to safety.
After a series of operations it stopped to cure completely, but yesterday: "three months ago the pain returned.
I am afraid I have to operate again.
Some grenades are still in my knees.
Your goal is to become a dentist in order to help the people how they have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it has not broken down," it says.
"It happened to me, and that can not be changed
Once a year I will always go to the sport hall to remind me of those who stayed there.
My friends and I will try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too large.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and we dreamed of going to school.
"I do not want to marry, I will not marry my study and I will begin my career.
To a family I think later.
It says that the siege will always stay part of it, although the memory of each year will become somewhat weak.
I am pleased that many people around the world are still reminding us of our horrors, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me I see how I go back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to doing so.
The boy who fled through the ball, in the opinion, his mother is dead.
It was his first school day -LRB- Russians go to school for 7 years -RRB- and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said: "Mama told me that I should sit down when there were an explosion and hold their hand
After an explosion, he thought it would die.
She said to him: `
Full of fear that it could be dead, he escaped and saw on the path of a wine, took it at hand and fled by a ball.
His father, Vladimir, who closed his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I could not rescue it." 
In fact, Tamara was out there in the outside world, and with legacies in the hospital, he assumed that her son had died.
After the reunification she said, she said: `I was pleased to hear about it.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London -LRB- by the now open newspaper News of the World -RRB- in order to win the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is tracking every day, but I wish I could stop by remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will shine in my memory.
I still know that I threw all my toy guns away.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and this is not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children whom I played in the Court and who have not managed outside.
We are never told that they were killed or that they are dead.
We say they are in the sport hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially on the toy shop where I could pick up everything I wanted and the drive in an open car.
But he is afraid of the place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends have suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering me.
"I am so sorry about all those who are suffering from the horrors, Damir worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I would like to help.
I will go to the police one day and I hope they will attend the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, you can imagine this?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers vividly her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London felt when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her Foundation for the prize and was able to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie, and simply say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting you and her husband remember in London, and how the Damir helped me.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borashsch and how she called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant.
And this was just one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British shared our pain and supported us.
She said: `I always think that this world has not become better in these 10 years.
War now continues in Ukraine, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just such children like ours.
I think that for many of the war part of the news they hear when they are bored.
I simply know what these people feel the whole horror.
And I can not stop to feel that
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir was great and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not look for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the last Greueln.
I know he does not like to remember it, but he has six close friends of the class and they occasionally go into the sport hall, igniting candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa bed that he wrote about us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember all his weapons and other military toys, and Damir is now 17, bigger than me, good looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so safe for a couple of hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I saw myself, and saw the hell around me around me, with the body parts that lie everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could not survive.
"I remember I said it to him," Damir, go away," but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But he heard it and he went away.
And so life, unlike many of others, goes further for us.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17
The Young, whose terrible image was after the siege to the symbol of the Greuel of Beslan
Consolation: The Beast of Georgiy Lyin with his mother, Fatima, after the siege of 2004, on the right, an image of Georgij
His bloodthirsty face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life when Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had sold him for his first school day before she rushed to bring her older son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the Court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my small boy there stayed for three terrible days alone," It remembers.
Not entirely, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgiy managed to survive.
The closer this date draws, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it is for a long time, I think it was going to happen yesterday, some scenes from these days to follow me forever.
Nobody will forget this, I promise you.
Insistent: The image of Georgij -LRB- left -RRB- was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalised as a statue -LRB- right -RRB-.
I recall that Georgij wanted to go to school this day; he said he wanted to close his teacher.
I knew he was in life when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the wine-producing Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden in us at home in the bookshelf.
I understand this, but I also understand that the people of the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij now says: "It is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we have ever heard the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies, and they never learn the truth.
And now they investigate the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Are we ever going to know what he has done?
This world is becoming a bit terrible.
"I can not understand how how it is possible, because if you are asking the people, nobody wants a war, what will be done
Ten years is nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a couple of nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid of every day.
I thought to my friends and classmates who were killed.
That is why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st September is approaching.
I want to pay tribute to my old child.
It is difficult for me to go into the sport hall, but I must do it.
I do not feel as a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not paint myself.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visited a medical school in Vladikawkaz.
I will be Herzchirurg.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not leave it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it will not happen.
Georgiy Faniev, 20
The Young who survived when he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorist?
One wonder: Georgij fanatics were trapped during the siege to the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was caught in the sports hall and sat beside the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is a miracle that he has not been killed.
"We feel it was as if it were yesterday," Georgij said that he wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but it could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, it is nothing I have left behind me.
I am now older and people say that children can easily be able to deal with serious experiences - I must say that this is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt I was actually a bit better, but I can not forget it
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - in the year - was the first and the only time I went back to the sport hall.
I lost awareness.
I will never return there to ask me not to show you where I have sat in this famous picture.
Overliving: Georgij Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do not like to speak about it and that they never asked me about the school.
Physically it is a good thing for me.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the Secret Academy of the FSB in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I have also submitted my documents and I have replied that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have already had two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I knew I would never report to my children from my experience.
Children should not know about this, and they should of course not suffer it.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary is approaching.
I will be in memory of the celebrations.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It must be much more intense for him because it was there and I do not.
I waited home to him and could not help.
I am grateful to God for being returned to me; here in Beslan all of them were drawn.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept this when it comes to something less than a fair.
He is a boy, he may be sport, but he can not participate because his knee.
It has operated on several occasions, it can run, but there is no sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50%, but we can never overcome this completely and forget.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbours have been killed during the siege, and this only increases my pain.
I lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make to me, but my heart is crying for the tugs.
I know of families where new children were born, but I also know of jokes who have never been married.
It is hard to accept that life continues, even if we do not want to do so.
I will never forget how my heart jumped to me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
War is now very close to our country and I almost can not believe it
We were once a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and are still being killed.
If we could all attack and go beyond them, we can go as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The Baby that was so worn by a special command command in safety
Save: Aljona Tskajewa is safely brought into security by a Russian special action command -LRB- on the left -RRB-.
It is now 10 -LRB- right -RRB- and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world took breath in 2004 when Baby Aljona was born in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists allowed them to go, but in their cruelty they held their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, at the time of three years, escaped, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan was married since then and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana that he called Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, who is ten years old, is not reminded of the siege and has grown to an intelligent and happy girl, saying neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," say a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and will spare them all the memories that will grow with the tenth anniversary.
They will understand why.
Man accused of passing girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is in front of court because of the slaughter of a 3-year-old girl on a footpath.
Gordon Steward is accused of having driven a girl in East Neuk in East Neuk.
The indictment suggests that Mr Steward has controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and is violating the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, disputed the accusation in front of the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC launched the proceedings for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most economical option is a watertight point And-Shoot like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action-Cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition that are both for about $300.
I recorded these photos on a family firm with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of less than 350.
Regardless of the equipment there are a few rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other subjects are tightly closed.
Add your camera to the photos or videos you want to download.
A number of cameras and cameras are equipped with scenes and recording sessions with which the exposure time is optimized for the surface of the water.
And before you jump into it, you will check until the depth of your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Browse through our shopping guides and reviews of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many will not fold.
Point-and-slot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right image is a matter of luck.
So make a lot of pictures.
When your camera has a string mode with which a set of images with slightly modified exposure settings can be done, you can use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is dramatically worse, the further you will remove from the surface.
If possible, you can stay close to the surface when you are shooting in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This will also allow you to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice to the country, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad lighting conditions.
It is especially important when you are working with an action cam: These devices often have a solid wide-angle lens, which means you need to approach your objects if they want to complete the entire image.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an advisor, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick from both the agony of the disease and the agony of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and diseases when they were treated mostly with something else: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose suffering began.
"I did not feel myself," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulties to raise me.
While he fought with the grim symptoms, he noted that he was impatient about his wife Juliet.
"I would like to know everything as quickly as later," he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt it was quite unusual and not enough to worry about.
Anything stood in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray test of his breast.
Only before two weeks he had been to skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray test was the result.
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an ominous cancer that attacks the chest, which attacks the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer has been smokers earlier.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber material, which was once known as a "miracle material" but has since been recognized as lethal.
For most of us Mesotheliom is a disease that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960" s, when industry has voluntarily committed itself to failing to use it.
In places where it was still used, only people in certain industries were working directly with the substance - plumber, construction workers, carpeting and shipyard workers for example.
As an industrial hazardous material from other time, it seems unlikely to be more worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is now the culmination of a Mesoltheliom-epidemic epidemic.
There are more deaths from Mesotheliom than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice the number of people die from this disease than in the case of road accidents.
Annual figures of Mesotheliomi cases since 1980 and prospective future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are now seeing the deadly effects when asbestos has been illegal for years -LRB- in 1999 -RRB- -LRB- in 1999 all types of asbestos were prohibited -RRB- this is that a Mesotheliom has only been developed after decades.
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not confined to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and often is still, in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And this is why Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial boundaries, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protected area.
The parliamentary buildings are contaminated by asbestos.
The hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogens.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber either.
It was indeed difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks as if in the tunnels of Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years, there was a lot of asbestos." 
All - students, nurses, doctors and Pförtner - using the tunnels.
One wonders how many people will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he could at least answer this question in part.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital, and they were infected with Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010," I am the last to live.''
How many of us will still be ill?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 5.
This was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomas die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease is always lethal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still be ill? '
Britain's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to end in the UK, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be lost.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to whom those affected are often referring to compensation claims, shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioms is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer announced, for example, that Janice Allen had been exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship stores in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years than when she started to work at M & S
Now she has two children in the kennel.
"Before this thing, she says," I have never heard of Mesotheliom, I did not really know anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought that this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the concept of asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name stems from the word `asstform ', a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most frequent found of asbestos in buildings.
It has been used for roof boards, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulation, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other asbestos forms, but it is seen as a "big health risk" by the EU and the WHO as a" big health risk'' with possible death.
It is more dangerous than the brown asbestos -LRB- Amosit -RRB- and the blue asbestos -LRB- Krokydolith -RRB-.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that there is a clear, but indirect, reference to this that this was a key reason for uniquely high trade fairs." 
A staff of Marks & Spencer was located in Oxford Street, London in London.
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical Mesotheliomb victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their history is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of the victims who says that `an essential part of the Mesotheliome, without a known suspension by work or in the House, has probably been caused by asbestos contact in the environment." 
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like nobody can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which investigated the palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service powers and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos behind Parliament's departments with asbestos, whose lethal fibers could be swept away by something as harmless as "strong air movements" .
MEPs are often accused of dealing with their own interests, but here it looks as if it is the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the West Minster Palace received a "clean health certificate" , it is now undisputed that ECU 1 billion must be increased over several years in order to renovate the parliament to modernise electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the general elections, the MEPs will probably meet at the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Godmine report also pointed out that the existence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions." 
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All we can do now is to wait.
One person who has never been able to determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspected that he had been exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively determined," he says," But I can not prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you have worked on and the data.
What he still remembers is the day of the beginning of December 2009, when he got a kind of fever.
He was 45, and just took surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly I had sweat frost.
It suddenly came to pass.
I felt terrible.
I believed that the journey to home would no longer be created.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest hair, the skin was touching around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a Mesotheliom.
He did not work for a month.
Doctors who took an X-ray picture of his chest and put Pleurakathether to take liquids from the lungs and test them in the laboratory. They are also used in the laboratory to test liquid from the lungs.
His complaints, however, remained without a diagnosis.
His health began to improve, and he returned to his work.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after sporty activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011 a patient arrived with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesotheliom.
But also now the Association of Abbott did not deal with this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and worked directly with asbestos.
The link in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened and his vet brought his CT-scans and X-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, when Abbott felt ill for the first time, a camera equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the reef and the chest.
I am an optimist.
I'm usually doing it simply," he says.
To be honest, I did not worry so much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy occurred during the week between the Christmas and the New Year: "It was said to me that it was Mesotheliom." 
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan-nurses, one of whom recommended to take care of a lawyer.
It is only now that it describes the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated from asbestos, he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes of asthma in hospitals were under the earth, so patients were unlikely to be exposed to the substance.
But many of the staff who moved from one building to another -LRB- like Andrew Lawson -RRB- or ate in underground Cantines -LRB- as Graham Abbott often did -RRB- were most likely to be in contact with the toxic substances.
It shows that, over several decades after the war, hospitals for patients may have been life-saving, but are life-threatening for the doctors who are involved.
It is still being removed today.
When they came out of schools, they made their petals in front of us.
And it is not just a question of hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
There are also schools.
In fact, many people have had the first ascension in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemical clients, students have shut down their petals to asbestos mats.
On websites, the issue of asbestos in schools is often raised.
In the meantime, so innocent items in our houses, such as floors or scales of psoriasis, contain asbestos by default.
"It is a industrialist that is included in large parts of our real estate," Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that was taken by a woman concerned was the demolition of a garden mill in the 1970s.
So you can adjust how you will draw your garden.
The impact of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue doing, but I realized that I realized that I could not concentrate on what I did.
I have been in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I was going to take care of myself.
Well, I will not experience another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective from the position of a doctor was one of the patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how to overcome all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to include everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long I have to do it?" 
And there were about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, `Then, I will not experience another Christmas.
That is what it was like." 
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our lifeline mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is absorbed and the fibres are inhaled, they can be fixed in the chest of the skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asthma fibres irritate the chest and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled native asthma fibers," Professor Tom Treasure, a Heart Thorax doctor who moved to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital from which Andrew Lawson suspected that it had exposed him to the asbestos is now ironically, a leading centre of the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asthma reaches the lung tissue, Treasure says it is pressed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From the very beginning it is from the beginning of invasiv.
The usual options for other cancers do not function well in Mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotter.
Some think it is worth a try.
Treasure denies this.
"It is not possible to cut the chest," he says.
They do not come across the knife with the knife.
In the meantime, cancer is not very good in chemotherapy, but it does not heal.
"There are sometimes long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients are in fact living for a long time, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott arrived in contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and advice bureau for those who were involved.
"hello, cancer central," he suggested happily when he was calling.
"It was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years before and has still been very active.
Originally Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, the four months would last and his life would only be extended by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson managed to make things appear in a more positive light." 
After the advice of several physicians, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart -Thorax specialist at the guy's.
"We had an advantage that I did not need to be expelled, I simply called and got a date," he said.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and must wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial to Mesotheliom-sufferers in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments fail to fail, many people face other financial concerns - about the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan von Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that one realized that a very low strain was also a health risk.
And here companies" negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually set their case, but it was not what Morgan called "full compensation" , because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom was due to an asthma contact at Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, a spokesman of the guy confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the cellar area in the 1990s." 
This was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is an enormous problem for Mesotheliom-sufferers who are seeking compensation, an enormous problem that can be associated with fatal ascension of a company or a job - usually for decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that time is for them, but that they are certainly not with the plaintiff.
In response to this, there has been a clear new legislation in this year that makes it easier for trade fairs to claim compensation even if their former employers are no longer available.
The law has established a fund of EUR 350 million supported by the insurance industry for all who were diagnosed after July 2012, has been able to provide a contact, but to ignore none of them.
In these cases, the plaintiff receives 80 percent of what a court could have had in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 £.
About 300 successful applications in the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many trade fairs that 350 million pounds were a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"It is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and it suggests that this is a quarter of what insurers should have to pay if time had not been ignored, and they could find the companies they were dealing with and be able to handle them normally.
Mike Penning, the Minister of Labour, also admitted that the law is not perfect.
But both twing and Morgan have admitted that rapid action is necessary in the face of seven deaths every day.
"People suffer so much and today need help today," said Walking during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December of last year.
At this time Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After its first consultation, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which, unlike Tom Treasure, he was expected to have a positive effect.
This has been accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent with the Lang-Lazdunsky for five years.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This is of course with the most important thing," says Abbott.
This is something we can always see for patients.
There is something you can continue to do.
If you wake up, you will get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott joined the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March 2014.
There were several cancers around my chest.
I have just been 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-threatening.
Again, Abbott withdrew six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is more visible.
But the process is physically and mentally tiring.
You must think of practical things - about money when I am no longer, for example, for example, as my wife will show how the time frame setting works.
When you receive bad news, you will be negative.
They must look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It is difficult for parents," he says.
It is hard to know what you are supposed to say and how much you want.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I would have a disease with which I would not be old.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impenetrable.
She told her friends and we got many calls soon.
Ellie was more restrained.
She did not say much.
Such talks are something that needs to pass through all cancer patients.
But for Mesotheliomill, such talks are not crossed by hope, not by a trace of hope to survival.
The disease -LRB- as is finally true for Stephen Jay Gould -RRB- is a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong the right to government choice, protesters sweating retaliation.
On Sunday, despite the increase in calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach is probably likely to cost the long awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists held the planning and mobilisation of them within a few hours of the announcement.
In principle, the decision of the Chinese National Congress allows the Communist leaders to reject all of the candidates who are not willing to vote.
"It is not unexpected, but it is angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
We have lied to the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice Secretary of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic" .
Since 1997, when Britain withdrew control of Hong Kong, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants of 2017 to choose the seat of government.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong a right to vote, but it is also clear that the decision by the Chinese authorities is that the Chinese leadership retains the process in the hands of a quarterly nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates should be admitted with love of land and love to Hong Kong.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong have taken place for many years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Movement Occupy Central with Love and Peace of which organizers have threatened to lift the financial district if Beijing does not allow a true universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within a few hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-centric supporters in the rain met in the rain of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organisers said that their movement reached a new stage of civil disobedience and that they planned protest in the weeks to come.
But they did not make any more information about this, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organisers agreed that the movement of the central district was only considered as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all of the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and are not a choice.
We are tired of having to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for the announcement of Beijing for days, and there were stricter security measures on Sunday before the government building, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The entry of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Moreover, the fear that Hong Kong's values will begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing is growing.
Some criticised the Occupy-Central-Movement demonstrations because they threaten business operations - the life of Hong Kong.
"The protests of which they speak could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they continue to go," said legal expert Regine Ip who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want to stir up fears that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media recently reported about the pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong as a subversive agent controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists have an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 78,000 people took part - more than one-fifth of the electorate in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the greatest democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school leavers in the USA is now transferred to the universities where they are offered private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to react to this demand and to offer Britain's first luxury travel service to students of today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport prices such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
He also admitted that the service saved security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to catch up with the land in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that no new bookings were made because the service had just been introduced, but it added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks." 
The company also announced that, despite the tuition fees of EUR 9,000 per year, it would expect a market for this offer.
Students today differ from students in their expectations and from the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do so.
The National Students Association criticised the service as it did.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems to be completely separated from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month with their studies will see a crisis of living costs because the financial resources available in the form of loans and grants do not stick with the highly increased invoices for the easiest way of life before they can think at all about spending thousands of pounds on something as much as the arrival at the student residence.
Feminists criticise racial issues and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants raised their hands into the air and sang, "hands high, not shoot" while they were waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussion of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators place gender in front of the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequality.
While tensions in the Middle East increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that white women responded to 100% of the race.
In comparison with the answers given by black women on 9 August, the personal essays with titles like "ideas on Ferguson by a white woman" and" feminism, does not only revolve around the oppression of women'' relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I do not believe that in feminism there are many people who speak about the white, and privilege speak in so high a way," they said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are facing and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnically that it must express this.
For English professor Coritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson revealed problems that black American women are exposed to every day, but who are not perceived as "women's" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and I get 150 Likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
When I say something about how Farms stand under siege in their own country, silence is stunned.
"How can it be safe for women to speak openly on a relationship, but not on security in the public space?" 
For black women such as Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the issues; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women are now connecting the subjects of race and gender to the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors have done the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were beaten and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman, "said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynchkilling.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white fighters analyzed the country in late 19th century for women's election rights as Susan B. Anthony analyzed in the late 19th century, and found that the fight for the right to vote could only be successful for each group: Women or black.
"They took the decision to make use of the rights of women, and the right to vote in favour of black should come later," said Hattery.
When one remembers such things, one understands with power why white women do not trust white women.
We have not done our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade before white women were organized against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was born almost 40 years after the original request for help from pages of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of time in which white feminists played with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"It is not great when the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to educate a child as seriously as they do about the right to contraception," Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation who built their career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means are now trying to understand what this means.
The well known white feminist activist Gloria Stein went to Facebook after two weeks after Michael Brown's release and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, the columnist of the Guardian, in which she called for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another, but parallel reason to understand a danger that is inherent to the body - and opinions on the race that are very different from public surveys will make the changes," Stein wrote.
Although Stone is in favour of a more intersectional feminism where racial and gender issues are being addressed, some of their comments on the issue of racial issues in America are puzzled.
Christina Sommer, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole feminism?" She said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young coloured men, are more vulnerable than their sisters,'' he says," but Steinems's remarks on Ferguson are in contrast to their earlier critique.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing is for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions by many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is at the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the US Border Police has taken up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform will also come to the surface of the surface - this time as a women's area.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilized women for the reform of immigration, said that, for a new view of the subject, it must only publish the stories of immigrant women as an essential part of this.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of labour visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a follow-up to the women's organisations," they said.
"pig house" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house available for sale was removed from real estate brokers when it became clear that it showed a large sponge that made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is situated on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 €.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - also belonged to one that belonged to his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig on the photo is the pet of the owner.
"The photo was released in error and has since been removed" said a speaker of the company.
In the description of the house, Connells described the previous collection as a "unique one-family house with one bedroom." 
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it will still appear on advertising material.
The sale of domestic products caused interest in the social media when some people asked if the pig had been included in the purchase price.
The SWCity Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lottowin.
A lottery player from Harvey is this month
The search for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth will last with a happy winner who receives almost 1.1 million dollars from the lottery on Saturday.
For the second time in five years, a newspaper kiosk in Harvey drew the jackpot in the draw of the first division, after 1 million dollars in November 2009.
The lucky winner must still report.
The shop owner, Steve Forward, said that the profit for talking is in the small town in the south west of Perth.
The city is talking about anything else and everyone is quite excited.
We thought this could happen.
Eight WA-winners won prizes last month in the first division, a reasonable conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont reached the megaprofit of $7.5 million a few weeks ago.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and he said they would give them the opportunity to travel around the world and to buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the Gladiator Arena
Not only the gladiators in Matsch stood in the park at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors to yesterday who defaulted at the rainbow and made their way out of the historical spectacle.
There were a colourful range of images, shows, games, exhibitions, and information about the time of the Romans and their meaning for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighters of the gladiator "Amor Mortis," who used every rainbow to demonstrate their robust combat art in the arena that was prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" turned out to be humorous and knowledgeable, and sent his men in the ring to the heroic two-fight in various gladiators.
First of all, the "Provocators" were on the right arm on the row of the right arm and the leg on the left leg.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short shears and petals, along with iron rod helmet, bass and arm protection.
In particular, the appearance of the "Retiro" that entered the" Secutor,'' and recently fought against the "Secutor" was also extremely impressive.
When it came to power to meet the swords of metal, the shields and the petals floated through the arena that a fear and bange could be the health of gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis," the muskulous referee, had an always attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and to make the culture of Roman life a reality," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the" Friends of the Roman Canal'', the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation time, the park was built for a day of "Oppidum Roman," a Roman city, such as Vice President of Claus, who said he was listening to his greeting word.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and many buildings that we still admire today.
The remains of this were also seen during the Roman day, such as "aqua mineral marble" of the 11m high and 1400 m long Roman canal bridge that was once part of the ventilation.
The Frontinus society once and now faced the supply of water and energy, and business leader Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of then." 
This is also confirmed by the degree of degree of degree of degree from the engineering team of "Engineering Team Two" from Rheinbach to the measurement tools of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypothruster, the hot air conditioning that was once the Roman villa.
It is also impressive to see the footprints that were left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the office for the conservation of soil had been excavated at the Landesverband Rheinland the remains of a Roman villa in the industrial park of Nord in Rheinbach.
It has been found in an economic building with a darre for the drying of grain and mice.
The building is likely to belong to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate that has been described by the Archaeological Institute of Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first century to the end of the century, until the beginning of the Germanic people in the then Roman Rhineland.
In the course of their work, the children were involved in the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or have written their names with metal handles on wax boards as they used to be Roman students.
At the stand of the Roman thermen of Zülpich the children were allowed to set up mosaics themselves, at the stand of the glass museum of Rheinbach glass mosaics, and to use a heavy wheat mill from stone at the stand of the Nature Centre of Eifel Nettersheim to make the flour for a barge or a muesli.
In the summer of 2009, the hotel opened its doors for the first time in the summer of 2009, making it one of the most spectacular locations in the world.
With a Roman Week from 13th to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also take place in the Rhine region of 2014 that will remind us of the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and historical societies, as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Association Association and the Association of Secrets of Oberbachem, thematic hikes, lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours of school classes will be offered to school classes and remembered by the Roman history of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionaire from his work on his work on the conditional Wachtberg will present plants as a living thinker from the Roman era and offer a funny lesson in the field of international understanding between a group of leaders of the "Germania" and the Romans to join the Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme in the context of a project day.
By the time of the Roman Week, the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are often visible at the first sight of the Romans.
In the Wachtberger Town Hall, a small presentation to the fund of the Bercumer Matronenheiligalism will remind you in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic of Western Africa
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go to distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rotates in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has placed the region hard.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," is the leader of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest hit
"It is a total disaster that we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
The market only comes from who wants to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia is hit hardest by the virus; alone, the fever has been the victim of more than 600 people.
Recently, the health authorities stated that the disease had come into line with each corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died; thousands of others stuck in.
Foreign companies attract employees
Companies operate their operations everywhere in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also reacting: Few merchants are still leaving their homes in order to recover their supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia that are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export are being wiped out in the fields.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is short
"People are getting less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.
The man for example who normally passes on the market and sells his vegetables is better at home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: Food is scarce.
In the markets, supplies of basic foodstuffs such as rice are disappearing.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, threatens an image store - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies avoid the area over a long period of time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
It is crucial how far the virus will spread and how long the virus will spread.
Investors can feel that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia," Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the strained state budgets of the Member States
The disease also burdens the already strained state budgets of the states concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily stretched by high spending on the health system and in addition to the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million -LRB- EUR 45 million -RRB-.
The impact is also evident in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the Southern Niger Delta has not so far been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home from fear of contagion.
Also reservations in hotels go sharply.
Celebrating its 50th Anniversary
The patron of the "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12th to 14th September.
Preparations for the 50 years of the foundation run from 12th to 14th of September.
It is planned on Friday, September 12, a great entertainment night with the group "Dorfrocker." 
On Saturday you will be able to shoot a large cup of Bon at 6 p.m. on Saturday.
In the summer of the evening there will also be the "Stoapworms" that will be held in the big party of the evening.
Brass band Comes to the Music
Highlights on Sunday are in the parish church and at 2 p.m. in the parish church.
In the afternoon there is also the price of the price of the Federal and Gauge.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 permanent dampers with their dirndln.
The chapel of the castle is the castle chapel of Berngau.
The patronage has taken over the Mayor of Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
Founded in 1907, the original name of the "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" was founded in 1907 when on 21 March the association was founded on" social entertainment by means of an exercise in the safety of the room.
In 1937, the Nazi regime led to the dissolution of the association.
Only in 1964 there were 19 young men again, who rose from baptism on 30th April at the inn of Luke on the 30th of April.
Karl of March and Adolf Ried led the club as a champion of a difficult initial time in which it was mainly intended to find a club and to install the shooting operation.
In the summer of 1965, the manager of the "Leininger" started with two teams in the lap competitions.
In the following years, the sports protection, which was meanwhile organized in seven teams, became part of all classes up to the 1st Gausztyn.
For the first time in 1980, the clubs of the Association of the Association of the Association were reached by Rudi Meier for the first time in 1980.
As the efficiency of the active guard increased, the number of members has also been positively developed.
When the club "Leininger" is no longer enough to meet the demands of a modern protectorate, the executive board under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future residence in the cellar rooms of the new" Landgasthof Härteis.''
After an activity of 2700 hours, the parish of the church gave the church blessing to the church on 8 May 1988.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaushot, coupled with the solemn funeral of the new traitor in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary of the foundation.
In 1995, a fan group was founded.
Josef Fernzl was a member of Böllerreferent.
A great challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böll meeting in 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work, the members of the club last year modernized the rooms and the firing plant in the Berngau court and thus brought up the latest state of technology.
Eleven teams in Round Futures
It is also possible to see the sporting performance of the Foundation.
In total, eleven teams are currently participating in the rounds of race: Six air guns, an air gun team, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi degrees and Kerstin Keller mann rose to the rank of 1 in the round of 2013 @/@ 14 by the Warsaw League -LRB- the highest league in the Schützengau ANB -RRB-.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml rose to the Gautage League by the Gaukreis Nord.
In addition to the shooting, events such as buckets, carnival and royal ball have a tradition of celebration.
With this, the guards are also at festivals in parish and community.

Looking for Young Friends
Easy to try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Director Lisa Neitzel -LRB- left -RRB-.
Like many other clubs, the jazz bands in the TV Jahn of the full day classes will be created at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, a number of groups have been severely decimated.
Now we are looking for new players for a sport that is healthy and that is great fun.
In the two jazz and modernist groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits," only nine children are children.
"Three in the group of 8 to 12 years of age, 6 in the group of the Twelve to 15-year-olds," the 20-year-old says.
With more acrobatics, it would make it much more enjoyable, "you could dance about other choreographies," she says.
For those who want to dance, Thursdays from 17 to 18 p.m. or Fridays from 17 to 6.30 p.m. in the dance sport of the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, can be taken into the course of the course.
"The training regularly begins with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
After that, different choreographies will be practiced.
Jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no defined form, and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore from classical to sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, conviviality is not too short.
"We also eat dinner, we look at dance films and we've stayed in the dancing room too," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and still do a lot for their own motor development.

NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia as a result of the planned operations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukrainian crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels, NATO is in line with the founding agreement of the NATO Council of NATO in 1997.
But the NATO boss accused Russia of "a stark defeat" of the agreement.
"Today, we must look at the reality of the fact that Russia does not consider NATO to be a partner," Rasmussen.
Documents and opinions from the Russian side indicate that they consider us as enemies." 
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that we want to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" at the NATO summit in Wales will make sure that" we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is needed,'' Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow Take a look at new gas talks
According to official information, Russia and Ukraine agreed to new talks on the settlement of their gas strike.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision by the European Union whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has no longer had a fuel from Russia for weeks.
Finally, EU energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supplies for Europe.
Europe accounts for about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, of which a large part is flowing through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks to power: Tolls will be "clear" 
Now the Chancellor is still fully committed to this.
It is not a licence for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the toll on cars have made the CSU wake up.
After persistent opposition from its CDU, German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of a power word for the introduction of a car toll.
"To make it quite clear: It is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party leader on Monday said at meetings of the CDU leaders in Berlin.
But, for the time being, Merkel failed to make a detailed model.
In the black-and-red government program, "certain parameters" are called.
German Minister Alexander Dobrindt -LRB- CSU -RRB- made a proposal, and work is being done now." 
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its no for a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Chancellor Wolfgang Schäuble -LRB- CDU -RRB- was also constructively involved in the debate on a draft law.
In addition to the topic, Dobrindt also talked about other ways of enabling more private capital investment in infrastructure, including broadband.
"There is nothing special about this," Schäuble left a" mirror'' on Sunday without comment, his house validates his own concept to pay highway investors with toll revenue - after the election of 2017.
CSU CEO Horst Seehofer warned against developing in the cabinet toll concepts against the lead minister.
The Confederal Group of the European Radical Alliance confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement has never been based on all kinds of tunnels and federal roads," said the North-East Westphalia.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that we should talk about the subject again.
Resistance to the plans is also due to the CDULand federations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is that a toll is affecting small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had called for the toll of pressure from the ranks of the CDU coalition.
The Left sees the plan as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the" New Works'' newspaper -LRB- Monday -RRB-.
"The toll is failing by the Minister," Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads that will start in 2016.
According to the association agreement, domestic car owners must not be burdened with additional charges.
That is why they are supposed to receive a full compensation for the toll on the car tax.
However, the model must not penalise foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder is often false
One British says she thought as a result of misdiagnosis for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived in the belief that she had only a few years to live in the belief that she had been diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease -LRB- CMT -RRB- - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnosis is a frequent problem for people with CMT because so little information is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders, such as muscle weakness, an insecure and curved side.
The disease is incurable and progressive, and this means that the symptoms are getting worse at the time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she would suffer from Friedreich-Ataxie -LRB- FA -RRB- - a disease with very poor survival chances.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she would be 18, and she died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old, said: `As a child, I knew I could not do the same as the others.
I fell constantly and everything took me longer.
I could never ride with the other children roller shoe or skateboard and I was often dressed in school because of my way to walk and run.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations for discharge, she saw her feet and his feet of her feet when her doctor had left the room and she read that she was suffering from IAs.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I did not tell it to anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the Library, and wrote to the FA-society," she said.
When I was given the answer, I was shocked and were panicked.
I thought I would be with 18 in the wheelchair and die with 25, and in the middle all my abilities would be lost.
I made all of this with me and I was going to make my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, became aware that her skills had not decreased so much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He simply stood on, and hug me and called "my love, I do not believe that you have that, otherwise you will already be already in the wheelchair." 
I think you have something a bit less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests the CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt I felt as if I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Aware month in order to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfieldwebel a. D. Berni Diether works since the closure of the former troop of troops as fireman.
For almost ten years now, the former troop position in Münsingen has no longer been shot.
In spite of this, every month of dead ammunition will appear at the heart of the Biosphere Reserve of Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be blown up on the spot.
A deafening knee glides over the heart of the biosphere when it comes to explosives.
In December of 2004, the last sharp shot on the Battle of Münsingen that was closed after 110 years of military operations at the end of 2005 was shot.
Since this time the 6500 hectares of grounds are the core of the Biosphere Reserve of Swabian Alb, which is open to 13 designated trails for hikers and cyclists.
The tax burden of businessmen in the area of Washington increases with economic recovery
Recovering the economy will mean more clients, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State-owned and regional tax ministers for businesses in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, a newly published study last week, and firms in the area of Washington did not form an exception.
In the area of District, Maryland, and Virginia, $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the fiscal year of 2013, a 3.8% increase compared to the revenue of 2012, totalled $26.6 billion.
The state-owned and local tax burden of the company rose by 4.1% last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9% per year, and it was the third growth year in succession after the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes increased more than the local levies, accounting for 4.1%, so that the study that was carried out by Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation was carried out by the Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation.
More than half of District tax revenue from corporate taxes comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of its revenue comes from companies.
By 28 percent, Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from businesses.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is based on a recovery of companies" property values, researchers say that increasing real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years of growth, they led to a growth rate of less than 1%.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it also seems to be meeting in Washington.
Companies in District, Maryland, and Virginia paid out over USD 10 billion of state-owned and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of a year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery of property values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and domestic tax revenue, as property taxes amount to less than one fifth of the tax decisions of businesses.
Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state-owned and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland: A large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around DC, is either in the possession of the government or of non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes, Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation said.
For example, Maryland is forced to rely on income taxes, for example, in order to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery of tax revenue by business can not be alone achieved by the recovery of the property market
Corporate revenues seem to recover, they seem to have the data.
Companies in the region reported on income taxes from state organizations of $2.3 billion in comparison to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland accounted for $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is heading in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not rise equally in all three places.
The rise rate in the district was equivalent to 4.3% of the national average while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher than 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a secondary tax rate of 4.1 percent.
By 6 percent in all three areas, Virginia has far less corporate income taxes -LRB- all three have fixed corporate rates -RRB-.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is at 8.25 percent and in the district of relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower state and local taxes in Virginia are required and a better fiscal climate prevails than in Maryland.
In the study the district was not investigated.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has adopted legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5% next year.
When the state continues to achieve its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's income tax rate to 2017 to 3%.
In the meantime, it seems that small businesses in the area of Washington seem to go better, and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes, in other words the most recent study.
Corporate taxes that are paid as personal income taxes by small businesses - a transitional structure after which most small businesses are organized - in District, Maryland, and Virginia rose by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes throughout the country will probably continue in this year, with an increase in overall value-added tax revenues for the state and the local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the area of Washington could lag behind if the government's spending cuts impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German beer for Guangzhou
Hop and Malz - also in China is a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's sister city in China is now looking for a brewery and is also hoping for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's sister city of Guangzhou - is the appeal of officials in China.
"We would be delighted if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said vice Secretary of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD-delegation in his city.
Time and again, the functioning of the ruling Communist Party of China came back to this concern of the twelve-million metropolis during the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, which is also called canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
That is why people also liked the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD-Chairman Thorsten SchählGümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would listen to Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"For beer it does not need much: Good water, grain and joy" , he added lunch to the party upper in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he will put the host to the host.
As a result, the function from Guangzhou came from Guangzhou to SchählGümbel - with red wine that was served at dinner.
The Chinese brand of Tsingstra goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to German purity.
More business
A second request from the Chinese host would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice President Li said.
Lufthansa had offered the flight in the past, but in 2012 it was cancelled for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician convinced himself.
"Trade between our two cities continues to grow." 
Currently, travellers would have to take the detachment of Changsha in the province of Hunan.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, stressed this wish when he spoke to the Social Democrats.
"It is a very good idea," said Schäfer Gümbel - Chinese Vice President Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany who is nicknamed.
Excellent partnership
The empty president of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to attend a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but still not in this function.
He came to office this year after his predecessor was promoted to office on charges of corruption.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration that is being harshly enforced by Xi's Head of State.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked in front of his party career for an American company, which is extremely unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before he took office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top manager in Fujian, where the car VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 km from Guangzhou is one of those who are cared for by both sides, for example with a student exchange of students.
Last year the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis of pearl is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen with its economic power.
Next year it wanted to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, Li reported.
The Family of Joan Rivers
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since their delivery to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter is now hopeful that the 81-year-old will recover from his illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We press all the thumbs.
Her mother was born on Thursday after an emergency due to the rush of heart in a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville endoscopy, in the Mount Sinai hospital.
The doctors consider them to be deliberate and subject to accurate observation until they are content with their state of content that continues to be described as `serious'.
The reactions came from many pages, including in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and dams that are going to go to trade today, more stringent environmental standards will apply in the future.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from September 1st get a label on which the buyer can see at a glance of central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, in the category of pollutants of "Euro 6" there are stricter types of nitrogen oxides.
In addition, there is more money to be spent on the clergy: They receive a single minimum wage of EUR 10.25 per country.
Amazon buys Ttraction for $1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed what information had been reported on Monday morning: The online retailer and video producer, and a lot of other things - buys the video streaming service Tnavigation for $1.04 billion -LRB- $970 million -RRB-.
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because nobody expected a takeover of Tnavigation, but because it was widely assumed that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of TB to the video service of Google was made by Google for a cool billion, and cooperation appeared of course.
Tess, who was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their Bravourpieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The Twitter interface.
And "let's play play," a video genre in which better know the -LRB- usually the older -RRB- games of a paint of intelligence theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just so that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Tnavigation, so the news that wanted to buy YouTube was added to something bored, a textbook example of an established technology that buys a potential competitor.
It is a puzzle why the deal with YouTube did not happen, because the company reports it was prepared to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about this at the moment is this statement by Emmet shear, President of Tnavigation: "We chose for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there more quickly." 
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Tnavigation.
For snobs like me who say they would like to see sport as they do, it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes that others will watch the control panel in the hands of others.
It is a thing to look at a friend at 3 p.m. on the shoulder, while she is light by Resident Evil, and something quite different to see a spy when he is shot 20 times in Call of Duty.
You could just see all of these games now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games of today are Ego games, so without their own control over the eye perspective they can be a good recipe for headache.
I admit that the quick runs in which the Roger Banners of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as it is not a game or humorvirtuosis, his Twitter channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know about this?
Tnavigation is called 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It is hard to imagine that Tnavigation is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video, which would have been easy to swallow.
But Tnavigation has something each company would like: Thousands of young men who are being recruited as advertisers.
As the chairperson of Tnavigate, shear, said, Amazon and the Tone believe in the future of gaming," and the medium does not show signs of a shrinkage, no more.
At the castle of the castle of Burgundy there were a lot less on Saturday.
The concept of the organisers agreed.
In spite of the strong rain on Saturday night there were an estimated 1200 music fans for the open-air test in the castle garden.
At times the admission had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and Fun.
Out of two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name of Amula.
For the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten it is necessary to radiate brightness from day to day through a range of shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone.
This was already evident at the early morning when the first visitors came to the Open Air.
A party for all the generations had promised the organisers.
And they have succeeded in doing so.
Around the castle gardens there were Salzwedelers, but also guests from the closer and other surroundings.
They followed the first live performances that went to the foot of the clock, and cool drinks were short: Pure relaxation and enjoyment were needed.
And it is across the generations.
While some of them are lying on the beach bar in front of the beach, others are in a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, and the number of guests at the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But also in the case of children's mints, the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had all the hands fully done to become the Andorian and to make imaginative creations in the small faces.
The bigger used the Kickertables or took part in a skateboard workshop that brought out the Goodfoot-crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he raced to the visitors, especially families sought the space and dried up.
But the attraction of the festival did not detract from this.
"It came to more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a" success on the whole line.''
This is why there is nothing contrary to a repeat of the big party next year.
Although work still needs to be done in the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear at a first record on Sunday in front of the popular vote.
When he told him that he had to be stopped in the meantime, he said.
Obviously the security company had been booked with too little power.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come across the terrain.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler spoke the co-organizer of about 1200 visitors who tumbled in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-hop band broke his appearance, so his appearance broke out.
The engineers were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned Shishal lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tyre cup.
"next year they will be there," the organisers will be.
The premiere of the Amula-Open Airs was successful by the number of visitors.
And that is the case of bad weather.
However, the organisers have made a number of mistakes that will be lost during the first time but that must be eliminated during the second edition.
In the social network of Facebook, the organisers will also have to face criticism.
"sorry, but for 12 euros one has just been expected," Melanie Meier explains on the event page.
"You have unfortunately taken up a bit of you," says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it is very good that some are not just stupid, but that they really try to put things on their feet.
Hat die!," Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.
Now the organisers will have a year of time to put a stop to these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's emblem
This is not the way it is expected.
In fact, the included part is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation radar Tira is completely renewed.
With a diameter of 47.5 meters, the new radom will be slightly smaller than the old one.
But the size still remains world record.
The final step towards completion of the new shell is the Kappentash
The upper part of the old shell is separated and taken with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell will be set up.
If the weather is involved, the action will take place at the beginning of this week.
Participating in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain so screwed when their icy water was cast over the head that they injured the bone structure of their face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge went painful.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had so much interest in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that it gave rise to the pine.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK so very much created when its icy water was cast over the head that they violated their face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I do, my jaw remained simple," she said to The mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but this did not go, the pine was lost, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister also saw this and made a smile almost in the pants, but I had to get into the emergency.
The 20-year-old from the UK was sent to the hospital to allow the jaw to revive himself after his participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an internet sensation and thousands of pages on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the groups of Burgundy going to join forces again?
Last but not least, there has been a succession between the Wolfratshauser Burgundy.
Now there is much more to be done about the possibility of cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Castle of Burgundy, introduced the project in the French Guédelon.
Just a year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the castle of Burgundy.
Up to now, the positions we have seen so far seem to have dealt with the history of the Wolfratshauser Burg and possible reconstruction.
The two camps are now moving: Soon there will be talks about common action.
This is confirmed by the members of the Board of Directors of Torsten Sjöberg -LRB- Burgverein -RRB- and Herbert Piffl -LRB- Burgundy -RRB- on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and I suggested that we could sit down once," says Sjöberg.
It seems to me that all members of both clubs could again pull together in the future.
This is how visible success can be achieved.
While the castles of the castle were in the middle of the castle, the castle of the castle of Sjöberg is at the forefront of the town of Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, Head of the Castle of Burgundy, was happy to hear his own information about the call.
Since the death of Dimal Death he is standing in front of the castle.
A new chairman will be found in a general meeting in the middle of September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club is currently about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend, Richard Dimbath, we have been able to rest the club activities out of respect." This" thinking'' was necessary to "consider how it could continue." 
According to Piffl the new chairperson will meet with the Burgverein.
Up to that point, the castle friends could also make a current mood picture within their group.
There is still no candidate for the presidency, Piffl says.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself," he himself does not want to stand because he is residing in Bad Tölz.
The new chairperson should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to contribute to the project
The different points of view of reconstruction will probably continue in the near future.
He appreciates Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Due to a high level of participation by the population and volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also sceptical about it at the beginning.
But, over time, I have come to the conclusion that it makes sense to push the project forward," it could be created for the city of Buda.
Otherwise there is nothing to be done here.
Moreover, the project would be financed by EU support, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes it is.
"I do n't just want to take the idea of reconstruction simply on board," he hopes that the Burgverein will perhaps make a difference on this point.
Their goal of documenting history is important and good.
After that it is possible to look at it.
A clever way of saving on Unix books
As the cost of Unix books for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the presidency of the Fast-branch of Matt Schröder rushed into a clever austerity.
He invented a rental system for books of students of higher semesters and offered nominal compensation in order to delay the resale.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19 who visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He gave a total of $120.
The division informed that students spend an average of more than 1,200 dollars a year on textbooks and on studies that students would have a range of cost control options.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice of students.
The rental of textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book a semester often at a much lower price than when they buy.
Neebo Inc, which runs more than 250 university bookshops, announced that the lease of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about one quarter of the books in the College-bookstores were rented in the last spring spring, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of textbooks are purchased according to the National Association of College Store in Campus-bookstores.
Here is the single one for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only one third of the price for which they are in the camping book.
The ninth edition of "Recognition" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but it is possible to refer to the specialized teacher Chegg.com for 239.99 $.
Buy
If one of the notes of other or normal usage tracks is nothing, used books are a good option.
"It is necessary to have on Chegg.com for $93,49.
Matt Casaday, 25, Master student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent 42 Cents on Amazon.com 42 Cents for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decision: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business." 
The book was sold for $48.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, Director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether earlier editions were admissible.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Except Chegg and Amazon, eBay from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting out
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, they think they want to return them and you do not want to keep the books after the end of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Compus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the regulations of the business you rent, also about the penalties that may result in the writing of notes, subsections or usage tracks.
Tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books as well as traditional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a particular period of wholesalers like Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "with you" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best offers because many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, when scientific and professional textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, let us look at it.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the listing of books for the price of books because it is so safe to find the right book.
And before placing an online order, you should check whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and paid the full price in the collage book.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" did not receive a cash register.
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of USD 90 million in the United States, while" Sin City: A lady to Kill For'' just $12 million of his budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" that is tailored to Cameron Diaz played just $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films are also disappointing when it comes to revenue.
An article of the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality could be the reason for children's films of the lack of quality.
In 2014, Collin called "the worst year" for children's films, and thus described" Dragon troops easily make 2'' as purely "functional" fantasy.
In the case of films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly presented the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film launch that was shown between U.S. Memorial Day and July 20, 2013.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on the jungle film film that will soon appear in the jungle, said to the website Hollywood Reporter: "I believe the times change." 
We have to accept this and we must not try to recover the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash performance of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated revenues of $1.2 billion of streaming content - almost twice as much as last year in which sales amounted to $837 million.
During the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for concentrating on comic comics and predicting a "core melting" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current slowdown, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy could well contain a true core.
In the summer of 2015, Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World are other representatives of the film industry, but other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline of the cash flow recently as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporters:" The next summer will be the biggest summer of the cinema, and nobody will worry about business.''
When a couple of years ago, the second table of table tennis was cancelled in order to tighten the league division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German table tennis club has been included in the programme.
The result is that anyone who has not increased has gone down.
For example, the name of the name of the name of God is the most important aspect of the game, but it is still true that it is still true that it is still true, and it is one of the most famous in the world.
Fourth of all, Torpedos ladies remain in the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Dutch league, as do the boys of the SC Weende.
SG Lenglers and the TorpedoReserve enter the new Association of Representatives in which the National League is no longer represented.
The TTV Geismar plays the role of TTV Geismar in the Association of Representatives, which is the Torpedo-second in the National League.
What the composition looks like a better location, now is the new district of the district.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Booming SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district league, as a regional representative of Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of the TTC II, Rot-white, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III The Board of Directors of the ladies will start at least in the shape of the ranking.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the game.
In the district league, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen @/@ Wöllstedt run up.
With a set of nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district of the SCW boys - where Torpedo II still starts - is not complete.
In a county class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded RegionsAssociation, the two of them will start with nine teams.
In the west season the Rot-white II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV, V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengner II
In the East-season there are Sattenhausen @/@ Wöllgraben breaks, Nikolausberg and Landgolfshausen.
The Damen County League consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllgraben ausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of Easter, but there is no more football teams at the district level.
What is striking is that none of the six 2.-circle classes is reached in the direction of the end of time, as the innovative and switchable circle will once have to think about it.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds of hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered to an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people in Cardiff met in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough talked to us about developments at the weekend, talking to demonstrators who went to Belgium from Bridgent.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains
Two teenage Buschwanders were brought into safety with the cable car after they were caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke in Govett Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday noon.
Worried relatives called the police at about 20 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search manager from the local police and rescue services broke out and the couple was found at about 23: 00 in the vicinity of the Veil Waterfalls.
The girl fell in his knees and the man was overthrown and had beaten his head.
Rescue forces stayed overnight at the couple, and they were flown on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable condition with a ambulance in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
Some 1000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, the Minister of Information Security said Pervaiz Rashid.
After half an hour, the transmitter resumed the broadcast.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged equipment in the editorial.
Deaths or injuries were not reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the Heads of Government who accuse them of electoral fraud.
The police told us that approximately one mile from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif came back to the clashes of some 3000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
After hospital information, a policeman has been injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when protesters tried to invade Sharifs residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military called for a political settlement of the conflict on Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters to waste time and use it without force." 
It was said in the communication: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state." 
The escalation of violence has fuelled concerns about intervention by the military, which, in the past, has been more often used in the past.
Protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Premal Tahirul Qaddafi have taken place on 14 August since Independence Day.
Sharif rejects a withdrawal.
Khan and Qaddafi had called on their supporters on Sunday to resist.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qaddafi spoke similarly.
Khan discards Sharif, who won parliamentary elections in May of last year through fraud.
Qaddafi is calling for the resignation of Central and the provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and launch new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the government quarter.
The protesters were initially peacefully starved to Parliament until Khan and Qaddafi called upon them at the weekend to invade Sharifs residence.
After two days of season, Hridorfer will compete with three of the table.
With the 2: 0 on Val Gardena, a conciliatory end has been brought to the end of a bitter week on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberated," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate head in the Europa League on Thursday.
"It was extremely important to experience success," confirmed captain and Torguare Steffen Hofmann, who came across three with Green White.
Schrammel-Dream tor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid with the second season victory, the right response to the disappointment of Helsinki has been demonstrated and is going to make a success of success in the country play slot.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leader from the Sixties in the 14th Minute, put the course to victory.
"I thought I was listening to all the frustration of Thursday, and I did it under the bar," said the 26-year-old smile.
When Schrammel met in a Bundesligapartie last time in a Bundesligapartie, this was still for Ried.
The first masterpiece in the Rapid-Dress will therefore be kept in special memory.
"For me this is something quite special, I am out of the rapid-boy," said Schrammel.
Because of Mario Pavelic's short-term pool, Schrammel moved from the left to the right-wing side and made his life very good.
He has enough experience that he is able to exercise this position too.
The gate is worthy of him, he has already done some assists this year," praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also the flanks to 2: 0 by Hofmann after good of an hour that finally took the decision.
It would also have been possible for the guests to write about it.
Thank God we have been lucky today, Schrammel, who thus played over the breakout of the performance and outcome of the past few weeks: "The results have not been voted, but the playful was always good in comparison with last year." 
Barisic even found that in many games one was better than today - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium." 
The first three points since 26 July have shown that the team structure is intact in spite of the decline: "Today, my team has shown that it is character." 
For him, it is less gratifying that we have finally returned to zero." 
A lot of work to be done during country play is also the fact that with Brian Bieve, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger are several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger took their time to start, make the victory more precious.
"It must not be forgotten," Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Buns and Pavelic players," It was very stable lately.''
The pause for land must therefore be used to tap the wounds and raise a bit in the physical field," Barisic explained that the five U21 Aussignists will have their ranks.
One where the break is most appealing is Captain Hofmann.
He rolls over for the team, goes beyond pain.
Especially during this difficult period, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," says Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game of Rapids before his mistake at the 68th minute, and also the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350, the first match from the game was the first hit from the game since 2 November 2013 -LRB- 4: 2 on the admira -RRB-.
Hofmann: "Do not believe that everything is good right now" " We have certainly had a bit of luck too, but at some point the luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
He said, of course, to concentrate on concentrated work: "man must not always see this in black and white.
We have not played so badly in the last few weeks as we have said.
We must not, however, believe that everything is good now.
He could not disagree with the importance of his role to the team.
It is a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
It seems to me that it is in certain stages," Hofmann said.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to blame for his team.
He regretted the rapid opposition of "magician" and the regular gate of Nutz in the 40 minute that was wrongly detected by arbitrator collegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we have not been precise enough to reach Tor in some stages.
We have had too few degrees in this regard.
Interior defence Maximilian Karner saw it in a similar way: "It has started badly, then we have been pure and we have even made a gate.
In general, more would have been said about it.
There is Ruh under this Vienna summit
We showed a mighty tribe when we were dealing with the summer series "My play of the Rhöner luck" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still in the county; the copy of this tree is the "muddle" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A walk by foot leads up to an oak that is about 600 years old.
It goes past Koppeln, Basalt Stone and Basaltsteinmeeren.
A bit below the quarry of Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, where it stands.
The natural monument looks out over the other trees of the region and it looks at a height of over 8 meters above an American mock tree.
A small Buddha on a tree suggests that this is a spiritual or mystical place.
In spite of the intensive research there were only references to the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bishops' Archives and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what the change of life is with the scourges.
The outcome of his research was the rather sober explanation of the name.
Thus, until some 80 years ago, the inhabitants of the goat should have driven their animals from the most arduous fields of the region to the most arduous areas of the region.
At the foot of the tree, the animals that grew out from the climb will have to take care of themselves.
In the meantime, the importance of the area has fallen short, because in the meadows there are actually goat herds.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When you enter the stone collections, you should be careful because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for those who want to cross the island.
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but it is hidden.
Other trails are signposted to climb in the direction of Hochrhön and invite you to an extensive hike.
Where does the water station stand?
A waterway that is sought after our next task, however, is rare to find.
There is already a good impression of the building in the trench, but we have some historical buildings in the district to which building constructions could fit.
Where is our "piece of the Rhöner luck" ?
My Ring of Rhöner luck
As with previous series of the main post in recent years, prices will be added again this year when they have the right solution.
Anyone who likes to take photographs can also participate.
Under the e-mail address red.neustadt @ mainpost.de you can send us the solution and also your very personal piece of the Rhöner luck" will be sent under this keyword.
The most beautiful photos will be published.
After weeks of deaf, Italian Premier and President-in-Office of the EU, Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative opposition at the EU special summit last week won the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as the head of EU foreign policy; she will be the successor of British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government of the government that referred to La Repubblica is the vocation of his position as the favorite Mogherini in the government team as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He is also expecting a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to make the leftist party base that is always against him, because Mogherini is associated with it.
Compared with the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and as President of the Council, Donald Tusk, who was President of the Council, will make the prevailing opinion in Rome so that a political balance is made.
At the same time, the EU's chief diplomat will be the guardian of the President of the Commission.
The agreement of the European Parliament that is still outstanding will be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party -LRB- PD -RRB- an "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica is growing optimistic that for almost two decades in leading party offices, Mogherini, known for its ambition, will be able to cope with the "enormous challenges." 
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began with his doctorate in politics in 1996 in the Youth Organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra -LRB- Left-Democrats -RRB-, who in 2008 merged with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita to today's Socialist PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialists -LRB- European Young Socialists -RRB-.
With the election of 2001 in the party council of the Left, it entered into high party politics, worked in the foreign policy, the director of whom she was soon.
It has been known as the Middle East, it has been known by studies on NATO efforts in Afghanistan in which Italy is involved in a troop quota, and contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States went to the United States.
Since 2008 she is a member of the Chamber of Deputies in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini his Secretary of State.
If the PD once again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country that contributed to over 40% of the party's votes during the EU elections in May, as stated in PD-circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
There is too little diplomatic experience in Brussels that has too little diplomatic experience in Brussels, so it is lacking in substance.
In Brussels, in particular by Poland and the Baltic States, realistic approaches to the crisis in Ukraine are being tried in Brussels and diffused in as a "anti-rural course" .
It is in favour of the North Stream pipeline pipeline operated by the Russian firm, the South Stream pipeline, through which Russian gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine directly to southern Europe, including Italy's energy security.
When Renzi entered his term as president of the EU in July, Mogherini went to Moscow for her first visit to Moscow.
Photos that they showed with Putin at the Shake-Hand were taken with indignation in Brussels, just as they invited the Kremlin boss to a summit in Milan in October.

The socialists in France should "hold the mouth and order France in order," said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the disputed socialist president, whose cabinet was bridged by a large majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on its side," he said.
As a fervent gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite fierce demands for a relaxation of the regulation of the law of Mr Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande called upon his fellow socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, moved to the gear in which she took part in a meeting of secretaries of socialist legislators and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French from believing in their future.
Marine Le Pen, the far right leader of the National Front, rushed to the constant rise of the Socialists and said that it could not imagine that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, it is forced to form a new government if the old did not survive a summer.
"and the new will not survive the fall or the winter," said the beginning of the end of the year.
It repeated the reputation of her party after a dissolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that he would come out as the winner during early elections and was prepared for the government.
The ruling party of France was defeated by the local elections in March, and the right-wing National Front reached the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is under the risk of crumbling into several rival factions before the end of the presidency of the Netherlands in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences of Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience when the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and triad unemployment figures.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel fast that things change, he warned.
Otherwise, the situation will continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise in front of a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion dollars
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest crusader in the world, has been involved in negotiating the Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion according to the experts of the industry.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises, and its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd -LRB- RCL.N -RRB- and Carnival Corp -LRB- CCL.N -RRB- in competition.
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC -LRB- APO.N -RRB- also owns a 20% share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not answer to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The company, based in Miami, runs 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean Sea.
Its revenues amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, a 13% increase compared to 2012.

It reported revenues of $1.2 billion in 2013, a 6% increase compared with the previous year.
The cruise industry is around $29 billion in total, and in the coming years it will be expected for them in the wake of the strengthening of the middle classes in emerging markets such as China and India.
The company will try to position itself as the best choice for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the stock market in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder of the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
In its current form in 2000, the Norwegian Cruise was founded by a merger of a cross carrier in the possession of Genting Bhd -LRB- GENT.KL -RRB-, under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.

Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise, according to the original application documents for the price of the Prestige Cruises, have 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on a day after the election decision.
A pective group waved near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law that allows only two or three candidates to enter Hong Kong in 2017 in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a Nomination Committee, which is likely to be filled with pekingites members.
By making this choice, opposition Democrats will be almost impossible to vote for election, and to have led to pro-democracy activists to make their threats and to paralyse the financial location of Hong Kong with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong, and Chinese party leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, where China's dominance was set out in June on Hong Kong, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands of thousands of people in the city marched into the city's business district and organised a sit-in there.
Lis interrogation is organized by the government of Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice-Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted in the course of the day.
Student activists advised to meet in Hong Kong in the afternoon in the afternoon.
Britain had not seen any democratic elements until the end of the 150 years of colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands from Kiev the inclusion of "sovereign" talks with the Ostukraine
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday, Russian media announced that the Ukrainian government stops the fight against the separatists in the East of the country and is beginning to begin with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
Later, his spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, made it clear that Putin did not mean that controlling the separatists, part of Russia will be part of Russia under the control of the separatists, but it must redefine its status with Ukraine in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government of negotiations on an equal footing with pro-Russian insurgents seems to fit into the strategy it seems to have pursued since the beginning of the riots five months ago: Aid to the separatists of taking part in areas of land and putting pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija de facto independence for
In an interview with the state television channel channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the withdrawal of areas in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula to Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the "Novorossija" or" Neurussland'' region, a term that reminds us of the prerevolutionary shining times of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians, have tried to attack the elections on the 26th, and while government groups of civilian communities in the areas that have been held by separatists are trying to kill their illusions in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start with detailed talks, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society, and the state status of the South-East Asia, in order to preserve the interests of the people living there, he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood will be seen in the context with the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months since the Kiev leadership, to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern areas the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but that there is an internal conflict in Ukraine." 
Clarifying the Kremlin's spokesman for correcting the "false interpretation" of Putin's remarks, he emphasized Russia's leadership to deal with the separatist rebellion in the east, opposed to the direct Annection of the Crimea, which is the majority of the 2 million inhabitants of ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk to Ostukraine, because most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and made polls of time before the conflict a large majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments power in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, so that the Kremlin will de facto control an area that combines Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula of the Black Sea that was annexed to the Black Sea five months ago is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy and an important trade port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostowarea in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that manufacture important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on his inauguration on 7 June, the Ukrainian President of Bulgaria suggested that Ukrainian legislation should consider amendments to the Constitution that would allow greater control over their finances and the status of languages after new elections.
But its idea of autonomy seems to be strongly opposed to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels who are being accused of forming weapons and murdering Moscow.
Putin's latest call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatists on an equal footing followed another of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered the Ostukraine in front of the formerly peaceful region along the Sea of the Sea.
The separatists they supported by Russia in the hands of hand that, according to Ukrainian security officials, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea is the control of Nowoasovsk.
It is for this reason that massive civilian and military preparations have taken place to support Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants who is between Nowoasovsk and narrow access to the Crimea peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just in front of a point on which there is no return," warned Porowar.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not adopt concrete actions, the leadership demanded further sanctions against Russia, which will enter into force in the face of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday in Kiev, said.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped in Ilowajsk by the Russian invasion were exchanged against 10 Russian parachutists on Sunday against 10 Russian parachutists who were captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko informed Lysenko on Sunday.
Nudist scandal around Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no bones about his anger about hackers, who were probably naked images of his patron, Gabi Grecko and an Who who was born out of Hollywood by the A-Promis.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hacker scandal have appeared on the Internet.
The hackers who are responsible for this have over 60 naked images of Lawrence, Star of "Tribute of panem" and superstars including the models of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers, Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
From Australian actors to Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were allegedly published on the basis of an iiko picture.
On the list there are 101 Promis.
The finest who died last month with Grecko said: "It is disgusting." 
All private letters and images should stay private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and shared with others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reports told a news webside that the hack was "disgraceful" and that the people involved felt" injured.''
The hacker is likely to have 30 images of Palmer with her former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures in which she is at the top of the pool.
Among the film works of Palmers, love is invincible with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the chopped images.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ: "It is an odious violation of privacy." 
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hackers in his Tweet: "used to post images from a mobile phone is nothing other than the sale of Hehlerware." 
In purely legal terms, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Today, Radler, Jogger and hikers took part in the 8th cycle of the Great Feldberg yesterday and were supported by the association "Help for the most creative children.
The tour, which was a gate for the first one, was an easy workout for the other.
Everyone agrees on one thing: It has been fun.
Thomas Studanski could sleep well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus drove to Feldberg yesterday with the wheel.
For the good reason.
It is easy to get away from the small muscles of the muscles, especially since he has personally brought a valuable insight into his participation in the 8th cycle of the Great Feldberg in favor of the "Help for Crebskate Children" -LRB- Frankfurt -RRB-.
It is a great thing.
"I know now that I can do this -
A little bit on the move in the applause curve?
Snow, if I would have once stopped, you have had something out of it.
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Upper Palatinate City Council, many of the 718 participants raced yesterday in the early life of mountains and came close to the exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the path between Hohemark and Feldberg between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
In the middle of Red Dress, red Dress, Red Bike - made a bit of understatement at the start of the first step on the understatement -LRB- "Any multitude of professionals,!" the goal was to finish at the mountain, but after 45 minutes without breathing, he went to the finish and went to the finish after 45 minutes.
He also went through the track in a slide, as well as Nina Kuhn, Pressesprecherin of the city of Oberursel who, together with Frank Grüneisen, had moved along the way.
For the two triathlon athletes the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge:" It is about charisma, we like it - we would have made a exit today,'' Kuhn would like.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy -LRB- 12 -RRB- went to Oberursel in the morning to beat the height of it again.
In the morning at 9 a.m. in the saddle, the Frankfurt Florian Grauz took part in the saddle and "made" the Feldberg two times to roll with fun home.
Fun also had to `Fritten-Toni '.
For the boss of the Oberurseler cult kiosks, cycling through the Feldberg is simply part of it.
He had taken 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilorace-wheel.
This is a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to do so," Andreas Balzke said.
The trained Mainzer says he is a "more ambitious racer." 
He must also be part of it because he was travelling with the "fixed" ad, that is also racing bike, but without a circuit
It is also easy to climb up without a wheel, it proves not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the walk to the summit.
Bergaut doctor told Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allwheel Bully and Quad for security: "The kenn" I from Frankfurt, who trains from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sledge track that he prefers the sledge of himself.'' The man is in a sense of his own sledge.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - were sent to groups in groups in the morning.
The trekkers will first be taken at 9.30 a.m
It was followed by the first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m..
Five minutes later the first mountain bike went away.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association of Radeln on the Great Feldberg, gave the start command and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes it will be possible to lock the route to the Feldberg to safety the safety of the participants.
