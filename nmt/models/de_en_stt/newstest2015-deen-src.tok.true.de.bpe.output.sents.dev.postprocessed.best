Police of Karratha arrested 20 years after rapid motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at a 70 km/h zone and bushland to escape the police station in Bilbara.
Traffic policemen in Karratha tried this morning to stop a blue motorcycle after they watched it at 125 km/h leaving a petrol station at the Bathdate Road.
The police reported that the driver ignored the holding and continued on the Burgess Road before turning into the bushland where the officials lost their eyes.
The motorcycle and a person who matched the description of the driver were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accused a 20-year-old man of failure to respect a holding as well as reckless driving.
He is expected to appear in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.

To reflect on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights;
The congress students Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill for establishing the organisation of trade unions as citizen rights.
"As trade unions die, middle-class jobs die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and Deputy Chairman of Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud to be proud of the civil rights law of John Lewis.
This ground-breaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination on the basis of the organisation of unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops such anti-union forces.
The addition of the national law on labour law to create a way to discriminate against workers who are committed to the organisation of union representation in order to sue in a civil court for justice and to obtain compensation or penalty, is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative, at least not to American standards.
Indeed, the best way of understanding what Ellison, Lewis and other sponsors of their bill propose is the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries throughout the country, Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and comply with labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos were replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions have a role to play in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that workers' rights to unification and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers should have to organise themselves and speak up in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly said: `The right to set up associations in order to secure and improve the conditions of work and economic conditions is guaranteed to everyone and every profession or profession.
Agreements restricting this right or aiming to reduce it are zero and void; targeted measures are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chairmanship of the International Commission on Human Rights, drafted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests." 
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that human rights are human rights.
When this country became aware of how civil and democratic societies could be formed, Americans said that the right to the establishment of a trade union - and that it should then be protected by collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies.
After these rights in America, it is indeed very wise to remember the American ideal, which means that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
How Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the working-class movement did not restrict the power of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for the industry and has raised the entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History reminds us, and we should do that.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights to discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and the promise of democracy dissolved.
Judges are stopping law on a temporary basis so that all abortion clinics in Louisiana might force closure to be closed.
On Sunday, a US judge stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, from which lawyers said it would probably have led to the closure of all five infringement clinics in the state.
This measure imposed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June of the law, which was to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out abortions to force a patient intake at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to obtain their practice.
However, the decision by the judge means that doctors can, for the time being, be able to carry out legal abortions while requesting such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work legally while they seek to obtain these rights," writes Federal judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing for the judge will be held in order to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision made by the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors are betting so much time in order to obtain the rights of hospital.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana miss a law that wants to take health and their rights in Louisiana," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproduction Rights who, on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state, complained in the name of three of the five clinics in the state to stop the law
It was not immediately obvious whether the ruling extended to doctors from the two clinics, who did not join the complaint and had also asked for permission.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points in a Texas law that forced most of the clinics remaining in the state were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
The American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association (American Medical Association) have agreed that doctors' rights to expulsion require unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion are opposed to the measures being taken to protect the health of women, although some have also welcomed the effect of a closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has patients with patients who share the centre for reproductive rights.
If all other doctors in the state are not obliged to carry out abortions, that doctor would not be able to carry out surgery and that is what the group said.
In their arguments against the ruling, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the implementation of abortions, while their requests for patients would be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options result in higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video record for her mother, who died in 2007 with ovarian cancer.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying in ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women, in which cancer in 2005 was found and found that only 25% after the diagnosis was still alive.
The research manager Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Little STUDIE: New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian cancer.
The researchers studied medical care for women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing preillness and social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had already advanced at the point of diagnosis, the survival rate was at the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions, the risk of mortality was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women outside the city were dying of higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a belated diagnosis and a lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
In spite of improving telemedicine services to counter distances, it proposed as a possible remedy for a strengthening of the service of frozen doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women with a density of places to be cared for, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, gave rise to a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33, learned of the gold coast that it had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Gardening Discounts Sleeping House Discounts
The decline, combined with an increase in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, may cause gardens to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers reach a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, "the core age group for garden products." 
The report says that tenants spend 55 percent of the amount that people spend at home for their garden.
The increase of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, popular procedures, pre-gardens for parking and the fall in garden size are other factors that threaten the industry in which £5 billion per annum is sold in sales.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners from 61% to 43% has fallen over a period of 6 years, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society suggest that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can not draw plants
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Consultant for the RHS, said: "Container nurseries are very popular for tenants, for example, because they are able to take their plants with them." 
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail from the late 1980s to the middle of the 1990s, owing to rising house owners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
Protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Spiritual Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators have teamed up with public TV station PTV.
Information minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from PTV buildings.
The transmitter started its operation for about 40 minutes, but it is now broadcast again.
At the same time, around 3000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About one kilometre away they came down with sticks and stones and equipped clashes with security forces.
The police put Trenengas in place.
The demonstrators called for Sharifs to resign, but that is rejected.
Meanwhile, the army of the country is calling for a political solution to the conflict, without wasting time and without using force." 
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday night, the military said: `The army remains responsible for guaranteeing the security of the state '.
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been putted more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan, Prime Minister Sharif, is accusing Premier Sharif of being cheated by parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests were escalating at the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to invade Sharifs Residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey is appointed US diplomat on the subject of espionage
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed the oldest US diplomat in the country to a report on US and UK espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the managing director of the US Embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel, as well as the online magazine The Intercept, reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries have been spied upon each other.
A previous report, which also targeted the most important secret services in Ankara in Ankara, gave rise to distinctly angry reactions from the Turkish Government.
Warning Fairs: Train leaders are threatened with consequences for commuters.
The federal warning of runners on Monday evening could also affect the movement of persons in NRW.
The exhibition which was announced for 18 to 21 hours covers all transport companies, including long-distance, regional and city rail traffic.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the movement of goods.

Said the district chair of the trade union of German locomotive workers (GDL), Sven Schort, in Düsseldorf.
We are counting on major cases.
There are no regional priorities for this.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the movement of goods.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so that it was difficult to anticipate the consequences.
Protecting Magaluf's Coraluf of Coraluf
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the town of Calvià at the office of the Prosecutor of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The head of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption charges of businessmen and barmen in the notorious binge drink Magaluf.
The main Commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, was arrested by several businesspeople in Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs lie in Magaluf.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented the office of the prosecutor for combating the corruption of Mallorca on Friday, evidence of police officers and employees in the city of Calvià.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are being interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
National Spanish daily ABC reported that angry night club owners said that the government's cronies have a severe impact on their businesses.
"It's not a matter of making money, it is about survival," one of the businesspeople said the court.
Let our livelihoods come from the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer Magaluf made international headlines in this summer due to a viral YouTube videos, in which one of the 18 years of British tourist was shown to perform in 24 men during a tour of Sauftour Fellatio.
Since then, the islanders have tried to stop the illegal behaviour of non-alcoholic tourists in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants to the notorious alcohol-free bar.
The Playhouse Club, in which the fur took place, was forced to close up for one year, while Playhouse and the pub carnage have to pay together a penalty of €55,000 ($73.000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular among young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents involving the flow of alcohol, including the trend of Balconing, in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet conditions and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide to Adelaide.
Spring has brought a lot of pleasure to the south of Ireland, with strong winds and strong winds causing damage to flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9 pm there was another 5mm rain on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already gone down in the night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short storms, including a catch that began shortly before 20 clock and resulted in about 10 minutes for almost 4mm rainfall.
After the winter last week for an early dose, the temperature in the city on Monday fell to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C
The bad weather conditions are likely to lead to the delayed landing of Virgin Airlines from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have ended shortly after 19.30, but it was hit by a stroke - a sudden change in the windspeed or direction of a short distance - and had to run off.
At this point in time, wind reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to run through at a second landing flight and that it began at about 20.40 p.m
Flight delays resulted in delays in some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas-flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showings.
Matthies says: The highest time for big negociation is the highest of time.
In view of the process of technological progress that threatens to turn our cosy home into high-tech power stations, our columnist Bernd Matthcomes up with a very familiar electronic accessory.
While I write here, my view drops to the spiral cable which connects the phone to the phone, and I think: Boah, as retro is that?
But behind it there is a reflection: If the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around in the house in a very short time, and that would be much more retro.
What is the case for ekeltronics?
No, typos: Electronic) the rule that is the world novelty of today the electric waste of tomorrow is purchased - outdated.
For example, today there is a tube in the living room, which only says that he rejects television in principle.
Why is that?
Because the pressure of the Ifa at Funkturm this week, we can see our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
Laie, who used to blindly control washing machines and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread to him with incomprehensible expert spreader in front of it: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises to be a promise to us.
Is it still going to be done?
What are we talking about talking to people who seem to be voluntarily spreading such Quark?
For about 20 years, it is a matter of the fact that we are supposed to link our house.
This is the reason why the yogurt itself is something to be used to inform us about the fires in the holidays in the Maldives, that there is a burning in the working room.
Would n't it be wonderful when we leave the office out of air conditioning on our early arrival?
Yes, that means air conditioning ahead.
But one dream will surely soon come true: We lift up our watch, say it at home - and at home there is nothing we can do at home.
Misleading.
Everything is going to be nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred," raunt a branch of the industry, you can connect the washing machine with a headphones, the steam garer sends the weather report and the data briefs show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, which does not benefit anything because we stand in traffic
We also know from day-to-day practice: When a newer device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable will also survive the next radio shows on the phone.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza.
Thousands of Israeli children in the areas near Gaza returned to schools on Monday, when they spent the summer in air shelters, while rocket and mortar in their communities collapsed during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools in Gaza remained closed, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school start in southern Israel gave a sense of joy and anticipation to communities in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, a member of the "Pashosh" kindergarten who was hit by a rocket, before the arrival of the students for grenades from the walls and slides.
"We have a bit of fear, but they are excited," said Ronite beard, Anwohler in the Kibbutz Saad and there English teacher.
Many children from our region urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it's "funny" to go back to school.
"These were difficult times and we did not go out of the house at all" they said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer its support.
Until a ceasefire broke down last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the border to Gaza in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer grenade, hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about one dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children have been temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza, which is hard to draw from the Palestinian attack.
He invited children to learn a lot and said we will make sure that their knowledge builds up and offer you security." 
Israel and Hamas agreed on an open-ended ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire gave rise to an immediate end to the fighting; however, major problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for Hamas to lift the Israeli-Egyptian blockade on Gaza and the reopening of the air and seaports in Gaza.
Israel is calling for Hamas to be disarmed and for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers to be killed.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians have been killed, three quarters of them are civilians, and at least 494 children are estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these claims and estimates that at least half of those have been killed, but there is no concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar shells during the fighting in Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 aerial and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza region, with about 250,000 people seeking refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which have been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective rooms and continue the fighting, the educational authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon be open so we can continue to learn how children in the world and the Jewish children are said," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl calls into question NPD-prohibitive proceedings.
In view of NPD's loss of votes in Saxony, CDU has expressed itself in favour of an end to the ongoing NPM prohibition before the German Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - Laut CDU should find an end to the ongoing prohibition against the NPD in front of the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD performs worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU-Landeschef in Baden-Württemberg, the Leipziger Volkszeitung.
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development which leads me to the result of combating the NPD politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
In the vote on Sunday, the NPD failed to achieve the 5% threshold.
A first attempt at a ban on the far-right party failed in 2003, because constitutional protection had at the same time an informant in the NPM lead.
In December 2013, the Bundesrat submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join forces.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now being placed in tents in tents.
The head office for refugees in Harburg is bursting at all seams.
Now three tents of the Red Cross have been set up by the Internal Authority.
Local politicians were informed only briefly - they are rather enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to stoke reservations of citizens and give the district politicians no chance to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, leader of the Group of the Green Party in the Harburg district assembly.
Her party requests that the district administration of Harburg currently provides unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be placed in the three tents.
The reasons for overfilling in the initial intake are the onslaught of help-seeking - and the fact that the authorities can not provide enough places in downstream facilities
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The home prices have experienced the most severe winter growth in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP-data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual rise in prices was 10.9%, more than twice as much as the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
The Research Director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are setting up a two-tier market.
The numbers of RP show that the home prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets include Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six per cent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which has been hard hit by cuts in government spending, has risen by only 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lavless said it would now be possible to see an increase in the real estate for the next few months, which would be to subject the market to a real test.
"If you look at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally faster sales rate and the constantly low interest rate, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the new press, he is contrary to statements by the Managing Director, Peer Medau, and attests to this `as a field '.
The style of the university is not, that is, it says in the communication.
For example, the Medau family had already been informed about the request of the university in the middle of June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July are definitely wrong," he says.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "decisions of some sort," but" preferences.''
Also the development of narrow roads to the castle up to the castle is less dramatic than that of the Meda.
It was nine metres on the road and there was no mention.
According to the current status of 5.50 metres, this is a metre wider than before," Pügen l explains.
The argument by the Medau operator that their free and compulsory parking spaces in the future will only be used by students in the university, do not mean to be counted.
It is not possible at all because this can be solved intelligently, as in other public areas.
Thinking of the resident
The Kinderkrippe Bergwichtel, which is situated on the premises and is situated in front of the entrance to the parking deck, should not be affected by the university president.
On the contrary, it should be remembered that this is not just a question of the birth of children, but also the proximity of the inhabitants at the arrival of the Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring Realschule.
In other words, it is a lot more than special interests in the interests of the interests of the people of Medau '.
Whether or not the criticism of children's nativity with the development of the road is meant to be "one of the few natural spots in Coburg," the reader himself can choose.
At the beginning of October, Pachell, along with the State Building Office of Bamberg, wants to inform the town councils about the construction development of the higher education by 2020.
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the kindergarten last week about the university's plans.
This means that the access for the new car deck should not be the same as before on the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but on the Medau hill.
This means that narrow roads on about one kilometre of length need to be double-lane.
According to the calculations of the Medaus, traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would be ten-fold.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles a day.
Until now it has not been possible to comment on the project.
Glandorf comes back from a national team of players.
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
For this decision, the 31-year-old of the national league of SG Flensburg-Handewitt found health problems in particular.
The decision has not been easy; it has matured for several months.
It is time to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team," the World Champion of 2007 shared on his Facebook page.
This means that it is based on a balance sheet of 167 countries and 576 goals for Germany in the international retirement age.
As part of the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson he will no longer be able to take part in Torehunting for a couple of years.
With the Icelanders, who announced on Tuesday his kader for country games against Switzerland, Glandorf conducted a long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have impressed me in the same way as they will be enthused by my longtime players and my successors.
But for my club I want to be healthy in the coming years, there is a need for longer regeneration breaks, which do not allow the current double load to occur.
In 2012, the left wing had to fear his career.
As a result of the problems he had in mind, he had to be treated by team doctors at the German Handballbundes (DHB) with a Cortisonspritze which later caused a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf announced an action against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional career and eleven years of national career go beyond the body.
I have some health sites that I can not ignore
After the three problems of infection, which took place in short intervals in 2012, I have never really got into grips with my blood pressure.
A number of other wear-related complaints arise in this regard.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that while I can control my head, I ca n't fool my body." Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine "Handball Time.''
For a comeback it would only be available in an absolute emergency.
"I am always ready to talk," said the two-fold family of the magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can play handball.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012 I have become rather humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I can at the very least be able to go.
In addition to the WM-Ttitle in 2007 and the win of the Champions League 2014, he took 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and in 2010 (TBV Lemgo) the EHF-Pokal.
In 2012 he also secured with Flensburg the Champions Cup in Europe.
German Economy in Spring by 0.2%
The crisis around the world slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2% from April to the end of June 2014.
This was shared by the Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade, too, has slowed down the economy.
For the first six months as a whole, a total GDP increase of 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013 is due for the first half of the year.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland Mooiste," which for the first time led through the town of Burgmannsstadt.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar on Sunday experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenriders." 
The biggest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-moss." 
This is the biggest cycling tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants in their registration at Jos, Huerne thanked him for the organisation of this round trip by the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various trade journals.
We come from Den Helder and are over night to take part in this tour.
We also want to know the Münsterland in this way," cyclists were delighted about the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration at the club at the club we will be participating in the contest.
Katharina went to a small "peace journey" through the city over the Wall where it took place.
Further the route which was advertised for three different categories was in the direction of Herrenholz over the Schöppinger mountain in the direction of Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 height metres and 145 kilometers at 1775 metres above sea level, cyclists showed their good stamina.
They were cared for en route in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Heinz Lölfing, the main organizer of the city of Jos, was very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are happy and it was a nice experience for all parties.
The organisation ran without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately not many participants came as the event organizer had hoped for, which was likely to be in bad weather forecasts and in the morning rain.
"In 2015 we are looking again to see nice weather on 30 August or another weekend, but still return to Münsterland, and the organizers are planning a new version.
Konstantin wake to honest memoirs.
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, politicist activist, ex-prisoner, to 287 pages of paper.
In addition to this, his memoirs, which were born in Munich on June 1, 1947, have written every chapter by means of an appropriate song text.
And he is ruthless: From Onanie to high school to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave any human weakness.
Also to show how he has learned tolerance in dealing with fellow human beings.
Broad space includes also abstract, but the more important terms are one: Love, soul, ego, the existence in the now, spirituality - all he tries to go to the reason, on a very philosophical basis, but also in a very personal manner.
He also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment, as well as his music (opera lovers became a soul and a rock musician) but also his stay in prison.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the asketic monk who is created through subtraction, as he says, "leaving everything out of hand." 
There are also brief anecdotes between all the highly spiritual views on the earth: For example, about thugs in a place frequented by GIs, there is a crazy car journey in which he set up a tree at the front.
That is what he is utterly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father has never left me in the arm.
Never said "I love you" 
Henry was one of seven children in a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was worked in a factory and relationship, was limited.
Henry tested for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, who were partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a combination of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was difficult to know him.
She never saw his face, he only heard his voice: "Listen to the Krach.
Let your sister rest in peace.
Stop yourself!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already when I was a child - went to the bar with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a bit brighter now, but they are dark, deep stygic labyrinthe with flaming and smoke is dark.
My father once put himself in the tub and then he could slowly hear how he began to sing because he was able to wash the foundry.
When I ran there I realized that he had done it for years to put the meal on the table and that my respect for him was greater.
However, Henry grew up as a child without her parents' love.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you." 
Only when my mother at the end of her life went badly, we began, "I love you, I love you, I love you." 
Through his own daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with "I love you" ?
Stop killing me!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still with French in which he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys's own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
When I was very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said `You need to be radical.
So I moved through this fitness and I also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henrys's career in career changes may be found in his elegant and short cut bar.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he is captured by the theatre.
It followed The comedy of the aberrations, and then Fences from August Wilson.
This is another experience than that of Sitcoms and comedies, which filled his busy working life.
He began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered it on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His TV career began in the middle of the seventies, "I was for a pretty long time the only black Imitator/Comedian on TV." 
He learned at work.
I had to speak not only in front of the eyes of the public but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient Witz narrative while I was through television a star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
As his manager owned stage law at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people called "black anmold," Henry ran his comedy there for five years.
The hotel was clean, the hotel was clean and the staff were very helpful.
I somehow hope it would never happen, but I do not regret that I have done it.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on major projects and learned how to deal with a big audience.
But this "long award-winning light pillar of British TV" was also a" grotesque parody of black people.''
As a result of the introduction of figures celebrating British black culture, Henry worked in the 80s at an alternative comedy.
The first set of the lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the 90s he was known among others as the chef, Gareth Blacklock.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film rolls have been a prelude to the next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought: "What are you going to do next, Len, because it is everything you feel it is time of time or a little at the point.
Then a documentary series for Radio 4 came with the title What's So Great About?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
In Shakespeare I was really allergic.
I had never learned anything about him at school and mostly I found it for a domain of middle class, whites in pantyhose and a carbon head in the front.
So I have a great deal of fear of it.
All who we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Do not make it bad if you do n't know what you are looking for.
Take a couple of words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare.
Henry made 20 lines out of Othelsoon's final speech for the documentary and he was excited.
I had the feeling that I could achieve that.
It was almost as if someone had finally set up my head at last.
"That is it is a serious matter, that they take your text seriously, when you search a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that did not happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the mists.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could not believe it.
There was a moment when I thought "Oh, you have changed you." 
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little vote said to me `You have to close 10 minutes while they repair the computer
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went from the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God." 
I am not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role." 
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
The text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That also came well, it is like a big shield of the Gods who tell me that is your destiny." 
He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.
So I stand by it.
I love that.
I love to be in a sample room.
But Henry is still the head of a comedian - our conversation is crossed by humorous outbursts while he is imitating people.
I have decided not to do a booth comedy because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of stranger is somehow dangerous.
If you look for it forever, you will be driving in front of a wall.
I sometimes go live in the Apollo when I want to do that, but I do n't have much of it as I used to.
I would like to ask him whether he/she is going to be a booth.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps a start, a middle section and the end of a journey - I do not think I want to give up again.
Is that, then, its new incarnation?
I think so.
I am happy to be an actor.
It is fun.
One is always told a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi blocking Road in Yemen's Capital
In the conflict between Shia Huthi rebels and the Yemeni Government, the Huthis have called the Huthis to be a civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi-followers occupied on Monday main roads in Sanaa, said a spokesman of the Huth party "Ansar Allah." 
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report about a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online issue of the newspaper "Yemen Post," Huthi-leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for action on Sunday evening.
Huthi, according to the leaf, threatened with another escalation of the conflict unless its demands were met.
The Shia Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni Yemen, demanding the government's resignation.
The tribe of the Huthi has been besieged by the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built camps of protest at the major entry in Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there is always bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya According to State officials to stop "ghost workers" 
Kenya has begun to register all state officials to delete "ghost workers" from government pay lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would not be paid, a declaration of government.
The government is suspected that thousands of people will be paid after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in public services when he took office in 2013.
In a study at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700,000 pounds) per month was lost for "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be paid to accounts after a person died or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded.
Everyone who would not do so without a credible apology from the pay list continued the communication.
"By doing this, it is essential to rationalize the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also correcting the pay list at both levels of government - the" ghost labor" will be eliminated,'' said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal about the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be held for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi-founder of Theo Albrecht, demand compensation from Achenbach and two of its companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil process in Düsseldorf 19.4 million.
This was shared by one of the judges on Monday.
In the lawsuit, Achenbach cheated at the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and calculated Berthold Albrecht as higher sales prices that were actually paid.
This meant that the agreed commission was higher.
Achenbach purchased items of value for 121 million euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He spent 44 years in school services, of which 23 were school leaders.
From this period Manfred Richter knows many studs and collaborators from their time as a pupil.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his efforts to see people.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves painting with the motif of his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
Already with 14 he was after four years of secondary school for teacher training.
One year later the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their homes.
After a few months in one camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight car.
This is what judges in the Upper Franconian Senkendorf have been waiting for.
The formation of teachers took place in Bamberg.
For that purpose, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometers per week to the next train station, with the train to Bamberg, where three kilometers across the city go to school and return in the evenings.
After two months, Manfred Richter in a Rot-Kreuz-Home in Bamberg got a sleeping opportunity: With up to 15 participants in a sleeping room.
In 1951 he made the first and the second state exam after three years in 1954.
As Oberfranken did not have a free teacher for him, he went to Upper Bavaria and came to school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "milling room" was his first" apartment'' in school.
In 1958 he referred to a three-room apartment in addition to the school in the new teacher building next to school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, in Kollbach there were three classes in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
As of 1968/69, they were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf school association was established, only primary school remained in place.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then Rektor Georg Sigl in Karlsruhe changed and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so children and their teachers were able to take up today's construction, in 1997 to be extended in 1997, according to the construction of the children and their teachers from September 1982.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor, Ludwig Götz, who, in addition to a workshop in the field of municipal administration, built a workshop for the construction of a workshop in 1997, although that in accordance with the guidelines for school buildings was not eligible.
"Mayor Götz was very indebted," judges remembered.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who replied to a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget your love," Manfred Richter said what he had heard as a young teacher.
"We have to give children two things: Roots and wings," says today.
He said: "That is not always the case: Whether he only means his students or his own six children is not very clear.
In any case, judge sometimes was unconventional.
When students are beaten, they have not received criminal work and have not been beaten for the night.
At the expense of the community, judges had created two pairs of boxing gloves and made the two counterparties compete against each other, even though there was one thing to do.
For the benefit of the school, judge as a Rektor established a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the party no party to retire after his retirement, at least in 1996 as a last on the list of local councils for the local council.
But judges were elected in place six, and the CSU joined.
180 km in 3 days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists set up in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and stop stopovers.
When Radler takes part in their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots, this is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of stopping impressions was made: The 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour along with escort tross enjoyed a break at the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the gravel Alteburgpark.
Under the motto of "cycling and celebrating at newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" , participants met at Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: The cyclists took the first stage, 60 km over Florstadt in Bad Salzhausen and continuing to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen the athletes were welcomed by the mayor Hans-Peter Guggenheim, who was involved in Bad Vilbel with the bike, and the head office of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all sorts of good things have been prepared: The women in the city of Ranstcity and Nieder-Mockstadt, 85 sheets of apple, Zwack, stream and cheese cake, which meditate wonderfully with the skilled cyclists, have been raging.
"These cakes can only bake land women," a participant in Aulendiebach praised while he stopped another little.
Cold refreshments could be found at the drinks booth of the workshop at the gym.
The duo Bravo taught the visitor with famous melodies from operettas and musicals, attracting enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "It deserves, and finally he has already teamed up at present." 
Meanwhile the mayor and the manager had to work: They were interviewed at the fountain in front of the tip store by reporters Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Since the first hr4-Radtour 2004 as a tour leader since the first hr4-Radtour 2004 in 2004, it was possible to do a lot of the technique on the ground.
His Pickup Druck, in which he communicated with three phones and a radio with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squadron of the police state, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants are coming from the Rhine-Main region," he told us," also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from many cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends on available accommodation capacity.
In category I place participants in hotels, in Category II at collection.
The spa had a good impression of the spa when it broke up after a year and a half: "Chüss!" 
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" She came to leave.
After the arrival in Scots the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists in the idyllic Alteburgpark were requested.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had a beautiful festive atmosphere and of course it had prepared delicacies, such as flame cake with well cooled spring white.
The mayor, Susanne Schaab, GTS-Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as a board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were clearly pleased with the "many operations in Scots." 
DJ Tobias Hagen then gave the dance stage free.
In spite of the sporting activity on the bike, the occasion for a packed lunch in the open air was used in spite of the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests there were increasing numbers of people who were as enthusiastic as cyclists in good mood.
On the second day for cyclists the stations of Birstein, Guarditersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy against the government
A total of 33 policemen have been arrested in Turkey on account of the suspicion of conspiracy against the government, reporting local media agencies.
The police authorities did not make a direct comment.
Among those who were arrested, 14 senior police officers are reported, reports Emperriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government workers, including four government ministers in the last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they were alleged to set up organized criminals and tap telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) described her approach as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric in the wake of him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost across Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
He told them that not all schools had opened up again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The festivals in September were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful across Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful sky.
Ukraine, a vast common Ukrainian national front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, School Director of the School in Slavs, who visited Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will at last be peaceful and that children are given education which will be useful to them in another life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding ballons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
She meets with a proud glory from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tor party.
And it has its own frontal experience.
Her career began at the world management consultancy firm Bain and Co., which changed her to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the chief post of mother company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their compensation was supposed to have been £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, the former Chairman of BP, when she was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: She became an adviser in the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
In May I described the task of the Chairman with a poisoned kelp.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: In the first in the first Guard of its own system of manageway hierarchy in the BBC, but also externally as a voice of public anxiety and anxiety, when things run wrong.
This provides for an almost indefensible duopoly, which requires full reform.
But what new president would risk going to anything and widening an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may be doing his job himself.
It is a difficult task.
And, as if that is not enough, many of them are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status.
While competition is approaching and new technologies threaten old and comfortable collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is linked to particular dangers.
For the modest amount of €145.50 per year, the British public is buying one of the largest media companies in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: It says it reaches 96% of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence per day.
The BBC seems to be up at the top of the list: 53 per cent today, compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago, is as high as possible.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I now receive news headers on my mobile phone and I can see programs fit in later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
It needs a remarkable chairman - I hope it has found it.
Perry from Texas says that degraded Tweet was not authorised.
A Tweet from the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a damning remark about the democratic local prosecutor, who is at the heart of a criminal prosecution against him for abuse of authority.
The Tweet was deleted later and replaced by another of Perrys's account, which rejected the previous one.
A Tweet has just been sent by my account which was not authorized by me.
"I do not approve of Tweet and deleted it," it said in later news.
Officials of Perry did not answer requests for comments immediately.
Although the Tweets of Perrys did an official account, it was not clear who actually feeds the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavourable picture of the district prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned in April 2013 for drunkenness at the tax.
Perry put a veto on a financial promotion of its office when she refused to resign, which led to a prosecution against Perry - which might be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the Tweets reads: "I do not always drink with the triple permissible alcohol level but when I do it, I do Governor Perry when it chases it." 
I am the most addictive democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted to the jury of the Grand Jury of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the prosecution a political trick.
His highly classic team of legal counsel requested the case of the case to dismiss the prosecution and argued that the law against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government funds in the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is located in Travis County, and in cases of state corruption in Texas, refused to resign.
This veto gave rise to a public complaint on the part of a left-right watchdog group.
Perl's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he finished in Iowa in Iowa, when he ran for 2012, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by sending a Tweet of a photograph of himself in the vicinity of a lake near a lake, in the words "South Carolina, we!" 
Berkeley explains housing market for "normal" again.
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in Southeast England has returned to normal levels again.
Homes in the capital have been hotter and are the subject of enormous price increases, which the Bank of England saw as a result of widespread fear of a credit bubble to set limits on mortgage credit in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, founder and Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the top in 2013" adding that this is a" stable action environment.''
The property market in London was well placed during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Katowice Office, prices in the city alone last year increased by 18.5%, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average sales prices at Berkeley's private, cheap and student offers increased by about a fifth of last year and were £423.000 at the end of April.
A stronger pound, however, has been less attractive in London for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric by a possible "Villtax" before the general election in May.
Last week, the London estate agency Foxton warned that, in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April would also lead to lower market growth in real estate sales as well as prices.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decrease in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the property market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for the rise in housing prices in London to 3% by 2015, on the basis of a already fragile national price awareness.
Transaction volumes in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, have now fallen by one quarter by year, according to the real estate agency WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a home home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the due amounts for futures amount to more than $2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and remained stable as a result." 
In June, the company reported that it sold 3.742 new homes in the year up to the end of April - nearly one-third more than at the peak 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40 percent every year to €280 million, sales by 18% to €1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the Annual General Meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year is likely to be in line with current market expectations.
According to analysts, the annual pre-tax result is estimated to be 450 million.
In the afternoon in London, Berkeley shares had a fixed price of 23.96 £.
Naked pics of Jennifer Lawrence by hackers on the Internet released.
Jennifer Lawrence perform at the 85th Oscarlet.
Naked photos by Jennifer Lawrence were released online by a hacker claiming to have a "master list" of pictures of other 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star of "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are authentic and chased the hacker because of" blatant infringement of privacy.''
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo sharing site 4chan have allegedly been posted by a gap in the online storage system icloud by Apple, with the alleged "master list" of the victims of the hacking include the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Wenger and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported by Buzzfeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, though Wensity, Star of "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"With those of you who take a look at the photos which my husband and I have received in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you are so happy with you," wrote Written on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and" Vicities'' however, the photos about pictures of her and tweetete "These so-called nutpictures of me are falsified, people.
Let's take a look at the beginning of the beginning.
Buzzfeed reported in late Sunday that a spokesman from the pop star Ariana Grande rejected the genuineness of the supposed photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed novel about love and the letter "J." 
They flowed in the best way, they came down slowly like a carton that is left in the rain.
Occasionally a woman said to him that he is too serious, tiring, intense, deep, and perhaps a little cramped.
And then he shook his hand.
He knew he knew it.
He was stony, as in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this barrage was a just beginning affair which was more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling beauty with a broken hair and a flattening heart from a village on the North Island, which was even remote and was warmed as port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older person who held Kevern for her aunt, and inherited a plot in a damp but parasitic valley with the true name of Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leck, in the bathrooms there were still spiders, neck necks had left their traces on all the windows and they believed they were all that, and the garden was overseen with weeds that looked like huge cabs.
It was like the house out of a children's fairy, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is at the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
In addition to this, Kevern had an unusually warm spring afternoon with an unusually warm spring afternoon, both of which had a sense of humour in the board which brought the country to an old track of a long-forgotten black entertainer, and invited his father to closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played in the console.
They have not been banned - nothing was so properly banned - they were simply not played.
It has been successfully made obsolete, as the word becomes obsolete.
The general taste of what the rules and regulations would never have been and how the people in books choose the vom-Teller weighing millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romance of love, they have chosen the ballads at the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to dig great feet in a grob-comic Serenade.
Ailinn did not understand that.
"This was a familiar song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller, he explained it and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
That had his father always did to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It began as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father was playing with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It was not a very funny game at the time and it was not very funny now.
He knew that was expected of him, and that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn has never been one of them.
Jazz was not played, even though it was not directly prohibited.
The improvising was no longer modern.
It was only place for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be completely sure at the beginning of a melody where they would end.
That is what the mind is.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had become 10 years old without having heard about Sammy Davis, Kevern knew something about jazz from the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he did not have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At age she was unlikely to remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints applied.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of a group - thanks to the fate of fate.
People with a Caribbean coast were prepared for entertainment and sports by temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran them.
People who originally came from the subcontinent of India were blessed as by nature with electronic talent and were served with the task to ensure that no family remained without a working service.
What was still left of the Polish community took care of the sewers, and what was left of the Greeks.
Those of the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly when those WHO do WAR, EAR ES happened to WAR to be charged with fear of being charged with fire-fighting, for fear that the flames would consume them as next - had laboratories and Shisha-pipe restaurants opened, thought and were depressed with the inaction
Everyone according to his abilities.
As she only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could ever be demonised.
Music was an expression of love.
"These are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He was too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security.
Nothing could be done to overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbonated leaves.
Ailinn still does not understand.
Why should your father have such a little love?
He wanted to say it was a Jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in her present.
She already thought it was rather strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head and blocked the vision of his head.
There was nothing else around the world than what you might think of.
There was nothing he would have wished to see.
"If you say it, I mean it without conviction.
But that does not explain why you are presenting it to me.
It seemed to be very worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet do not so directly.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit
And you say you hate me because my ankle is too fat?
You hate?
Of course I do not hate you.
That is all that is stupid.
He might have said "I love you," but for that it was too early.
"Your big ankle is exactly the reason you meet me, but he tried to do it instead.
I am a bit perverse.
That did not sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the comforting charm they needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be Kevern, who would be.
Despite its friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was red and rose up from their deckchair, the console threw it and buried the wine it used to drink.
It is not an excuse for him for wood in wood.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, how Palmwedel appeared in the storm.
"And your thickness is exactly the reason why I feel a little too excited about you," she said.
In addition to that I'm not at all.
She was sorry, both for the inconvenience of his words and for the fear she showed in her eyes when she was opposed to it.
Did she think he would beat them?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as it was here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke down here as it was on the waterfront.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and according to the CE WHO happened WAR than it had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always prepared to raise the hand against a woman who denied or despised them.
Dickhead?
They have shown a big fist if they did not fit in!
They only kneel - the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the unspeakable love ballads from the console - they only kneel and then beat.
According to Kehl, this was an unnecessary refinement, as this was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign in his body.
He rose up from a deck chair like an old man.
They also felt dead, but they surprised them with their sadness.
That was not the end of the world.
They were barely aware of this.
She saw to him how he came away - as a room at the top floor looked at him - a man who complained about something he himself summoned.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some of her hands had risen against them.
One man turned to her to bow down, it is ashamed, without combat spirit - why it was a sight she seemed to know well when she could not remember a single occasion she had seen before before today?
When she was alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
For a number of years before the events that have just been mentioned, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher commissioned by Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for public sentiment, in a short talk about continued violence at low and intermediate levels, is taking place at a short time about continued violence at low and medium levels in exactly the country where the reduction in terms of reduction in terms
"There is a lot of work to be done, and much needs to be done," she wrote," to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who led to thousands of wars, and most of it won, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the land where the sweet breath of human kindness historically has rarely been felt in spite of the high
But some features turn out to be intractable.
The higher the church tower, the more it seems, the less the passion it continues to inspire.
The people crying for listening to sentimental ballads are tempted to believe in stories about outdated difficulties in believing in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only the former crude of rural communities as well as our urban fabric, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious dispute at home, in the workplace, on the streets and even in the fields of
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," she said she had read the whole report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask: Are you atheist?
"I think I do not need to say that," answered ESME Nussbaum.
Are you literate?
Once again ESME appealed to her right to privacy and denial of the statement.
Feminist?
Once again, there is silence.
"I do not wonder what Luther Rabinowitz said," because I would be against atheism, reading or feminism.
This is a real job of free.
We serve a society that is unbiased.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are perfectly acceptable and praiseworthy, may occasionally distort the results you have presented.
You yourself seem to have prejudices against the church, and these things which you refer to as being "back-like" and" roh,'' could be interpreted by others as an expression of a course of strength and vitality.
If you continue walking around what the IST did, if it happened yesterday, it would mean that if it were going to happen, it would be the country to take account of its essential vitality.
ESME Nussbaum looked at while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head an LED font in Flamingorosa repeated the advice which Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile your neighbors, value your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, speak your phone, speak, explain, you say, you hear, you speak, excuse yourself.
Speaking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand perfectly what you want to do," ESME Nussbaum replied with a calm voice when she was sure her previous one had ended, and I say nothing other than that we are not yet as effective as we are deluding ourselves.
My concern is that, without prior warning, we may find ourselves in the way in which we repeat the mistakes that only happened to DEM.
This time, however, we do not have the other in which we leave our rage and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed with the hands of a pyramid.
To indicate a patient's patience.
"You go too far," he said," when you refer to actions as a "mistake,'' which our grandparents may have committed.
They go too far when you say that they have missed their "rage" and their" suspicion'' on others.
It should in fact not be necessary to remind somebody in your position that when we understand the past, we do not speak of ourselves and of others.
There was no one and there was no `other '.
It was a time of disorder; that is all we know.
"Of the one we are honest about ourselves, ESME dared to say that no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I do not blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good to do what happened is happening.
That was at the time.
Nothing needs to be said about this - we are in agreement about that.
And just as no guilt needs to be given, there is no need to be blamed if such eradication were appropriate and if there was one way to wipe it.
But what is the past if we do not learn from it?
The past is that we forget them.
If I can say something about that -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed her.
On the next day she went to work as usual, she was driven by a motorcycle driver who, as passers-by described, went on foot in a kind of "brutal rage" .
There are some cases.
Lesotho-military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Officials of the military in Lesotho fought to have a coup to overthrow the government, and said they were going against policemen who are accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and told us that the army of the country encircled its home residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The Premier brought his family to the adjacent South Africa, when he reported about threats to attacks.
Military spokesperson Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no coup in reality, but that the military is responding to the threat posed by "political fanatics" whose weapons the police have in front of it.
"What happened this morning was that the Defense Forces of Lesotho acted after he had received several intelligence reports that, within the police, some of the elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party political fanatics who were short of damaging some of the most devastating damage," he said about Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman, Clayson Monyela, said that military action was the impression of a crash.
"Even though no one has claimed that the government has torn itself through violence, all the reports agree that the defense forces in Lesotho have shown signs of a coup," he said." 
Spokesman for the military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that soldiers are falling into their barracks and that the situation in the capital is calm.
In the meantime, the Deputy Deputy Mothetjoya Metsing takes over governance during Thabanes absence.
Thabane told us that he believed that he had become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been great tension since June after Thabane parliamentary sessions were suspended because of the confrontations in its unity government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations of dissent.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month level
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point of the last 13 months in August, with a closely observed study.
The final market purchasing manager of the producer (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a booth of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 is an expansion.
New orders came back and factories experienced breakdowns at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will be held before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a sluggish recovery of the eurozone and threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that, in the course of this week, the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, might provide further information as to whether it will take into account a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although a little growth is better than no growth, the impact of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for producers has become clearer," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The Fabrik-PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economy nation in the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a sort child, as well as Italy's descent from a solid expansion to stagnation.
References to the fact that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism in Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands do not take place are also not reassuring, as Mr Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the impact of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
A positive note came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, to the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing manager in the eurozone in the eurozone in August is that the sector continues to grow." 
He added: "Producers in the eurozone are obviously very difficult at the moment as the current elevated geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainty in the more difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and it is likely that some orders will be delayed or even cancelled, in particular large orders in particular.
He said that it would be "always more likely" that the ECB should, after all, launch a kind of QE," although we suspect that will be limited.''
Since the horrific siege of school, the hearing of the survivors of Beslan has passed since the terrible siege of school, as the children of them are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people from Chechen militias were taken hostage at a school in Beslan in Beslan.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of Greueltat in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the appalling siege of the school of Beslan, in which 334 people died, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in loathing, and surprisingly transformed into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of Greueltat in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell is going to be followed by them.
Their biggest hope?
That is the end of the war which is now affecting Ukraine and where children are dying.
The girl who was photographed at the attempt to climb into the shattered school sports hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri earakov and became famous when she only tried in her underwear to climb back into the broken school sports hall after a mine had exploded.
Aida was completely confused by her mother, Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
Both were dead, but they survived.
"A woman said to me that I was going to run my life, but I could not," Aida said.
My legs were bloodstream.
I stood up and climbed back to search for my mother.
A soldier put them in safety.
After a series of operations, she was completely healed, but she said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I fear I have to continue to operate again.
Some granules are still in my knee.
Their goal is to become a dentist in order to help the people who have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not break into me," says it is going to flow.
"That happened to me and it is impossible to change that.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remind me of those who have stayed there.
My friends and I try not to speak about it in other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and we dreamed of going to school.
"I do n't want to marry until I finish my study and start my career.
To a family I think later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, although the memory of each year becomes somewhat weak.
I am glad that many people in the world are still reminded of our horrors and that we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me, as I return to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help to avoid happening again.
The boy who fled through the ball gel thought his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (Russians, with 7 years in school) and survived the three-day siege to the poor of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old he said: "Mama told me I should sit down when there was an explosion and keep their hand
After an explosion he thought she would die.
She said to him: `.
Full of fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a little child who took it at hand and fled through a ball gel.
His father, Vladimir, who closed his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said: `I could not save them '.
In reality, Tamara was out there and with leg injuries in the hospital, for its part, in the assumption that her son was killed.
After reunification she said: "I wept for joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) in order to be awarded the title of a Barnardo `s Children's Champion by the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows every day, but I wish I could stop by remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is blowing in my memory.
I still know that I threw all my toy guns out of it.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is not a problem for me.
"I have no fear of going back to the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, with whom I played in the courtyard and they have not managed out there.
We never say they have been killed or are dead.
We say they have remained in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London, especially to the toy shop, where I was able to pick everything I wanted and driving in a above open car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends have suffered.
This horror is persecuted every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me.
"I'm so sorry for all those who are suffering from greasy," said Damir, who worked in a monastery last week as a volunteer.
I will be happy to help.
I will go to the police one day and hope she will take me at the Training Academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: 37 children from our neighborhood were killed, you can imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there have simply been no children who have been able to call and walk around, and this stillness lasted many months.
It is vividly reminiscent of her journey to London with Damir.
The people of London wept when I told our story.
I understood at the time how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the prize and the possibility of travelling to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting you and her husband remember in London and helped Damir and me.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borashsch and call upon all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant.
And that was just one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British shared our pain and supported us.
She said: `I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is continuing and every day people die and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are such children as ours.
I think many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or related.
I simply know what these people feel all the horror.
And I can not stop feeling to feel it
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir was large and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not overwhelmed by the past Greueln.
I know he does n't like to be reminded of it, but he has six close friends in the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and light the candles there.
When he was small, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the couch, the face of us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember how all of his weapons and other military toys were continued.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I have been so sure that he is dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I saw myself and saw the hell around me, with body parts that lie everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could not have survived.
"I remember that I called him," Damir, race, race go away," but I was so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he has gone away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, continues for us.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan-survivor Georgij Lyin, with his mother, Fatima, after the siege of 2004, is on the right a picture of Georgij today.
His bloodstream face was drawn by fear when he ran out of his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dismissed him for his first school day before she rushed to bring her older son, Vladimir, to university.
"I left the court about two minutes ago before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not quite, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date approaches, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is no single day to remind ourselves of this tragedy.
We do not think that it is long ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes from these days follow me forever.
Nobody will forget that; I promise you.
Insistent: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school this day and he said he wanted to reduce his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden at home at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also believe that the people of all over the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt we ever learn the truth.
People are investigating such tragedies over and over again and are never learning the truth.
And now they investigate the crash of these Boeing in Ukraine.
Are we ever going to know what it was?
This world is becoming a little terrible.
"I can not understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, as happens?
Ten years is nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to make it a little less.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a couple of nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
I went to school later in 2004 and were afraid of every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when 1 September approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It is difficult for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I do not feel the sacrifice; this history is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not paint myself.
My life goes on.
I completed this year the school and visit a medical college in Vladikwkaz.
I will be a heartbeat.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not stop.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgij Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorist
One miracle: Georgij Faniev was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is truly surprising that he has not been killed.
"We feel it was as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer but could not do that because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me that it is nothing I left behind me.
I am older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I actually felt a little better, but I can not forget it.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005, in the course of the year, this was the first and only time I went to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return it again and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survival: Georgij Faniyev today, with a photo in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is immense and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do n't like to think or speak about it and they never asked me about school.
I think it is a good thing I am right.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can now run well.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB intelligence academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have submitted my documents, including medical ones, and they have replied that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been behind me for two years there.
He learns to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said: `I knew I would never tell my children about my experience.
Children should not be aware of that and, of course, they should not suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It is worse in my soul when the anniversary is approaching.
I am going to pay for the celebrations.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It must be much more for him because it was there and I have not.
I waited at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me; all of them are drawn in Beslan.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.
It is difficult to accept that if something is so unfair.
He is a boy, he likes sport, but he can not participate because of his knee.
It has operated on a number of occasions, it can run, but there is no sport.
I would say that it has overcome 50% of the horror, but we can never completely overcome it and forget it.
We will always follow this terrible experience.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only increases my pain.
I lost many people who I knew well and which were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is crying for the ducks.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also widows who never married.
It is difficult to accept that life continues, even if we do not want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people struggling for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I almost do not think so.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and are still being killed.
If we all resort and throw out them - as far as we can.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was safely worn by a Special Command Command
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is brought to a security by a Russian Special Command command (left).
She is now ten (on the right) and does not remember the cruelties.
The world breathes breath in 2004 when Baby Aljona was born to the poor of a Russian policeman in the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists left them go, but in their cruelty their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall kept back.
Makhar, three years of age, escaped, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has been married since then and has a little girl with his new wife, Swetlana, to name him after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, which is ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown to an intelligent and happy girl to say neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories of the tenth anniversary.
They will understand why.
Man accused of crossing girls at pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is in court because of the passing of a three-year girl on a pedestrian walkway in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The prosecution says Mr. Steward has steered his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and the girl is injured.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruth, disputed the accusation in front of the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC filed the proceedings for January.
4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos.
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most economical option is a waterproof point-And-Shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are worth about 300.
I recorded these photos at a family firm with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of less than 350.
Regardless of the equipment there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other subjects are closed.
Place your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some of the cameras and camcorders have scenes and recording sessions to optimize the exposure time for the cooling underwater conditions.
And before you jump into it, you can test the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras can only be approved for up to 5 feet, some other up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not fold.
Point-and-slot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images you normally do not have.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So you do a lot of pictures.
When your camera has a string mode with which a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings are made, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is dramatically worse as you move away from the surface.
When possible, stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Take a close look at the objects.
This is also a good advice to the country, but it is all the more important in terms of the poor conditions of light.
It is especially important when you are working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need to approach your objects in a very large way if they are to fill out the whole picture.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things, even in a gigantic organization like the NHS.
As an advisory anaesthesia, he devoted his career to saving the patients both the agony of the disease and the agitation of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife was a MI6-employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that diagnoses and diseases are important to doctors, while the treated mainly deals with something quite different: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the person whose suffering began.
"I did not feel myself," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulties making me amazing.
While he fought with the fierce symptoms, he noted that he impatiently reproached his wife Juliet.
"I'd like to do everything as soon as possible," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for one week, Lawson felt completely unusual and without reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to perform an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he had been in the French Alps to go skiing.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast, that is to attack the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is very difficult to determine.
For example, while a number of smokers are diagnosed with lung cancer, not all lung cancers have been smokers in the past.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases the trigger is an asbestos strain, contact with the fiber construction, which was once known as a "miracle" has since been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960" s, when the industry voluntarily committed itself to no longer use it.
Even in areas where it was still used, only people in certain sectors were working directly with the substance - plumbers, construction workers, carpenter and shipyard workers for example.
As an industrial hazardous material from another era, it seems unlikely to be worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is the culmination of a Mesoltheliot epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die as a result of road accidents.
Annual Statistics of Mesotheliomid cases since 1980 and prospective future deaths in the UK
The reason why we now have the fatal effects we have now experienced when asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999, all types of asbestos have been banned), is that a mesotheliom has only developed after decades.
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not confined to former workers in the construction sector.
Asbestos was, and is often still, in the houses we live, the offices in which we work, schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
Therefore, Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protected area.
Parliament's buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
The hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogens.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber either.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have been in contact with asbestos.
Then he found it.
"It looks like he wrote a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed six years of my education.
All - students, nurses, doctors and Pförtner - use of the tunnels.
One wonders how many people are suffering from the same disease?
I am sorry to say that he has at least been able to answer this question in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been educated at Guy's Hospital, who have been sick in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010," I am the last to still live''.
How many are we going to develop?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 5.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty per cent of all Mesotheliomes die in eight months after diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Mr Lawson's question as to how many of us will still be ill? '
Britain's leading expert in Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050 a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen, between 1870 and 2050.
Most of them do not have any idea at the moment that they will die.

A brief glance at the files of the courts, in which those concerned are often dealing with claims for compensation, shows the extent to which the scourge of the Mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, was exposed to asbestos by Janice Allen.
She spent nine years working for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothes department at two sites - one of the flagship store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she began to work at M & S
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing, she says," I have never heard of Mesotheliom that I did n't really know anything about asbestos.
I have never thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the concept of asbestos does not relate to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word `asstform ', a description of the fibre structure, which makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof boards, floor plates, pipe insulations, pipe insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but it is regarded as a "major health risk" by the EU and by the WHO, with possible death order.
However, the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that there is a clear but indirect indication of the fact that this was one of the main reasons for the uniquely high rate of trade fairs." 
An employee at Marks & Spencer was exposed at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, asbestos at Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical Mesotheliomber, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is not unusual.
He put forward a study of the victims which show that `a significant proportion of Mesotheliomas without a known suspension by work or in the House has been caused by asbestos contact in the environment '.
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks as if nobody can expect it to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which investigated the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could not knowingly have been exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the services and pipelines behind the committee rooms in Parliament were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be broken up by something as harmless as "strong air movements." 
Members of Parliament are often accused of dealing with their own interests, but this seems to be the opposite.
While the directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Western Minster Palace received a "clean health product," it is now undisputed that 1 billion pounds have to be spent over several years to renovate the parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the general election 2015 Members of Parliament will be meeting at the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than the green benches at Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that `the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the provisions in question
Nobody can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
All that can be done is to wait.
One person who has never been able to determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he had been exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints have been made positively," he says, but I can not prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you have worked on and the data.
What he remembers is the day of early December 2009, when he got some kind of fever.
He was 45, and only late in the evening led an operation.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came quite suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I did not think it would be possible to build the car at home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the nipples, the skin around his lungs, was blowing.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a Mesotheliom.
He did not work for one month.
Doctors made X-ray recordings of his breast and put Pleurakathether to take liquid out of the lungs and test it in the lab.
His complaints, however, remained without a diagnosis.
His health was slow, and he returned to his work.
From time to time, however, symptoms have returned, often after sporting activity and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient arrived at Abbotts with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesotheliom.
But also Abbott now did not do this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The link in the case was clear.
In September 2011 Abbott's situation deteriorated and his family doctor brought his CT-Sscans and X-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the Ripp- and the Breast.
I am an optimist.
I usually continue to do it," he says.
To be honest, I have not had as many concerns about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy lay in the week between Christmas and New Year: "It was said to me that it was Mesotheliom." 
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesotheliom
Suddenly Abbott had dates with Macmillan-nurses, one of which recommended him to take a lawyer.
It is only now that it is a concept of the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, particularly in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," says he.
The people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now affected.
And so Mesotheliom meets younger people who have not worked in the traditional professions.
The most dangerous pipes in hospitals in hospitals have been under the earth, so patients have probably not been exposed to the substance.
But many employees who in pedestrian tunnels changed from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), came in contact with the toxic substances.
It is evident that over several decades after the war, hospitals for patients may have been life-saving but are life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students put their Bunsen burner on asbestos mats.
And it does not just affect hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and cities because of its fabulous isolation and flame retardant properties.
We also have schools.
In fact, many people have probably had the first contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemical customers, students have switched their petals on asbestos mats.
The subject of asbestos in schools is often referred to in schools.
Meanwhile, so many innocent items in our houses, such as floor tiles or scales of scales, contain asbestos by default.
"It is an industrial organisation that is included in much of our real estate," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact involving a woman concerned was the demolition of a gardening shed in the 1970s.
This is why you are looking at how you take away your garden.
The effects of diagnosis and the knowledge that the disease is incurable is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and I tried to continue doing, but I realized that I could not focus on what I did.
I have been in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and look after myself.
Well, I will not experience another Christmas.
The main difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he recalls how overwhelmed he was about all the information he had to cope with.
"It was very difficult to record it," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long I have yet to do?" 
And there are about 12 months to come.
I remember I thought I was not going to experience another Christmas.
That is what it was." 
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our lifeline mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of the smallest of fibres.
When the asbestos is broken and the fibres are inhaled, they can be fixed in the breast fur, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the nib and may trigger cell mutations.
"The problem comes with the inhaled nadelshaped asbestos fibres," Professor Tom Treasure, a Heart Thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital of which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed it to the asbestos, is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated a number of others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital.
As soon as the asthma reaches the lungs, Treasure says it is pushed by the breath at the edge where the skin is.
From the very beginning it is invasiv.
The usual options for other cancers do not work well in Mesotheliom.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotter.
Some say it is worth an attempt.
Treasure denies that.
"It is not possible to cut the nib," he says.
They do not come up with the knife.
Meanwhile, cancer "on chemotherapy does not mean very good, but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But they all die in the end.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott was in contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and advisory office.
"Hello, cancer central," he made himself happy with calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis for 4 years and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which last four months and are expected to only be extended by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to make things appear in a rather more positive light." 
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart -thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to go further, I just cried out and got a date," he said.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and must wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is crucial to Mesotheliom-sufferers in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if, after all, these treatments inevitably fail, many people are of a different financial concern - about the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It is known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960" s, it was realized that a very little burden was a health risk.
And here companies" negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital in their case did so, but it was not what Morgan called "full compensation," because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom was due to an asthma contact at Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, a spokesman of Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s." 
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is a huge problem for Mesotheliom-sufferers, who seek compensation, a huge problem that can be attributed to fatal asbestos contact of a company or a job - for decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance records can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but that they are certainly not with the plaintiffs.
As a result of this, this year there has been clear new legislation, which makes it easier for experts in metrology to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer available.
The law has provided an investment fund of 350 million for all the funds funded by the insurance industry which was diagnosed after July 2012, but is unable to sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have been able to speak in a normal compensation process - about about 120,000.
About 300 successful applications in the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many Mesothelioms, thinks that 350 million has been a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and evidence suggests that this is a quarter of what insurers have had to pay unless time has gone away and Mesotheliom-sufferers find companies and normally sell them.
Mike Penning, the Minister of Labour and Labour, also admitted that the law is not perfect.
But both pitted like Morgan that rapid action was needed every day in the face of seven deaths.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing in December of last December.
At this time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her initial deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation in which he, unlike Tom Treasure, expected a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 per cent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
This is something we can always see in patients.
There is something you can continue to do.
When you wake up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott fell below the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Replica scans did not show any signs of illness.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I have just been 50.
That is not life-threatening.
That is vital.
Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of tumors is more visible.
But the process is both physical and psychological.
They have to think about practical things - about the money if I am no longer or my wife shows how the messenger timing works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
They need to look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.
"It is hard for parents," says he.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease with which I would not be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and uncomfortable.
She told it about her friends and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was more restrained.
She did not say a lot.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to pass through.
But talks of this kind are not crossed by hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The illness (as it finally is for Stephen Jay Gould) is a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government elections, protesters swear retaliation.
On Sunday, in spite of the increase in democratic reform, the Chinese parliament ruled against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the people of Hong Kong.
This is likely to be the long awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activist activists die the planning and mobilization within less hours after the announcement.
The decision by the Chinese National Congress allows the communist leaders to reject all of the candidates who are not pekingloyal.
"That is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, leader of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing had promised.
We have lied to the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
It is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice-secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for Hong Kong's government would be "chaotic." 
Since 1997, when Britain gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing promised to allow the inhabitants from 2017 to choose the seat of government.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because it gave Hong Kong citizens a direct vote, but the decision also made it clear that China's leaders remain stuck in the sequence of a nominating committee of Beijing.
According to a new provision, only candidates "with love for land and the love of Hong Kong" are to be approved.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicised protests in Hong Kong have taken place for a number of years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to decommission the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within a few hours after the announcement of hundreds of Occupy-Central-followers, hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters came together in the rain before the government district in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks they planned to focus on protest.
However, they did not make any reference to this, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers reported that the movement "the occupation of the Central District was only considered as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all the chances of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and on Sunday there were stricter security measures on Sunday including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is exacerbated by the sense of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland reinforces competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a growing fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy-Central-movement demonstrations, as they put business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong - at risk.
"The protests they are talking about may cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they continue to continue," said legal expert Regine Regine, Regine Ip, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We do not want to worry that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media reported recently about the democratic activists in Hong Kong who were controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the voting rights, in which 450 000 people attended - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of them attended one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school leaving stables in the USA is now transferred to universities, where freshmen are offered with their private aircraft.
We are happy to respond to this demand and offer Britain's first luxury travel service for students of today.
To achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said that the service saved a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise need to stoke their assets in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options we are looking forward to ensure that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that no new bookings were made, as the service was only introduced but it added that "students" would book the service in the next few weeks.
The company also announced that a market for this offer expects a market for this offer despite the study fees of 9,000 million a year.
Students today differ greatly from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and we can do that with VIF.
However, the National Student Union criticized the services as being taken.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for higher education said: `This offer seems to be completely separated from the life of the majority of students.
Many students starting this month with their studies are faced with a crisis in the cost of living, as the available financial assistance in the form of credits and scholarships does not keep pace with the highly rising bills for the most basic bases of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on the arrival in the student residence.
Feminists criticise racial questions and police behavior according to Ferguson.
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo..
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands high, not shoot, while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online talk of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
While tensions in the Middle East rose and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned to 100% of the race.
In comparison with the responses of black women shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays with titles such as "thinking about Ferguson of a white woman" and" feminism is not only about the oppression of women'' comparatively late.
But for Perez this was an important change.
"I do not think there are many people in feminism who speak about the white, and privileges speak in such a high way that they said.
People felt compelled to express something about the events.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnically that it must express it.
For English professor, Coritha Mitchell of the Ohio State University, Ferguson exposed problems which black American people are exposed to every day but which are not seen as women's clothes in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 Likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
When I say something about how Farms are under siege in their home country, the silence is stunned.
"How can it be safe for women to speak in public about a relationship?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex, and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate issues; they live every day in a combined reality.
While white women are now combining race and sex in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender at George Mason University, says that its predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were jailed and the explanatory statement was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynchkilling.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point when white women in favour of women's voting rights, such as Susan B. Anthony, the country in the late years of the nineteenth century, analyzed and established that the struggle for the right to vote could only have been successful for one group in each: Women or black people.
"You made the decision to stand up for the rights of women, and the right of the right to vote should come later," said Hattery.
When one remembers such things, one with power becomes aware of why coloured women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade before white women in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching were organised.
The group was established nearly 40 years after the original request for assistance from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists have been playing with the problems that black women have dealt with for generations.
"It would n't be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation, who built their career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means, try to understand what that means.
The well known white feminist activist, Gloria Stone, came to Facebook in two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a definite article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another, but parallel reason to understand one of the dangers that are inherent to the body - and opinions on race, which are very different in public opinion polls - will lead to change," Stone wrote.
Although Stone stands for a rather inter-sectarian feminism, where racial and gender issues are addressed, some of their comments about the racial issue in America are astounded.
Christina Sommer, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole Feminism?" She The People that young men in the United States, in particular young coloured men as their sisters," are far more vulnerable than their sisters,'' but Steinem's remarks to Ferguson are contrary to their earlier critique.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But, when the White House recently issued a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young and hispanic men to help, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The relationship between police and the black community is not the only problem that is in the forefront of mainstream feminist.
After the US border police force has taken up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border of this year, the issue of immigration reform is also the theme of the surface of this year.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that, for a new study of the subject, it must only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of working visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate in women's organisations," she said.
"pig house" in Ipswich is for sale.
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate brokers when it became clear that it showed a huge pig that had been made comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is situated on a private road in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000.
One of the details was a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig that put his head on a couch.
Real estate brokers Connells said the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner.
"The photo was published by mistake and has since been removed," said a speaker of the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the earlier gathering as a "unique one-family house with one bedroom." 
Although the real estate agent has removed the picture from the website, it still seems to be advertising material.
Domestic sales were in the interest of the social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SWCITY Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lottowin.
A lotto player from Harvey is standing this month.
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth takes place, with a lucky winner who gets nearly 1.1 million out of the lottery education on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey moved for the second time in five years the jackpot in the draw of the first division, after 1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, still needs to be reported.
The store owner Steve Forward said the profit for talking is in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city talks about nothing else, and all are pretty excited.
We thought that gain could occur.
Eight WA-winners celebrated profits last month in the first division, an appropriate conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a married couple from Belmont had just a few weeks prior to the mega-gain of $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the profits allow for the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly 85 million.
Leonidas asked to the Gladiator Arena.
Not only the gladiators in Matsch were at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors who stood up to the rain of rain and rocked cold from the historic spectacle.
There have been a colourful series of depictions, performances, games, exhibition items and information about the Romans" time and its importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting force of the Gladiator School of Amor Mortis, which used every period of the time to demonstrate its robust combat art in the Arena with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presentation and sent his men in the ring to the heroic two struggle in various gladiatorial classes in the ring.
The first of these were the "Provocatoren" in the series with a rectangle and a short string as well as leg rails at the left leg and arm on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with nipples, a short slip of the head and iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
The appearance of the "Centre of the Regions" which came out against the" Secutor'' was particularly impressive, following the recent struggle against the Burmese.
One of these was heavy metal, the shields flowed and the litter flowed through the arena that fear and bange could be made around the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis," the muscular referee, had an always attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and experience the culture of the Roman period," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the Association of Friends of the Roman Canal, the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, for one day the park became an "Oppidum Roman," a Roman city like Vice President Claus Wehage in his speech.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this can be seen in the Roman day, for example "aqueduct marble" of the 11 m high and 1400 metre long Roman canal bridge which once stood at the hotel.
The Frontinus Society once and now opposed water and energy supply, and Petra Fricke, Managing Director, knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of that time." 
Ralph Heiliger, a graduate of the engineering team two from Rheinbach, presented measurement instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypothet, the hot-air conditioning that once heated the Roman villa.
It is impressive to see the footprints made by Wolf and fox two millennia ago in the footsteps of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the Rhineland Association was buried at the remains of a Roman villa in the industrial park Nord in Rheinbach.
One found a change in the walls of an economic building with a Darre for drying cereals and to mourn.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, a farm property, the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A series of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the conclusion of the Germanes in the then Roman Rhineland, which suspects Morscheiser.
At the same time, the children also worked with the Roman wind mill, similar to that of today's milking game, or wrote how the Roman students called their names with metal handles on wax boards.
At the booth of the Roman thermal baths in Zülpich, the children were allowed to set up glass mosaics at the stand of the Rheinbach glass museum and at the booth of the Eifel Nettersheim are used for a heavy wheat mill made of stone to use the flour for a bread or a cereal.
In addition to this, it is possible to take a look at some of the most important aspects of everyday life and see what they have to do.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the community of Wachtberg in the city of the Rhine will take place in 2014, reminding us of the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
In collaboration with the home and historical associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Association, the association association and the Oberbachem Laienspielkreis, thematic hikes, a talk, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and remembered by the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legion from his work at the appropriate Wachtberg will tell us that plants are presented as living thinkers from the Roman era and offer a funny lesson in the understanding of international understanding between a group of watchdogs and the inhabitants of the Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often no longer visible in the first glance, are to be found again.
In the Wachtberger City Hall, a small presentation to the Fund of the Bercuman Matronenheiligalism in 1879 will be remembered.
Ebola: The epidemic is affecting West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies take a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to West Africa's economy.
The crop rotates in the fields, the mines are leaving and markets are orphaned - the virus has found it difficult.
A number of international companies are also taking part.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," explains the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest hit.
"It is a total disaster, we lose very much money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who is sold in the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
The market only means who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is hit hardest by the virus, alone the fever fell victim to more than 600 people.
Health officials recently declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, thousands of others.
Foreign companies are attracted by employees.
Companies operate everywhere in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies like Arcelor Mittal are pulling their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying.
Local traders and farmers are also responding: Few merchants are still leaving their homes to deliver.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia that are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important to export are being eradicated.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is going to be short
"People are going to spend less and less travel," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.
The man for example, who usually goes to the market and sells vegetables, is better off at home.
The population is therefore faced with the consequences of the epidemic: Food is scarce.
In the markets, stocks of staple foods such as rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international firms, is threatening an image of images - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time, Philippe Hugon says by the French think tank Iris.
It is essential how far the virus will spread and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may think that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus invest as well." 
The disease is also putting the disease under pressure on states in the Member States.
The disease also places an strain on the already strained national budgets of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets are being heavily stretched by high spending on the health care system and in addition to the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank promised to bail out the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (€45 million).
The impact is also felt in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta region has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people remain at home for fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels are also clear.
Celebrating their 50th Anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12th to 14th September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald preparations for the 50-year founding ceremony will be from 12th to 14th September.
The project is scheduled to take place on Friday, 12 September, a great entertainment night with the group "Dorfrocker." 
On Saturday at 6 am the big Böll shoot.
Then, in the big party of the evening, there is a mood with the "Stoapfälzer Spitbuam." 
Brass band for music
Highlights on Sunday are the feast service in the parish church and the big celebration at 14: 00.
In the afternoon there is also the distribution of the price of the Federal and Gauck.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 dames with their Dirndln.
Festkapelle is the brass band in Berngau.
The patronage is taken by the mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907 when the association was founded on March 21, was the association for" social entertainment through an exercise in the use of room protection and small bananas.
In 1937 the Nazi regime led to the dissolution of the association.
Only in 1964 there were 19 young men who were born on the 30th of April at the Gasthaus Lukas the "new" Schützenverein" Tannenwald'' Berngau.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the association as a protectorate through a difficult initial period, in which it was mainly a matter of finding a club and installing the shooting range.
Already in the fall of 1965 the Schützenverein at the restaurant "Leininger" started with two teams in the lap races.
In the following years, sport lovers, who have now been organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st of Gaulie.
For the first time in 1980 Rudi Meier achieved the magic line of 380 rings.
As the performance of the active shooter increased, the number of members has also been positively developed.
After the association "Leininger" did not meet the requirements of a modern protectorate, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the cellar rooms of the new" Landgasthof Härteis'' in future.
After a working performance of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988 the priest of Strasser for the new protectorate gave the church blessing.
One of the major highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaushoot connected to the solemn consecration of the new Schützenfahne in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary of founding.
A Böll Group was established in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl was a member of Böll.
A great challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the focus of the Bavarian Böll Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association last year updated the rooms and shooting range at the Berngauer Hof and thus brought up to date the latest in technology.
Eleven teams in lap races
Can be seen also the sporting achievements of the Schützenverein.
In total, there are eleven teams of eleven teams in the race: Six air cast teams, an air gun crew, a sports gun KK1, a youth for youth and two teams of AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann have risen to the district 1 in the round of 2013/14 from the Gauoberleague (highest league in the Schützengau ANB).
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml have risen to the Gauoberleague by the Gauleague North.
In addition to the shooting range, there are events such as horse-riding, carnival and royal ball, club flight and Christmas party tradition.
For those who want to take part in festivals, they are a parish and a community.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when he return to the circuit.
Tony Stewarts' return to the circuit ended at half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove for the second time against the wall after his right in round in round 172 cut in and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car in the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that his 14-year-old team was disappointed, but the race will now be at next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had better use and a better outcome for him," said Johnston.
We go to Richmond and hope we can do it there.
Stewart went to a wall in a collision with Kyle Busch in a collision with Kyle Busch and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I went down to a good result today with very good hopes of a good result," Johnston said and added: "It was simply not working." 
Not long after the second accident, Stewarts car was loaded into the tractor and the team had been packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart won three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an Aschenbahn race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week, either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in pursuit.
He returned to his work, while an investigation into the tragic incident leading to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. was investigated during a race to the track to confront Stewart.
The authorities reported on Friday that the investigations will continue for at least two weeks in the cause of the accident.
No decision has yet been made to determine whether Stewart has to be charged with prosecution.
The three-time champion was received with a great applause when he was presented in front of the race.
After a start to the 12th position, Stewart entered the first 10 shortly after that and was temporarily in place four.
After a reboot in round 122, bushs fell.
Car with No 18, out of control after the exit from curve 2, collided with Stewart, whereby both cars drove against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell in place 21.
Looking for Friends of Dance
Simply try it: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and leader Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to work.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups in the TV Jahn can create full lessons in secondary schools.
After the summer holidays some groups have been severely decimated.
Now we are looking for new players for a sport that is healthy and is fun.
In Lisa Neitzel, a former dancer in jazz and Modern dance band "Spirits" there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of 8 to 12 years, six in the group of 12-15-year-olds, tells the 20-year old.
With more active, the whole would be much more fun, "one could dance very different choreographies," she says.
Those who want to dance can take Thursdays from 17 to 6 p.m. or on Fridays from 17 to 18.30 in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without any obligation at the training hour.
"The training regularly begins with a warm-up program," says the Trainer.
After that various choreographies will be practiced.
Jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no defined form, so it is open for many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical to sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, conviviality is not too short.
"We are going to eat, we are looking at dance films and we have already stayed in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can join friendships, share a wonderful hobby and do a lot of work for your own motor development.
In one of the other offers of the TV Jahn there is one in one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always take lessons in classes in children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini bed, video dancing and hip-hop in classes.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Those of you who want to take part in Discofox, Long Walzer, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can check out and take part.
Bulgarian Prisoners protesting nationally
Hundreds of prisoners of prisoners from all of Bulgaria have organised a national protest in front of the Supreme Court of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they repeated their requests for restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also included in a list of claims which is to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
For one month the officials have protested symbolically against the new working time and are calling for a return to the former 24-hour strata.
Despite the meetings between the union of prisoners and representatives of the Court of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations take place, shared the Director-General for the implementation of penalties, Rosen Zhelyazkov to the BNR.
The protest of the prison officers is likely to be supported by members of the union of unions of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has given up to Luhansk airport.
In the eastern Ukraine the prorussian fighters continue to advance.
After severe battles in which Russian tanks were supposedly involved, the Ukrainian army today, the airport of rebel stronghold Luhansk, has given up.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously had political consequences for the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists, and announced changes in the chief army of the army without giving details.
Prorussische separatisten schossen aircraft ab.
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, prorussian separatists have once again shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in the region of Donetsk, and the insurgents reported on Monday of the Russian agencies.
Sinking the Coastguard
The insurgents also claimed that, for the first time in the Sea of Azov, two boats in the Ukrainian coast guard had sunk.
Ukrainian border guards confirmed that two of its ships came under fire on Sunday near the port town of Mariupol.
While seven border guards have been injured, a speaker in Kiev said in Kiev the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several villages in the area of Donetsk came under their control.
A diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In Minsk, the capital of Belarus, today the Ukraine Contact Group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a representative of the separatists from the eastern Ukraine should also take part.
In the run-up to that, all of the actors used their appearances to make their demands public.
NATO does not break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break with Russia as a result of the planned deployment in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council in 1997.
However, the leader of NATO accused Russia of "a flagrant breach of the bargain." 
"Today we need to face up to reality that Russia does not view NATO as a partner '.
Documents and opinions from the Russian side suggest that they regard us as enemies.
Strengthening NATO
Rasmussen has also announced that it wishes to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that" we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary,'' Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow at New Gas Talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to settle their gas strikes.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, the Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is time to wait for a decision by the European Union, whether it would be a representative of the talks.
As a result of the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has no longer been able to fuel Russia for weeks.
As a matter of fact, EU Energy Commissioner, Günther Oettinger, has communicated between the two parties.
Ukraine had warned, Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe accounts for approximately one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, of which a large part of it flows through Ukraine.
Merkel talks about power: Toll is going to be "very clear" .
Now the Chancellor is once again committed to doing so.
But it is not a carte blanche for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the toll on cars have made the CSU stand out.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken about persistent opposition from its CDU to the introduction of a toll on cars.
"To make it quite clear: It is in the Treaty of Coalition, and it will come," the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU panel councils in Berlin.
On a detailed model, however, Merkel did not stand up for the time.
The black and red command of government is called "certain parameters." 
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and work is now being worked on
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its no to a toll right on all roads.
Merkel also emphasized that the finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was constructive in the deliberations on a bill.
In addition to the topic, Dobrindt also talked about other ways of activating more private capital for infrastructure investment, for example in terms of broadband.
"There is nothing special," Schäuble left a" Mirror'' report on Sunday Schäuble said his house is testing an own concept for compensating motorway investors with toll revenues after the election in 2017.
As a result, Horst Seehofer, head of the CSU, warned against developing toll concepts against the relevant minister in the Cabinet.
Mr Laschet expressed his opposition to this.
"The coalition contract has never been able to record all cycle and federal roads," said the National Library of North Rhine-Westphalia.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again about the issue.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesfederations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll will affect small border traffic with neighbouring states.
As a result of toll criticism from the ranks of the CDU coalition, Seehofer had called for coalitions to be made.
The left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute within the Union.
"The Murks-toll is dead," said the leader of the party leader Bernd Riexinger of the" New Storck newspaper'' (Monday).
"The toll fails the minister," Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is to be started in 2016.
Domestic car owners may not, however, be charged in addition to a coalition agreement.
This is why they should be given full compensation for the toll by means of the car tax.
But the model must not penalize foreign drivers according to EU law because of their nationality.
Misdiagnosed genetic Diseases
A britin says she thought she would die over many years as a result of misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another illness.
She actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnosis is a frequent problem for people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe flow and curved toes.
Disease is also affected by deafness and pain; the disease is incurable and progressive, meaning that the symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers 13 was 13, she believed that she is suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (IAs) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before it would be 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old, said, "As a child I knew I could not do the same as the other.
I fell constantly and everything took longer for me.
I could never ride with the other children rollshoe or skateboard and are often in school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations for discharge of their Achilles heel and stretching of their feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from IAs.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I have told no one, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA-society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and got into panic.
I thought I would be with 18 in a wheelchair and I would die with 25, and in between all my abilities would lose.
I made all of this on my own and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she was 17 she became aware that her skills had not fallen so much as she had imagined and that she asked her doctor.
He stood simply, and hugged me and said, "My love, I do not think you have that, otherwise you might already be in the wheelchair
I think you have something a little less life-threatening.
After a number of genetic tests it was found in the CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt as if I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Aware month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel A. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireman since the closure of the former force of force.
For almost ten years, the former troop level in Münsingen has not taken place.
Nevertheless, every month of lethal ammunition is found at the heart of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be blown up in the field.
A deafening bang is hallucinating during the explosions over the heart of the biosphere.
In December of 2004, the last sharp shot at Münsingen, a force for military operations, was closed at the end of 2005.
Since that time, the 6500 hectares of land is the heart of the Biblical Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open in 13 designated ways for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on businessmen in the area of Washington is rising with economic recovery.
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
Government and local tax authorities in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published study last week, and firms in the region of Washington were no exception.
Companies in the Area District, Maryland, and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion in government and local authorities in 2013, increased by 3.8% compared to $26.6 billion in 2012.
Last year's government and local tax burden rose by 4.3% to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9% per year, and it was the third year of growth after several years of declining decisions in 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes stronger than local taxes increased by 4.3 per cent, according to the study conducted by Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a fiscal policy group.
More than half of District, 56 per cent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 per cent of its revenues come from companies.
Virginia has 28 per cent of the lowest tax revenues in companies.
Much of the rise in tax revenue is based on a recovery in the real estate values of companies, researchers say what led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year in terms of growth rates of less than 1% this year.
While much of these gains come from major states like California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to be meeting for Washington as well.
Companies in District, Maryland, and Virginia spent more than $10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of a year by 4.2%.
But the apparent recovery in property values in Maryland is not so effective in raising government and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes amount to little more than a fifth of the tax decisions of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their national and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the real estate, particularly in the fiscal area around DC, is either the ownership of the government or non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes to be able to offer the same services offered by other states.
The recent recovery in tax revenue by companies can not be estimated over the recovery of the real estate market
Business income also seems to be recovering, such as the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes for government organizations of 2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland accounted for $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase equally in all three places.
The rate in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an above-average level of tax of 4.1%.
Virginia has 6 per cent in all three departments that have significantly lower income taxes (in all three there are firm tax rates).
The company's tax rate in Maryland is at 8.25 percent and in a district of relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparative study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower government and local corporate taxes are being demanded, while there is a better fiscal climate than that in Maryland.
In the study the district was not investigated.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will drop to 5% next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income objectives in the coming year, this law may reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems to be better for small businesses in the area of Washington, so they pay more government and local taxes, in other words the recent study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure in which most of the small companies are organized - rose by 20% last year to 2.4 billion, a much faster growth rate than corporate taxes as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes in all of the country are likely to last this year, with an increase in overall increase in increased tax revenues for the government and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the area of Washington may lag behind when the federal government spending cuts impact on the labor market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's twin town in China now wishes to become a brewery and also hopes for a flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Guangzhou's partner city of Guangzhou - is the urgent desire of officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said Vice Party Secretary of the South China, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Time and again, the functional-level of the ruling Communist Party in China came back in the course of the call to this concern of the twelve-million metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also known as the canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
That is why people also had the purchasing power to afford to afford German beer.
The hess-based SPD-Chairman Thorsten Schächter Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he was going to be told in Germany about a possible partner for the project.
"For beer there is not much: Good water, cereals, and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party upper in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result of this, Guangzhou in Guangzhou came up with Schächter Gümbel, which was served by red wine, which was served to eat.
The Chinese brand of Tsingtao goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More Business Commerce
A second wish by the Chinese hosts would be a direct link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party leader Li.
Lufthansa had offered flights earlier, but dropped for economic reasons in 2012.
"It would be worth it again," local politicians were convinced.
"Business between our two cities is continuing to grow." 
At the present time, travelers would have to take the detour of Changsha in the province of Hunan.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital Guangzhou is, also hopes for flight connections.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, gave this desire to the Social Democrats when he talks to the Social Democrats.
"It is a very good idea," answered Schächter Gümbel - Chinese vice president of Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, who gave us a nicknamed.
Well-maintained partnership
Guangzhou's idle vice leader hopes that he will be able to attend a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already in the main, but not in this function yet.
He came to power until this year, when his predecessor was promoted to power for corruption charges.
Also the local party leader, Wan Qinglian, had to go.
The action against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against the corruption in party and administration that Xi Jinping, Head of State, is imposing.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked in front of his party career for an American company, which is very unusual within China's Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top executive in Fujian, where the car VW built a large work.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen of city twinning.
The connection to Guangzhou, which is more than 9000 kilometres distant, is one of those maintained by both sides, such as exchanges of pupils.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis at Pearl River is almost as strong as that of Hessen, with its economic power.
Next year it wants to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros reported Li.
The family of Joan Rivers "expresses the thumb" 
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since delivery to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter showed hope today that the 81-year-old woman is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa said today in a message.
We press all the thumb.
Her mother was born in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in which Mount Sinai was a hospital.
The doctors consider them to be deliberate and accurate until they are more satisfied with their state of affairs that continue to be described as "serious." 
The reactions came from many pages, including in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners who are trading today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners get a label from 1 September, at which the buyer can see key data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
New cars in the category "Euro 6" apply more stringent nitrogen oxides.
There is also more money for the scaffolds: They get a nationwide minimum wage of 10,25 euros.
Amazon is buying Twitch for $1.04 billion.
Amazon confirmed a moment ago what information was reported on Monday morning: The online retailer and video producer and a variety of other things - buy the Videostreaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million USD).
The announcement comes surprising, not because no one had expected to take over Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google was made by Google for a more cool billion, and the cooperation seemed natural, of course.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it was quickly become a platform for players who wanted to release their bracelets in games, a "YouTube for live games," a insider.
The Twitter interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which Better is a painting of secret sciences is very popular at YouTube.
It is true that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy a little bored is a textbook example of an established technicality that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not happen because the company reported it was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us reach us faster." 
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they prefer to exercise sport, it is hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others play games rather than take control themselves.
It is one thing to look at a friend at 3 in the morning while it is easy by Resident Evil and something quite different to see a spike in the way he is shot 20 times in Call of Duty.
You could now see all of these games now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego games, so without their own control over the eye view it can be a very good recipe for headache.
I admit that the quick runs in which the Roger Banners of our electronics age complete all games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as it is not a game of play or humour, his Twitter channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do sceptics like me already know?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon intend to make money?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated in Amazon Instant Video, which is how YouTube Twitch could easily swallow.
But Twitch has something that each company likes to be: Thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers.
As the Chairman of Twitch, shear, said Amazon and Twitch believe in the future of gaming, "and the medium does not show any signs of contraction, and there is no sign of it - as a spectator sport.
At the hill at Burggartenfest there was a lot of work on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers agreed.
In spite of the strong rain on Saturday night, it was estimated that 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in Burggarten.
At times they had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
Out of two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name of Amula.
For the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten, the light in the evening and in the evening is lit by a variety of shows.
Anyway, and the fun comes anyway by yourself.
This was evident in the early morning, when the first visitors to the Open Air began to open their doors.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And that is what they managed to achieve.
Around the farms on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, as well as guests from closer and closer surroundings, had made it cosy.
They followed the first live performances, wippts with the foot in the beat, very cool drinks - in short: Relaxation and enjoyment were needed.
And that right across the generations.
While one of these was on a ceiling on the extra virgin white sand on the beach bar, others in a quarter of wine in the wine cellar, the offspring at the Hüpfburg, which was a major attraction for the smaller guests, came to an end.
However, even in the case of children's shakes, the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had to do all of their hands in order to become the crowd and to create imaginative creations in the little faces.
The bigger ones used the Kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop which made the Goodfoot crew stand out.
Until the big rain came came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he stopped at the visitors, in particular families looking for space and drying.
But it did not detract from the attractiveness of the festival.
"It came to more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a" success in the whole line.
This is why there is nothing like a repeat of the big party next year.
Although work needs to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear in a first record on Sunday in relation to the vote for the people.
As annoying, he called that in the meantime they had to be stopped.
Obviously the security company had been booked with too little effort.
The consequence: Some who had already paid did not come to the terrain.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors living in the castle garden.
There have been problems with sound technology.
As a result of this, it was possible to open a new way to make it possible.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha-Loire could not be built because the tents could not be brought back to salt because of a tyre cup.
"In the next year they will be there," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open Airs was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And that is in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes which will be postponed for the first time but will have to be eliminated in the second edition.
Also in the social network of Facebook the event organizers have to be critical.
"sorry, but for twelve euros you have just been expected" says Melanie Meier at the event page.
"You have unfortunately taken a bit of it," says Ele Zimmermann.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it is very good that some people are trying to catch up on the legs.
Beware," Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.
Now it is time for the organisers to put an end to these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum
I do not think that is the case.
Rather, the included component is waiting to be used in the prominent construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the construction of the space observatory Tira is the case which is completely renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller than the old one in a diameter of 47.5 metres.
However, the size still remains a world record.
The final step towards completion of the new casing is the Kappentausch
The upper quarter of the old casing is separated and decreased by a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new envelope will be added.
When the weather is played, the action will take place at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge is pine
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain cried as much as their icy water was cast over the head to hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge went painful.
A woman was sent to hospital after she had so much at the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she gave up the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain created a so much when their icy water was cast over the head causing her face to be wounded.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was the deed, my jaw remained simple," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is being poured over the 20-year old age.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that was not going, the jaw was falling, and then I understood that something was true.
My mother and my sister saw that also and made myself laugh almost in the pants, but I had to get into the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was delivered to the hospital to allow the jaw to be resurrected after participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of pages on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castles pulling together soon?
Last but not least, there has been a clash between the two Wolfratshauser Burgundy.
Now we think about the possibility of cooperation in terms of possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, a former chairman of Wolfratshauser Burgundy, led the project in the French Guédelon.
Even a year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the castles of Wolfratshausen.
So far, positions have been very different, as is the way to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving: Talks about a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgundy) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we be able to sit down," reports Sjöberg.
In his opinion, all the members of both clubs could in future pull together.
This is how we can see results that are faster than those in progress.
While the castles in the castle were concerned with the reconstruction of the castle in Bergwald, Sjöberg, the castle of Sjöberg, is at the forefront of the site.
Herbert Piffl, Chairman of the Friends of Burgundy, was very pleased with his own personal details about the call.
Since the death of Dimge death, he is standing up for the lovers of Burgundy.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in the middle of September.
According to the 74-year-old association, the association is currently part of more than 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have been able to rest the club activities out of respect," said this `a reflection period'' to` think about how things might go on '.
According to Piffl, the new leader will then enter the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, Burgundy might also see a current mood in the mood within their groups.
There are no candidates for the Presidency at the moment, Piffl says.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself," he himself does not stand because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chair should be a Wolfratshauser.
As part of the project, Tölzer wanted to continue working on the project.
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He praises Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Due to a high level of participation by the population and volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was the first to be sceptical.
But over time I have come to the conclusion that it makes sense to push the project forward.
There is nothing we can do here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of reconstruction I do not want to personally throw on board," he hopes that the Burgverein might be moved in this area.
Their aim of first documenting history "important and good." 
After that, we could look further.
A clever way of saving in Unix books
As the cost of Unix books for many students per year is more than $1,000 per year, the fast second-rate student, Matt Schroeder, presented a clever austerity idea.
He invented a rental system for books by students of higher semesters and offered nominal compensation to delay sales.
"My Mathematics usually costs $180, but I got it for 10 for one semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him 430, he said.
He gave up $120.
However, students on average spend more than 1,200 euros per year on textbooks and study material, while students have various cost control options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution to the choice for students.
Textbooks are becoming more popular, so students can use a book for one semester, often for a significantly lower price than when they are purchased.
Neebo Inc, which runs more than 250 university bookshops, announced that the lease of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the College-bookstores in the past Spring was rented, Neebos said Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased according to the National Association of College of College Stores in Campus bookstores.
This is the unique place for the best deals.
To Buy online
Some new books cost only one third of the price they are available in the Campus bookshop.
The ninth issue of "calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost 290 $, but it can be purchased at the specialized book retailer Chegg.com for 239.99 $.
Needed to Buy
If one of the notes of other or normal usage tracks makes no difference, used books are a good option.
For 93.49 you have to have Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, final student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used issue of "Strategic Media Decision: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether earlier spending would be allowed.
Sometimes updates for seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for used books.
Rentals
The renting of textbooks is worth a consideration if you treat it to some extent, think about returning them and do not want to keep the books after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a newly purchased book.
One student, for example, could rent "calculus" for the duration of one semester for approximately $20.
Inform yourself about the terms of the business you are renting, as well as the penalties which may be incurred for writing notes, subtlety or usage tracks.
Tenant: If you do not return the book, the penalty charges may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-Books instead of traditional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of a specific period of wholesalers like Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
For 6 months at Chegg we can rent about $61.
Bracey tells us that students in literary courses often find the best offers, as many of the classics can be downloaded for free, while academic and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look at it in any case.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be visiting Pepperdine Law School, recommends the pricing of books, as you can be sure that you can find the right textbook.
And before ordering an online order, you should check, Gault of whether the book is actually in stock.
This lesson he learned about the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks and finally paid the full price in the collage book.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" has not been a cashier
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million in budget in the United States, while" Sin City: A Lady to Kill For "only $12 million of his budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" at Cameron Diaz only played $14.6 million in the opening weekend, but children's films such as" dragon landings slightly made 2'' are also disappointed in earnings.
An article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin points out that for children's films the lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films, and it was described as" dragons slightly made in 2'' as a purely functional fantasy sequel.
For films for a slightly older audience, however, it seems as though the quality of films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for every summer film shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 linen walls.
The results are based on the opinions of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators suggest that development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working at Disneys's soon, said to the website Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing." 
We have to accept that, and we do not have to try to catch up with the past.
In contrast to Hollywood's currently weak performance in cash flow, Netflix has recently generated revenues of $1.2 billion, almost as much as last year, when sales accounted for $837 million.
During the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on the filming of comics and predicting a "meltdown of Hollywood." 
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his bleak prophecy may well be a real core.
According to Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World in summer 2015, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in cash flow recently as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporters:" The next summer will be the biggest summer in the cinema at all, and no one will worry about the business.''
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district for streamlining the league classification was removed, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German table tennis has taken another 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The consequence: Those who have not risen have gone up.
In addition to this, in addition to this, it is possible to set up one of the most popular players in the world.
Torpedos's ladies, in spite of their grandiose experience, remain in the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start up in the Netherlands, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
SG Lengellers and TorpedoReserves in the new association of directors are represented in the National League there are no longer diaries of diaries.
TTV Geismar is a member of the Association for Women, Torpedo-Second in the National League.
What the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district panel.
Here are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district league as a regional representative of Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Rot-Weiß, Bovender SV II and teams of TTV Geismar II and III, The Division of TTV Geismar II and III starts at at least one in point strength of the team.
Güntersen, the TTC and TTV Geismar II are played here.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllgraben run up in the district league.
Each with nine teams
The SC Weende sends her girls to the small district league.
Also the district league of the SCW boys, where Torpedo II starts, is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded RegionsAssociation, two of them start up with nine teams in the first season of 2010.
In the west season there are the Rot-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengder II.
In the middle of the season there are Sattenhausen/Wöllgraben breaks, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Dame-Kreisleague is made up of Sattenhausen/Wöllgraben ausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in Osterode, where there are no ladies and gentlemen in the county.
It is striking that none of the six 2.circular classes is achieved; this is where the innovative and more responsive district will have to think about it.
NATO Summit: First protests at Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered into an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, approximately 150 people in Cardiff came together in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been talking to us about developments in the weekend and has talked to demonstrators travelling to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains
Two boys of boys were brought to safety with the rope winch after they were caught up the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke into their tour in Govett Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday afternoon.
Worried relatives called the police around 20 p.m., when the two did not return to home.
A search truffle from local police and rescue services broke down and the pair was found at about 23: 00 near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had fallen to the knee and the man fell and had beaten his head.
Lifeguards stayed at the couple and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in a stable state with a ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
Around 1000 demonstrators were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, information minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
After half an hour the transmitter recorded it again.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged devices in the editorial department.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
The demonstrators are asking for the resignation of the Heads of Government who accuse them of voting fraud.
The police told us, around a kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, that on Monday there have been clashes of around 3000 demonstrators with security forces.
After hospital information a policeman was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to invade Sharifs Residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called on Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters to have a political solution to the conflict, `without wasting time and using force without force '.
It continued in the communication: `The army remains responsible for guaranteeing the security of the state '.
The escalation of violence has fueled concerns about intervention by the military, which in the past has already been more active in the past.
Protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Preth Tahirul Qadri have continued since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had their supporters called on Sunday to harp.
"We will not decline without forcing Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qadri expressed itself in a similar way.
Khan accuse Sharif of having won last May's parliamentary election by means of fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of Central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government quarter.
The demonstrators had initially had peace in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called upon them at the weekend to invade Sharifs's residence.
Hütteldorfer after two seasons of the season, place three of the table.
With the 2: 0 about Grödig, a painful week on Sunday was brought to a conclusion on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had achieved an intermediary in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The experience of success was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and Torchere Steffen Hofmann, who found three of them in green in place.
Schrammel-dreamtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid with the second season of the season the right response to the disappointment at Helsinki and goes with a success experience in the land play slot.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said Mr. Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his magnificent executive from the Sixteenth in the 14th minute.
"I thought, I looked at all the frustration of Thursday and sucked him among the bar," the 26-year-old said, and I said.
When Schrammel met in a Bundesligapartie on 13 November 2010, that was still for Ried.
This is why the first masterpiece in the Rapid-Dress will remain in a special memory.
"For me this is something very special," said Mr Schrammel, who is in favour of me.
As a result of Mario Pavelic's short-term pelvis, Schrammel moved from left to the right defensive side and made his thing very good.
He has enough experience to be able to perform this position.
The gate is worth it, he has already done some assistance this year," Barisic praised.
Team showed character in Schrammel, also the flanges to the 2: 0 by Hofmann after a good one hour that finally made the decision.
After all, it would have been possible for the guests to write.
"Thank God we have been lucky today," Schrammel said," The results have not voted, but the play has always been good compared to last year.
Barisic even found `in many games better than today '- against "the strongest team played in this stadium in this season." 
The first three points since 26 July have therefore shown that the team structure is intact despite the above: "Today, my team has shown that it is a character." 
For him, it is just as positive that we have at last played zero
A lot of work during country break also is the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger there are several reasons to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start to their start, make victory even more valuable.
"One must not forget that," warned Barisic, who in the last three days has lost with Behrendt and Pavelic that" they have been very stable recently.''
The break in the country must therefore be used to "lick wounds and a little in the body of the body." 
One who seems to be looking at the break is Captain Hofmann.
It ends up for the team, passes over pain.
Especially during this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," noted Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game of Rapids in the 68th minute not only to the structure, but he also achieved the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350, it was the first match from the game since 2 November 2013 (4: 2 about the Admira).
Hofmann: "Do not believe that now everything is good" We have surely had some luck, but at some time the luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
He warned, of course, that there is a need for concentration: `You must not always see that in black and white.
In the last few weeks we have not been as bad as we have seen.
We must not believe, however, that everything is good now.
He did not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team which I can help at the moment.
I think that is in me in certain phases," Hofmann said.
Val Coach Michael Baur had little to accuse himself and his team.
He also expressed a regret about the rapid opponent of the category of magic, as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40 minute, which was wrongly recognized by arbitrator collegium.
The only criticism I can make to the team is that we have not been sufficiently concrete in some stages in some phases.
We have had too little qualifications there.
Defending Maximilian Karner was similar: "It started right, but we found it only and even made a goal.
By and large, there would have been more of it.
This is the summit of Ruh
We found a mighty trunk in our puzzle of the summer series "My piece of the Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these trees still exist in the district, the specimen shown is the "scourges" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A walkable footpath leads up to that of about 600 years of old oak.
It goes past Koppeln, Basalt clusters and Basalt Means.
A little bit below the quarry of Bauersberg, one kilometre to the north of the road to Weisbach, it stands.
Vital is a monument of nature; it stands out over the other trees in the area and is reminiscent of an amount of more than eight metres to an American giant tree.
A little Buddha on a tree suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But in spite of intensive research, there were only references to the registered trademarks.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bishops Archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to learn what the impact of the disease is.
The outcome of his inquiries remained the rather sober explanation of the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, those who were living in the goat should have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the meadows which were laborious and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animals who grew up are to be rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows there are actually goat herds in the real world.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has further found out.
However, you should be careful when entering the stone collections, as the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular location for those who are tempted by the sun.
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is hidden.
Other paths are signposted, lead to the direction of Hochrhön and invite for an extensive walk.
Where is the water castle?
However, a waterway which is sought in our next task is rather rare.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the structure, but we have some historic buildings in the district in which the building of buildings could be appropriate.
Where is our "piece of the Rhöner Glück" ?

After weeks of deafness in Italy, Italy's Premier and President-in-Office of the EU, Matteo Renzi, opposed to strong conservative opposition to the European Union's special summit last week, the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as a chief in EU foreign policy, you will be the successor of Britin Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, like the government newspaper La Repubblica, views his appointment as a favorite Mogherini in the government team as a favourite in terms of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost to his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes that he will also be quiet at the left party base, because Mogherini is associated with it - albeit in a moderate sense -.
Compared with the conservative representatives with the President of the Commission and with the Poland of Donald Tusk who were nominated as President of the Council, the prevailing opinion in Rome has resulted in a political balance.
The chief diplomat of the EU will, at the same time, be the deputy of the President of the Commission.
The agreement of the European Parliament which has yet to be approved is safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have mentioned the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) as an important acknowledgement of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica suggests that for almost two decades in leading party offices, Mogherini, known for its ambition, will be able to cope with the "enormous challenges." 
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left-Democrats), who in 2008 joined together with the Catholic Center Party Margherita to the present Social Democrat PD.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
With the election in 2001 at the Left of the Left Party, it went into a high party policy, it worked in foreign policy, its leader became soon.
They occupied traditional foreign policy such as the Middle East, and studies about NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved in a contingent of troops, established contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she is a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his Secretary of State.
If the PD once again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's more than 40% votes in the European elections in May, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in Federica Mogherini.
Recruitment in Brussels, which has too little diplomatic experience in Brussels, which is something it lacks in substance, is being worked out in the PD.
In Brussels, in particular by Poland and by the Baltic States, Mogherini's suspicious realistic accents to the crisis in Ukraine are being persecuted and diffused as a "sojourn course." 
It is in favour of the North Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company, Gasprom, which is intended to transport Russian gas directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine, also serving Italy's energy security.
After Renzi resigned as President of the EU in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first visit to Moscow.
Photos they had with Putin at Shake were enthusiastically received in Brussels, just as they invited the Kremlin leader for October to join a summit in Milan.

The socialists in France should "hold up and order France," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet is at odds with the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty and he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain at its side," he said with great applause.
As a appeasement gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government did not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite severe demands for a relaxation in the regulation of Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister for Economic Affairs, and the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, moved to the gearbox in which she appeared at a meeting of renegade socialist Members of the European Parliament, and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future." 
Marine Le Pen, the far right leader of the National Front, failed to meet the Socialists" constant struggle for burial, and said it could not imagine that the new Valls government was going to last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no one, they are forced to form a new government unless the old has survived a summer.
"and the new one will not survive autumn or winter," said milling versus support for Le Pen.
She repeated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident to come out as winner in early elections and be ready for government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat at the local elections in March and the National Front's right-wing National Front was held in the EU elections in May.
A survey in Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of collapsing into several rival groups before the end of Hollande's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences of Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and the number of trials.
"There is a little window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, NCHL.O, the third largest crusher in the world, is headed by experts in the field of advanced negotiations for the acquisition of the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships from Prestige Cruises, and its wealthy clientele, while larger rivals like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) compete.
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources on Sunday said, and they warned that the talks could also be fruitless.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also has a 20% share in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not answer at requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The company Norwegian based in Miami operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean Sea.
Its revenues amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, and 13% compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, is acting under the brand Oceania and Regent, which jointly run eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported earnings for 2013 of $1.2 billion, a 6% increase over the previous year.
The cruise industry is a total of around $29 billion, and in the next few years it is expected to be due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises requested the stock market in the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
In its current form in 2000, Norwegian Cruise was established in its present form in 2000 by a merger with a cross-vehicle contractor in the possession of Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay under control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June Genting held 28 per cent of the shares, Apollo 20 per cent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP a 8% share in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise, together with the original application documents for the stock market of Prestige Cruises, have 82 per cent of the passenger capacity for American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the electoral decision.
A pective group waved near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law which allows for only two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve a majority support for a nominating committee, which is likely to be filled with pinning-loyal members.
As a result of this decision, it becomes almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote, and pro-democracy activists have led them to face up to their threats and paralyse Hong Kong with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's party fear that the call for democracy is widening to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which set out in June the hegemony of China over Hong Kong, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands of people in the city of the city marched in and organised a sit-in there.
Lis's survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Office for the Affairs of Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei should be consulted in the course of the day.
Student activists announced to meet in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain had no democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to open "sovereign talks" with the eastern Ukraine.
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday, on Sunday, the Ukrainian government will stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country, and will begin immediately with negotiations on the "statality" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that under the control of the separatists, part of Russia, but that its status in relation to Ukraine needs to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to Kiev government to negotiations on par with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, is the strategy of the strategy for which he pursued, since the beginning of the riots of five months ago,: Aid for the separatists in joining countries and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossiya de facto independence for an alliance with Russia
In an interview with the State TV channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatist areas in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Peninsula to Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have referred in recent times to the "Novorossija" or" Neurussland,'' a concept that reminds us of the pre-revolutionary glory of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who attack civilian communities in civilian communities in territories held by separatists, who in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians in the elections on the 26th, and while government groups attack civilian communities in areas held by separatists, "in their illusions," are said to be caught up in their illusions, reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to begin a very comprehensive discussion not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society, and the state of the state of South-East, in order to maintain the interests of the people who live there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood should be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months from Kiev's leaders to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that have endangered their cultural and linguistic rights.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the Eastern areas the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
It is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because there is no conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine." 
The Kremlin's clarification of the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks highlighted the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, unlike the direct rise of Crimea, which the majority of 2 million people of ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls in advance of the conflict resulted in a broad majority to remain in Ukraine.
The autonomy raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects Russia's territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important commercial port and a historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his speech at his inauguration on 7 June, Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian legislation - following new elections - should take account of the Constitution, in which greater control over its finances and the status of languages is given to the relevant areas.
But his vision of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels who are being accused of arming and inciting Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatists at an eye has followed after another insistence of the rebels last week, after Russia's troops and tanks over the previously peaceful region of the Sea of Sea to the Ostuary.
The separatists supported by Russia, which according to the fears of Ukrainian security officials are the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, are the control of Nowoasovsk.
This is why massive civilian and military preparations are being made to support Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants who is between Nowoasovsk and narrow access to the Crimea peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and urgently asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are in front of a point where there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on specific actions; the leaders demanded further sanctions against Russia that should enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, said in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped in Ilowajsk by the Russian invasion of Russia were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parachuting hunters who had been arrested a week ago in Ukrainian territory, divided Lysenko on Sunday.
Nutfotoski for Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his annoyance about hackers, who are probably nuclei of his fiancake Gabi Grecko and a Who who who from Hollywood is stealing from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence has appeared in a hacker scandal about celebrities on the internet.
The hacker for this probably has more than 60 nude photos from Lawrence, Star of "Tribute of panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers of Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were allegedly made public on the basis of an iconography.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who died last month with Grecko, said to Confidential: "It is disgusting." 
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and shared with others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, says according to reports of a news website that Hack is "shameful" and that the people affected felt" hurt.''
The hacker is likely to have 30 pictures of Palmer with her former friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings, in which they are at the top of a pool.
"Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments about the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence said: "It is an odious violation of privacy." 
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "hacked pictures from a cellular phone is nothing other than the sale of Hehlerware." 
From a purely legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen pictures should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and hikers were supported yesterday at the 8th cycle in the field of Feldberg, thus supporting the "Help children" help for children.
The tour, which was one of one, was an easy training for the other.
In one, however, everyone agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of Oberurseler Brauhaus took place yesterday with the wheel on Feldberg.
For the good cause.
In addition to this, he can easily set off for the help of the small muscles of muscles, especially as the participation in the 8th cycle of cycling at the Grand Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for Creb-barrier children" (Frankfurt) has also brought a valuable insight into it.
It is a great thing.
"I know now that I can do that! '
Small glasses en route in the applause curve?
Snow, if I had stopped once, there was something like this?
As Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the city council of Upper Austria, was tortured many of the 718 participants yesterday in the spring to mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
By contrast, it was easier to overcome the good eleven kilometres between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
The green man in red - red dress in red - started at the start of something at the start ("Every amount of professional, there is the goal!), but after 45 minutes without breath, it proved to be at the top of the mountain and went to the finish after 45 minutes.
He is also driving the track in a slip like Nina Kuhn, pressesprecherin of the town of Oberursel, who had started off with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathlon athletes the field mines were not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about Charity, we are happy to have an exit we have already done today," Kuhn says.
On the way they had hit Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) came to Oberursel in the morning in the morning to put the height up again.
In the morning at 9 a.m. in the saddle in Frankfurt, the Frankfurter Florian Zierz swung at home in the saddle, "made" the field mountain two times and then with fun to home.
Fun was also called "Fritten-Toni." 
For the head of Oberurseler cult kiosks, bike tours over Feldberg are simply part of this.
He scored 40 minutes with his 6.5-kil-racing wheel.
It is a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to do it," Andreas Balzke said.
The trained motherboard tells us that it is an ambitious racetrack.
This is something he has to be, because he went to racing bikes, but there is no circuit.
The fact that it went without a wheel showed not only the 20 hikers who climbed up over the White Wall and the merger at the summit, but also a Jogger who, at a Kordel, got an authorization plate behind himself behind him.
Bergwacht said: "The kenn" from Frankfurt, which trains for a special sleigh track, means that it's the sling of itself.'' So the man is in a sense of his own sled.
The 718 participants, who are as many as before, had been sent to groups in groups in the morning.
The trekkers will be taken at 9.30 a.m
The first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m. followed.
Five minutes later the first mountain bike came loose.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association of Radeln in the Great Feldberg, gave the starting command and desired a nice trip to the participants.
For next year, he hopes that the route to Feldberg can be closed up to the safety of the participants.
