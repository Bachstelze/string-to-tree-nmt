Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes to see a contract for defence cooperation between the two nations.
Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the rider had driven it with 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic policemen in Karratha tried this morning to stop a blue motorcycle after they watched it, as it left 125 km/h to leave a petrol station at the Bathdate Road.
The police reported that the driver ignored the stops and went on to Burgess Road before he crashed into the bushland where the officials lost it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who was responsible for the description of the driver were later seen in a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accuse a 20-year-old man of non-compliance with a holding and reckless driving.
He is expected to appear in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.

Reference to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have submitted a proposal for a law in order to establish the organization of unions as citizen rights.
"As unions die, middle-class jobs die," said Ellison, a Democrat of Minnesota and vice-chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud to present the Civil Code of Personnel together with the Mayor of John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law provides workers with the same legal opportunities that exist in relation to the organization of labor unions, as is the case of other forms of discrimination.
The addition of the national law on labour law to create an opportunity for discrimination against workers in order to organise union representation in order to complain to a civil court of justice, and to obtain compensation or punishment is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative, at least not to American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill propose is the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have suffered in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries around the country, Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, expand and respect labor rights.
There was a time for millions of Americans to remember when that country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his team encouraged him to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy would replace Hedki Tojos with democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions have a role to play in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "the rights of workers are guaranteed in association and joint bargaining and acting." 
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would mean that fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers should organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly said: "the right to establish associations in order to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to everyone and to any profession or profession.
Agreements that limit or limit this right are null and void; measures that target them are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was drafted by the Universal Declaration on Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form unions to protect his interests or join them." 
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that human rights are human rights.
When that country joined other countries how to form forms of civil and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to establish a union - and that this union should then be protected as an equal partner as an equal partner with companies and government agencies.
Indeed, after launching these rights in America, it is very wise to remember the American ideal, so that the working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.
How Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the nation's strength, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for the industry and increased the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history keeps them.
History is reminiscent, and that is something we should do.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America big in the past and have brought about the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporarily that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force the closure to close.
On Sunday, a US judge stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, from which lawyers said that it would probably have led to the closure of all the five abortion clinics of the state.
This measure, which was raised by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June, to enter into force on the 1st of September, would force doctors who carry out abortions to acquire a patient reception at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that doctors will continue to carry out legal abortions as they apply for such a right.
"The plaintiffs may continue to work in accordance with the law when they seek to obtain these rights," Federal judge John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing is scheduled for the judge in order to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Pro-abortion advocates welcomed the decision taken in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors would take so much time to gain the rights of hospital.
"The decision taken today means that the women in Louisiana will escape a malicious law that they want to take into account their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President, and Chairman of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately obvious whether the judgment was also extended to doctors from the two clinics who did not join the lawsuit and had also requested permission to file.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have issued similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key institutions of a law in Texas, which forced most of the clinics that remained in the state were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, have conceded that doctors' right to expulsion requires unnecessary restrictions.
Anti-abortion opponents believe that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some also welcome the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who has carried out abortions in Louisiana has a doctor who has patients of patients who have the rights of reproductive rights.
If all of the other doctors in the state do not have to carry out abortions, that doctor would no longer carry out the surgery out of fear of his safety, and the group said.
In their arguments against the ruling, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, while their applications for cases of patient acceptance would be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates caused by ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James placed a video record for their mother online, which died in 2007 on ovarian cancer.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than it is for women in urban areas.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women, where ovarian cancer was detected in 2005 and it was discovered that only 25% of five years after diagnosis were still alive.
The research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDIE: New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman influenced the chances of survival in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-treatment, and social and economic status.
For older women and those whose cancer had advanced at the point of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote areas, the risk of death was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not study why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a belated diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
In spite of the improvement of telemedicine services, in order to accommodate the distances, it proposed an improvement of the service of certified doctors to provide specialists with the possibility of providing women with a growing number of women and treatment programs for people outside of their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographic status, the study revealed a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and emphasized the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Horticultures are sorry for falling home ownership
The fall in decline with an increase in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 could cause gardens to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach a study of the HTA as reported in the Financial Times to reach the "core age group group for garden products." 
The report says that tenants spend 55% of the amount that people spend with home for their garden.
The growth of people who live in highly urbanized areas without gardens, popular procedures, pre-gardens for parking and are falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry that is estimated at £5 billion a year in sale.
In the area of London where, over a period of six years, the share of homeowners has fallen from 61% to 43%, the lowest expenditure for horticultural products per household will be reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that accommodation for rent or small gardens does not mean that people are unable to draw plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Consultant for the RHS, said: "Container nurseries are very popular among tenants because they can take their plants with them when moving." 
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the horticultural retail trade from the late 1980s to the middle of the 1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Spiritual Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators have stepped up the state television channel of PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protestors back from PTV buildings.
The station was running its operation for about 40 minutes, but it was sent back in the meantime.
At the same time, around 3000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometre away from them, they provided themselves with sticks and stones equipped clashes with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators called for Sharifs's resignation, but he rejects that.
Meanwhile, the country's army is calling for a political solution to the conflict without wasting time and using force without force." 
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role to ensure the security of the state." 
The military plays an important role in Pakistan, and has been used more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuse Premier Sharif that parliamentary elections were cheated in May last year.
The protests were escalating at the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to invade Sharifs Residenz.
Three people were killed.
Turkey ordered by US diplomat for a report on espionage
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed the former US diplomat of the country with a report on US and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the managing director of the US embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries had been spied on each other.
A previous report that targeted Ankara was also targeted at Ankara's main secret service, providing for significantly angry reactions from the Turkish Government.
Warning Watchers: Train drivers are threatened with consequences for commuters.
The federal public warning controversy of the organisers on Monday evening could also affect the movement of people in NRW.
The exhibition stand announced for 18 to 21 hours covers all transport companies, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn (city rail) traffic.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the movement of goods.

Said the district chair of the Trade Union of the Trade Union of the German Railways (GDL), Sven Schmid, in Düsseldorf.
We expect that to happen.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the transport of goods.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it will do everything it can to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where she wanted to strike, so that it was difficult to anticipate the consequences concretely.
Indicting Magaluf of Coraluf
On Friday, the prosecutors submitted evidence of blackmail to the office of the public prosecutor of Mallorca by the police and the employees of the City of Calvià.
The head of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption charges of businessmen and barbers in the notorious binding drink of Magaluf.
The main Commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, was arrested on corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs are in Magaluf.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented the office of the public prosecutor for combating the corruption of Mallorca on Friday evidence of blackmail by the police and the employees of the City of Calvià.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with corruption charges and are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that angry night goers said that the government's cronies have a major impact on their business.
"It is no longer a matter of earning money, it is about survival," one of the businessmen said to the court.
Let us leave our lives out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer, Magaluf made international headlines in this summer because of a viral YouTube-Videos in which an 18-year-old British tourist who performed in 24 men during a tour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the illegal behaviour of non-alcoholic tourists in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants to the notorious alcoholic drinks.
The Playhouse Club, where the fur case was held, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the tavern Carnage have to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73.000).
The resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular among young British tourists, is also known for a number of accidents involving alcohol, including the "Balconing" trend in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first spring date with wet weather conditions and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport.
The spring has brought a lot of winter surprises to the south of the island, with strong winds and strong winds, impacting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening to 21: 00 to 21/7, it was possible to leave the city again, after 6,6mm, which had already been dropped down to Sunday in the night.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormic shrubs, including a bite that began shortly before 20 a day ago and caused almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
When winter last week had caused an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city on Monday fell to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C
The bad weather conditions are likely to lead to the late landing of Virgin Airlines' flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7.30 p.m., but it was taken by a scout wind - a sudden change of wind speed or direction over a short distance - and it had to go through.
At that point the wind reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to run through during a second landing flight and was finally suspended at 20.40.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas from Sydney.
For Adelaide is predicted on Tuesday a maximum temperature of 16 ° C, with possible showers.
Matthies says: At the highest time, it is high time to kill.
In view of the technical progress that is threatening to turn our cosy home into high-tech switches, our columnist Bernd Matthies comes with a very familiar electronic accessory.
While I write here, my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone, and I think: Boah, as retro is that?
But there is one thought behind it: If the cable would not be, all listeners would fly around the house in the shortest possible time, and that would be a lot more retro.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
No, typos: Electronic) sector is the rule that is the novelty of today the electric scrap of tomorrow - has been bought -
And anyone who, for example, has a tube in the living room today just says that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressure from the Ifa at Funkturm this week again gives us our total incompetence in matters of electronics.
The Laie, who used to blindly control the machine and the CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that will be spread with unfathomable expert spreaders in front of him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" the press office will promise us.
Indeed, is it still possible?
What are we talking about talking to people who apparently voluntarily spread such Quark?
After all, for about 20 years we have been trying to network our house.
In order for us to see the yoghurt itself, telling us that the fire alarm in the holiday in Maldives tells us that it burns in the room of work.
And would it not be wonderful if we were to leave the office from the office out of the air conditioning to our early arrival?
Yes, that requires air-conditioning.
But a dream will definitely come true soon: We lift up our wristwatch, say it according to "Saugen!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner is going off.
Misleading.
All that happens is nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred," raven up a branch of the industry, you can connect the washing machine with a headphones, the steam garer sends the weather report and the data briefs show how long the pizza needs to cook in the oven, but is useless because we stand in the ground
We also know from everyday practice: If a modern equipment is really needed urgently, the battery is empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio shows.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas close to Gaza returned to schools on Monday after they spent the summer in the air when they had spent their summer in the air when rocket and murderers of their communities invaded their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and closed the schools in Gaza, and the area was recovering from the fighting.
The school launch has given Israel a sense of joy and expectation to the southern part of Israel, but the signs of the fighting are fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the staff of the "Pashosh" nursery who was hit by a rocket, in front of the meeting of the student grenade shears from the walls and slides.
"We have a bit of fear, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, a friend of Kibbutz Saad and her English teacher.
Many children from our area desperately need the return to a routine.
Their 11-year-old daughter Shani said it feels "a bit funny" to go back to school.
"These were difficult times and we did not go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin attended the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza in order to offer its support.
Until a cease-fire broke down last week, thousands of residents of the border communities, such as Saad in their houses, left their homes in order to move away from Gaza in safer areas and escape from Gaza, and murderers to escape.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality close to the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer grenade, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not returned.
Their children were provisionally accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza that was badly drawn from the Palestinian attack.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "We will make sure that their knowledge acquires knowledge and provide security." 
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an open-ended ceasefire.
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting; however, major problems remain unresolved, as was the demand of Hamas for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and for the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel is calling for a disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of civilians were killed, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these claims and estimates that they are at least half of those combatants, but they did not provide any concrete evidence of that information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other combatants in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar shells while fighting in Israeli cities, most of which are in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza region and about 250,000 people were seeking refuge in over 100 UN schools that have been converted into temporary protection rooms.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protected areas and the fighting continues, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school is open soon so that we can learn more how the children in the world and Jewish children said," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl calls into question NPD-prohibition procedures.
In view of the vote losses of the NPD in Saxony, CDsubmarine Thomas Strobl spoke out in front of the Federal Constitutional Court for an end to the current NPD-prohibition procedure.
Berlin - There should be an end to the ongoing ban on NPD in front of the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is worse than the last time," said Strobl, who also is CDU-Landeschef in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the" Leipziger Volkszeitung.''
That is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
In the vote on Sunday, the NPD failed in the vote of the five-percent threshold.
A first attempt at a ban on the far-right party was failed in 2003 because the protection of the Constitution was also in the NPM lead.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after lengthy preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join forces.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
Refugees are now staying in tents at the end of the day.
The head office for refugees in Harburg burst out of all the seams.
Now the internal body has put together three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The local politicians were informed only briefly - they were a little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck campaigns continue to fuel citizens" reservations and give district politicians no way to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees,'' says Britta Herrmann, Chairman of the Green Party in the Harburg District Assembly.
Your party requires that the Harburg District Administration is currently providing unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees may be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for filling up in the initial picture are the rush of help seekers - and the fact that the authorities can not provide sufficient places in downstream institutions
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
Home prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP-data from Monday.
The increase is the overall increase in June, July and August at 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than double the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The Research Director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, has said that Sydney and Melbourne drive a two-tier market.
The figures of RP Data show that the home prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, compared to 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, in which prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government spending, was hit when prices rose by 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lavless said that with the spring season would now be observed for the coming months an increase in the real estate that would be subjected to the market, which would undergo `a real test '.
"When you consider the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rate, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of the Managing Director, Peer Medau, and attests to this `how to pose a field '.
The style of the university is not, it says in the communication.
The Medau family was already informed about the request of the university in the middle of June.
The statement that the plans were only known in July are definitely wrong." 
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not `preconceived or even decisions', but are` preferences'.
Also the construction of the narrow road needed to access the castle was less dramatic than feared by the Meda.
Of a road that was nine metres wide, it was not mentioned.
It is currently at 5.50 meters, it is a metre wider than before," Pügen explains.
The argument of the Medau operator that their free and compulsory parking spaces in the future will only be used by students of the university will not be allowed to be counted.
It will not be parked at all because this can be solved intelligently as is the case with other public car parks.
Thinking about the people who live in the Middle East
The children crab, which is located on the premises and will lead to the parking deck in front of their door, is not supposed to be affected by the university president.
On the contrary, it should be borne in mind that this is not just the birth of children, but also the people who live in the surrounding area at the birth of the Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring Realschule.
In other words, it is a question of much more than special interests of the lords of Medau '.
Whether the criticism of the child's nativity of the child's cron, with the development of the street, would be entitled "the few natural stains of Coburg," the reader may" decide for himself.''
At the beginning of October the town of Bamberg wants to inform the town councillors about the development of the university by 2020.
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the kindergarten last week about the university's plans.
Thus the access to the new park deck should not be carried over through the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but rather through the Medau mountain.
This is the reason why the narrow road should be expanded over a kilometre of length.
According to the calculations of the Medaus, traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels was ten-fold.
There is talk of approximately 2000 vehicles a day.
The town was not intended to speak about the project.
Glandorf comes back from the national team of handball teams.
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the national league of SG Flensburg-Handewitt had a number of health problems in mind.
The decision has not been easily taken, it has matured over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to finish my career in the national team," the 2007 World Champion announced on his Facebook page.
In this way he deals with a balance sheet of 167 countries and 576 gates for Germany in the international retirement.
He is no longer available to the new Federal Trainer Dagur Sigurdsson because the massive backroom players who win the Champions League of Flensburg will no longer be able to go out to Torehunting for a number of years.
With the Icelanders who were visiting Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf called Glandorf a long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have impressed me just as much as they will inspire my longtime mates and my successors.
But for my club I want to be healthy in the next few years, for which longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which do not allow the current double load.
In 2012, the link box had to fear his career.
Because of the problems he had encountered, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handballbunder (DHB) with a cortisonspritze which had later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further operations followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor who ended the dispute with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional career and eleven years of national career do not pass through a body.
I have some health sites that I can not ignore
After the three cases of infection that occurred in 2012 in short intervals, I have never managed to get to grips with my blood pressure.
In this respect, there are a number of other veiled complaints.
Even at the beginning of the year, I noticed that I was able to control my head, but my body is unable to deceive," Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine "Handball Time.''
To make a comeback, he would only be available in an absolute emergency.
"When all tear up, I am always willing to talk," explained the two-fold family father of the magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can play handball.
I also have to say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012, I have become rather humble when it comes to my health.
After my career I want to go at least to some extent.
In addition to the WM-Titel 2007 and the win of the Champions League 2014, he took 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and in 2010 (TBV Lemgo) to the EHF-Pokal.
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup Winner with Flensburg.
The German economy of the spring shrunk by 0.2%
The crises around the world have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the prior quarter by 0.2 percent.
This was done by the Federal Statistical Office, confirming preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone animated the economy in the spring, while the investment declined.
Foreign trade, too, has slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual event, the first half of the year will result in a GDP increase of 0.8 percent in comparison with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland Moolist" which led to the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar on Sunday experienced an invasion of the Dutch "Fietzenriders." 
The biggest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Moolist." 
It is the biggest bicycle tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked themselves with their registration in Jos, Huerne, for the organization of this round trip through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested exhibitors in a variety of magazines.
We come from Den Helder and have gone overnight to take part in this tour.
We want to get to know the Münsterland again in this way," the cyclists enjoyed the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club of the Sagittarius Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the Wall, where also started.
Further, the route that was put out for three different categories led towards Herrenholz over the Schöppinger mountain towards Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 km with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 km with 1475 height metres and 145 km with 1775 meters have proven their good condition.
They were cultivated en route in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer of Jos and the mayor of Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization ran without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, the number of participants was not so many as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to bad weather forecasts and morning rain.
"We look back in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on 30 August or another weekend," nevertheless the cyclists promised to return to the Münsterland and the organizers planned a new edition.
Konstantin wake up honest memoirs mercilessly.
It is actually more philosophical testimony as biography, which has brought Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political certainties activist, ex-prisoner, into "Mönch and Warrior" on 287 pages of paper.
His memoirs have been added to his memoirs on June 1, 1947, and each chapter is marked by a matching song text.
And he is ruthless and honest: From the Onanie as a high school to shoplifting and drug abuse, he does not leave a human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in his dealings with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also take abstract, but the more important terms are one: Love, soul, ego, the existence in the now, spirituality - all that he seeks to go to the ground, to very philosophical, but also in a very personal manner.
He also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also, how he has influenced not only music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also stay his prison.
The latter has also brought the living man, Konstantin Wecker, closer to the asketic monk who is born "by subtraction," as he says," leaving everything to be removed.''
Between all the highly spiritual views, there are also short anecdotes about the earths: For example through thugs in one frequented by GIs or a crazy trip in which he targeted a tree.
He is also ruthless about that.
Lenny Henry: My father has never taken me into the arm.
Has never said "I love you
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in 1958.
His father who died when Henry 19 was working in a factory and relationship was limited.
Henry rehearsed for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of Reggae and Rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through a number of difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship to his father.
It was difficult to know him.
You never saw his face, only his voice heard: "höll with the collar.
Leave your sister in peace.
Walk away!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went to the bar and spoke about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life was he this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than that of his father, he gained a glimpse of how life might have been for him.
It is a bit brighter now, but they are dark, rough, deep stygic labyrinths with flame retardants and smoke and lots.
My father simply put himself into the bathtub and then heard him slowly how he started to sing, because he was able to wash the foundry.
When I went around, I realized that he had done that for years to put the food on the table, and my respect for him was greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew as a child without his parents' love gifts.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you." 
Only when my mother at the end of her life went ill, we began to say "I love you, I love you, I love you." 
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missing as a child.
Could you stop with "I love you" ?
Listen to me to get rid of me!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mother.
It is still a friend of France who was married to him for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mother.
Henrys's own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I was very, very important and symptoms of diabetes showed, my doctor said "You have to be radical.
So I pulled this fitness and had to take a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is a lot of effort.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henrys's career in career may be shown in his elegant short cut bar.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been captured by the theatre.
It followed the comedy of the verses, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is another experience than the Sitcoms and comedies that have filled his business working life.
He started only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people, and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s. "I was the only black Imitator/Comedian on television for a rather long time." 
He learned in the profession.
I had to learn not only from public opinion, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient Witz narrative machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
When his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people of "black anmold," Henry introduced his comedy there over five years.
The staff was very friendly and helpful.
I wish somehow that it might never happen, but I do not regret that I have done it.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a" grotesque parody'' of black people." 
Through the introduction of figures that celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked in the eighties at an alternative community.
The first series of the lenny Henry show went on show in 1984, and in the 90s he was known among others as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series boss.
After his BBC series, LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought: "What do you do next, Len, because it is all you feel like you are just the time to take the time it is." 
Then a documentary series for Radio 4 came with the title What's So Great About?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was actually allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never learned anything about him at school and held him mostly for a domain of middle class, whites in tights and a carbon head in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
All who we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, said Judi Dench said "You should try it once.
Do not make it bad if you do not know what you are doing.
Take a few words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare so dear.
Henry ran 20 lines from Othellos's last speech for the documentary and was enthusiastic.
I had the feeling that I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
"That is what it is, it is a serious thing, they take your text seriously, researched a bit.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that simply did not happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy comedy.
Suddenly I was in the national theater and I could not believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed you." 
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me" you have to bridge ten minutes while fixing the computer." 
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea would continue when the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and anything in me said, "Oh, thank God." 
I am not responsible.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You play in a play, so you stick in your role." 
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, and that strengthens the people.
That also came well, it is like a big sign of the gods who tell me "This is your destiny." 
He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.
So I stand by it.
I really love that.
I love to be in a sample room.
However, Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is crossed by humorous outbursts as he imitates people over and over again.
I have decided not to make a booth comedy because I believe that this kind of immediate satisfaction is somehow dangerous from a room full of strangers.
If you look for it forever, you drive a wall.
I sometimes perform live in the Apollo when I want to do it, but I do n't like it as much as I used to.
I ask him if he will ever make a stand-up comedy tour.
The fun I have in a space with a director who helps the beginning, a middle section and the end of a journey - I do not think I want to give up again.
Is that, then, its new incarnation?
I think so.
I am happy to be an actor.
It is fun.
One is always told a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels blocking streets in Yemen's Capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni Government, the Huthis called the Huthis to civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi-followers had occupied central roads in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman of the Huth party "Ansar Allah." 
The access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media report about a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper, Huthi-leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on Sunday evening to take the measures.
Huthi, according to the sheet, threatened further escalation of the conflict, and his claims should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni Yemen, and are calling for the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
There are around 30,000 rebels who have built protest camps in the large entrance to Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya Registered Public Employers in order to Protect Employee
Kenya has started to register all state officials in order to delete "clerers" from government pay lists.
Staff who do not register for the next two weeks would no longer be paid.
The government thought that thousands of people were still receiving salaries after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service in 2013.
In a review at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least EUR 1 million (GBP 700,000) was lost per month to payments for "ghost workers" and through other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be paid out to accounts after a person died or leaves the public service, reporting Wanyama Chebusiri to the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will have to appear in the next two weeks at identification centres in order to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are received.
Anyone who would not do so without a credible apology was removed from the salary list.
"By doing so will make a major contribution to the rationalisation of the public service by determining the actual number of officials, and will also settle the pay list at both levels of government - thus the" ghost workers" will be eliminated, "said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal of the art adviser Helge Achenbach will be held in court on 11 November.
Five of the heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi-founder Theo Albrecht, demand compensation from Achenbach and two of his companies which are involved in insolvency proceedings in a civil process at the Düsseldorf District Court.
This was shared by a lawyer on Monday.
In the lawsuit, Achenbach said that when he bought works of art and vintage cars, Berthold was charged with higher prices of goods that were actually paid.
That meant that the agreed commission was higher.
Achenbach bought 121 million euros of value for Albrecht.
Children Need Roots and Boats
He was educated at school for 44 years, of which 23 were teachers.
From that period, Manfred Richter knows many of Peter Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his quest to see people in the student.
The snow is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves painting with the motif of his home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
He was educated at the age of 14 after four years of secondary school.
One year later the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour the family had to leave the house.
After several months in one camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946.
That was the reason why it was the judge who was forced to go to the Lower Franconian valley.
The training of teachers took place in Bamberg.
In order to do this, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometers to the next railway station six times a week, travel by train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the whole city and return to the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a Rot-Kreuz-Home in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 people in a sleeping room.
In 1951, he made the first, after three years of teaching, the second state examen, after three years of teaching.
As Oberfranken had no free apprenticeship for him, he looked after Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "milling room" room was his first" apartment'' in the school house.
In 1958, he was referring to a three-room service apartment in addition to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then there were in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach three classes and five in Petershausen.
From the school year of 1968/69 they were grouped together in Petershausen in the present town hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only primary primary school remained in the area.
In order to avoid a downgrade in the smaller school, the then rector, Georg Sigl, changed to Karlsruhe - and Manfred Richter who became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and thus, from September 1982, the children and their teachers were able to obtain the present construction, which was extended to judge retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor, Ludwig Götz, who was built on municipal fees in addition to a workshop room and the expansion of 1997 cellar rooms, although that was not eligible for the directives on school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," judge reminded himself.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a member of the government who had responded to a school council about law and fairness: "We must never forget the love." Manfred Richter put forward what he had heard of him as a young teacher.
"It is necessary to give children two things: Roots and wings," says the 84-year-old.
He had to learn, and he had to learn: "It's not always possible to do so." Whether he meant his students, or also his own six children, is not entirely clear.
In any case, judge sometimes was unconventional.
When students check in, they did not get a criminal work and have not been beaten up by him.
At the expense of the parish, judge had created two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two counterparties stand up against each other, even if there was one thing to do.
For the good of the school, judge used a good relationship to the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
He moved the party-less judge after his retirement, in 1996, at least as a last on the list of councils for the municipal council.
But Richter was elected to six and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists lay out in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten stopovers.
When Radler makes a trip to Bad Salzhausen or Scots, that is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of Rastende impressions was made: The 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break at the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later had a party under the open sky in the Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "cycling and celebrating on newly discovered trails between Nidda and Kinzig," the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and experienced a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: The cyclist took the first stage, which took 60 km above Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and continued to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, athletes were welcomed by mayors who took part in Bad Vilbel by bicycle and the head office of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For refreshment of body and soul, all manner of good things had been prepared: The peasant women from Ranstcity and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, kennel, litter and cheese cake that wonderfully meditated to the skilled cyclists.
"These cakes can only bake land women," he praised a participant from Aulendiebach while holding another piece.
Cold refreshments could be found at the refreshment booth of the fair.
The "duo Bravo" taught the visitor with famous melodies of operettas and musicals and experienced enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also had a head massage from his partner: "He earned him, and finally he has already fixed a series of bicycle chains that have already been blown up." 
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: They were interviewed at the fountain in front of the reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Since the first hr4-Radtour 2004 as a tour leader in 2004, Tobias Hagen has also spent a lot of time to do this, as he had done a lot of the technique to do on site.
His pick up pressure, in which he communicated with three phones and a radio with his staff, communicated to the police in Hessen with his staff, and where he communicated to the police of the state of Hesse, wrote facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region," he said," also coming from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from numerous cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends on the accommodation capacity available.
In category I will host the participants in hotels, in Category II in class accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up after a year and a half: "Chüss!" 
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" 
After the arrival in Scots, the group was allowed to pause a brief pause.
But in the evening the cyclists were required to take part in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had a nice festive atmosphere and of course it had prepared treats, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner in his function as a member of the Executive Board of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased about the "many operations in Scots." 
DJ Tobias Hagen then gave the dance stage.
The occasion to be gay was used in the open air in spite of the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests there were increasing numbers of people who were pleased by the good mood, as did the great people of cyclists.
On the second day the stations of Birstein, Guarditersbach and Bad Orb, including a concert with the Trenkwalders, stood on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 km of cycling, athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish policemen due to "conspiracy" to arrest the government
A total of 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of the "plot against the government," local media agencies report.
The police authorities did not make a direct comment.
There are 14 high-ranking policemen who were arrested.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers, last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they were founded organized criminal union and tapped phone numbers.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was the prime minister at the time) described her as a part of the activities that are led by the Islamist cleric cleric based on manure and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost across Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
He told waiting journalists that not all schools had opened up, but that he was determined to defend the land for future generations:
The Septemberheld were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a vast common Ukrainian folk front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, School Director of the School in Slawjansk who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke about Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in further life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, and the children wear embroidered shirts, hold ballons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud glory from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tor party.
And it has its own front-end experience.
Her career began with the global management consultancy Bain and Co., which changed her to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top position of the mother company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their removal was supposed to have been almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also sound.
She was advised by Lord Browne, the former Chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: She was appointed to the adviser in the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former member of Tory.
Even in May, I described the role of the Chairman with a poisoned Kelch.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust has a two-pronged effect: The inside to the first guard of its own Managementhian hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside voice as a voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong.
That makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires full comprehensive reform.
But whatever incoming president would risk, stand up to go on everything, and divide an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may be doing his job himself.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that were not enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC shrunk - power, money and status.
While the competition moves closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable guarantees, the forthcoming negotiation of licence fees is linked to special dangers.
For the modest amount of 145.50 £per year, the British public is buying itself into the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: It says that it reaches 96% of households and costs only 40 pence per day.
And it seems that the BBC is up in popularity again: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits of the BBC have changed: I get news lines these days on my mobile phone and I see fit programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and distinguished institution.
It needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found it.
Perry of Texas says that lowering tweet was not authorised to authorize.
A Tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a beleaguered remark about the democratic councillor who is at the heart of a criminal prosecution against him for abuse of authority.
The Tweet was deleted later, and was replaced by another of Perrys's account, which was removed from the previous one.
A tweet has been sent from my account which was not authorised by me.
"I do not approve of the Tweet and have deleted him," he said in the future message.
Employees of Perry did not answer immediately on requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perl's official account went out, it was not clear who was actually serving the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavourable picture of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, which was sentenced in April 2013, was drawn up in April 2013.
Perry put forward a veto against financial promotion of its offices when she refused to resign what might have been an indictment of Perry - which may be the 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweets reads: "I do not always drink drunk with the triple permissible alcohol mirror but when I do it, I recommend Governor Perry if he is chilling." 
I am the most hated democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the control of the study of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-standard team of lawyers applied in the case of the case to reject the indictment, arguing that the law with which Governor's oldest governor is employed in the history of the state of Texas is imprecise.
Perry stopped 7.5 million dollars of government funds to the Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County, and in cases of state corruption was identified in Texas as Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint on the part of a leftwing watchdog group.
Perl's official account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed his presidential candidacy in 2012 during his presidential candidacy in 2012, Perry went on to speculate that he was going to stop by sending a tweet of a photograph of himself in the vicinity of a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!" 
Berkeley explains housing market again for "normal" 
One of the most prominent construction companies in London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had returned to a normal level.
Homes in the capital were hotter and subject to enormous price increases as the Bank of England learned because of the widespread fear of a credit bubble to set limits on mortgage credit in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the highest in 2013" and added that this is a" stable way of action.''
The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pressed into the capital.
According to information from the Katowice Office, prices in the urban area rose by 18.5% last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average sales prices at Berkeley's private, cheap and student offers increased by about one-fifth of the year and were at the end of April around the 423,000 £.
However, over the past few months, property ownership in London has made it less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric in advance of the general election in May of next May.
The London estate agency Foxton warned last week that in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April, in which stricter lending rules were introduced, would also lead to lower market growth in property sales as was the case at prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday indicate a fall in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the housing market has cooled down.
Hamptions International, another real-estate agency, corrected its prediction of the rise in property prices in London to 3% in 2015, on the basis of an economy that is already weakening.
The volume of transactions in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington, has fallen year after year by a quarter, so the broker is WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the wish for a home in the capital of the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts owed amount to £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and remained stable as a result." 
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost one third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax income increased by 40 percent each year to €280 million, accounting for 18 percent to €1.6 billion.
In a Communication on Monday before the Annual General Meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgley said that the income for Berkeley in the current year is expected to meet current market expectations.
Analysts estimate that the annual pre-tax income is €450 million.
In the afternoon in London, Berkeley shares stood up at 23.96 £.
Naked pictures of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscar winner.
Naked pictures of the Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star of "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were authentic and used the hacker because" flagrant violation of privacy.''
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who continue the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
In addition to that, some of the photos that were originally posted on the photo sharing site 4chan were reported by a gap in the online storage system icloud was obtained from Apple, which includes the alleged "master list" that includes dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Wenger and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported Buzzfeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are authentic, although Wish, Star of "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter, also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I recorded years ago in the private environment of our home - I hope you are so happy with you," wrote Wengen on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and" Victive'' however denied that it was in the photos of pictures of her and tweetete "These so-called nude pictures of me are falsified people.
Let us take care of the fact that we are fighting for the beginning.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a spokesman of the popstar Ariana Grande offset the authenticity of the supposed photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly praised novel on love and the letter "J." 
They have been torn apart, so it was possible to describe it best, they were dissolved slowly like a box that was left in the rain.
Occasionally a woman said to him that he was too serious, demanding, intensively distancing himself, and perhaps somewhat scratching it.
And shake hands with him.
He knew how to scratch him.
He was stony, as was in Igel, yea.
The last victim of this confusion was an incipient affair that was more promising to relieve the lonely boredom of his life, and might even have brought him a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a treacherous beauty with unheard hair and a flattering heart of a village on the North Island that was even remote and was warmed up as port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older escort who held the Kevern for her aunt, inheriting a land in a wet but heavenly valley with the true name of Paradise Valley.
Over several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leck, the baths were spinning, neck necks had left their marks on all the windows and they thought they were one of them, and the garden was watched with weeds that looked like huge cabs.
It was like the house of a children's fairytale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of mystery.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands at the Longlist for the Man Booker Award 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern, who had been chatting with Ailinn, had enjoyed the broken deck chairs in the high grass and had enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon that caused the land of soothing music and soothing news, as the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old track of a long-forgotten black entertainer, to whom his father was happy to dance with closed shutters.
Your feet are too large.
Because of their own aggression, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Nothing was forbidden - nothing was correctly forbidden - simply was not played.
It has been successfully rendered obsolete as the word becomes obsolete.
The general taste of what rules and regulations would never have achieved and how the people with books choose the Vom-Telleraqua-m-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks, and love novels have been chosen, so they chose ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and began to wear great feet in a huge comic that had taken place.
Ailinn did not understand that.
"That was a well known song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he explained her and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
That was what his father had always done to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father had played him with his own father, so he had told him.
If you take a word with a J start without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was not a very funny game then and it was not very funny now.
He knew that he was expected to do so, and that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any of them.
Jazz, even if he was not directly prohibited, was not played.
The improvising was no longer fashionable.
It was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be safe at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
That is what the reason is.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew anything about jazz from the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he did not need to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At age she was unable to remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Once again, no laws or constraints were applied.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of the group - thanks to its fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were fit for entertainment and sports through temperament and body construction, and thus ran and ran them.
People who originally came from the Indian sub-continent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were engaged in the task to ensure that no family remained without a working service.
What was left of the Polish community was concerned about the canalisation; what was left of the Greeks was torn down.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly when they had left the country when WAR was going to do WAR, which was called WAR, did happen to WAR out of fear of being accused of fire, fearing that the flames would eat them next - they had to
Each according to his abilities.
As she had only heard ballads, Ailinn was hard to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could be made more expensive.
Music was an expression of love.
"These are not really insulting," Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father has never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He was too much, but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security.
There was nothing to overcome the soundproofing of the enormous carbon leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why should your father love that?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers to the lips in its present time.
She already thought that he was rather odd.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head and blocked his head view.
Around the world, there was nothing else to see when it was a bit of rabid black hair.
There was nothing he would have expected to have seen.
"If you say," I say to them without conviction.
But that does not explain why you present it to me.
It seemed to be honest about it.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not so direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit of good?
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
You hate them?
Of course I do not hate you.
That is just the silly song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early to do so.
"Your thick ankles are precisely the reason why you satisfy me," he tried it instead.
I am a bit perverse.
That did not sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often put himself in trouble because, like his father, he did not have the comforting charm that was needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be Kevern, that was.
In spite of its kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was red and grew up from her deckchair, threw the console and swallowed the wine she had drank.
Wood of wood, that is to say, was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, as Palmwedel appeared in the storm.
"And your thickness is exactly the reason why I feel drawn to you," she said.
In addition to that, I am not at all.
She was fed up with him because of the unnecessary uneasiness of his words, as well as the fear that was shown in her eyes when she rejected himself against him.
Was she thought he would beat them?
She had not told him of life in the cold northern archipelago where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as it was here.
The same enormous and icy ocean broke up here as they did at the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and drive-like after DEM did WAR as it had been their ancestors as smugglers and lipids, went by bars to pub, always prepared to collect the hand against a woman who refused or swallowed them.
Thickness?
They would have shown a thick fist if they did not fit in!
You only stumbled - the most frequently used word was for an erotic attraction between men and women, which was an antidote to the empty love ballads from the console - they first kneaded and then beat.
It was an unnecessary refinement when it was felt that this was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign of his body.
He arose from a deckchair like an old man.
They also felt dead, but their grief surprised them.
That was not the end of the world.
They did not know each other.
She looked to him how he removed himself, just as from a room at the top of the floor was her companion - a man who complained by something that he himself summoned.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought her.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her to wear his back, his back was ashamed, it was ashamed, defeat, without fighting spirit - why that was a sight that she seemed to know if she could n't remember a single time when she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
For many years to come, ESME Nussbaum, a intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for public sentiment, was working on a short talk about continued violence at low and medium-sized levels in precisely the parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, were most likely to be expected in the light of the funds and energy that had been invested in eradicating this violence
"There has been a lot of work, and much has to be done," she wrote to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that led to thousands of wars, and most of them have won, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the land where the sweet breath of human kindness was rarely felt in spite of the lofty cherry towers between the hedges
But some features turn out to be inevitable.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion it continues to inspire.
The people crying when hearing sentimental ballads have taken a look at stories of exaggerated difficulties and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless not only the past raw of rural communities, as well as our urban fabric, stand up in their hands, but also provide evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious dispute at home, in the workplace, in the streets, and
"She has an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said when he had read the whole report.
I suggest that you read fewer novels.
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you atheist?
"I do not think I have to say," ESME Nussbaum said.
Are you lesbian?
Again, ESME recalled its right to privacy and denial.
Feminist?
Let me turn to silence.
"I do not ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "Because I was against atheism, lesbians or feminism.
That is a place where there is a lack of respect for the workplace.
We serve a society that is prejudiced.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are perfectly acceptable and laudable, may occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things that you call the "forbearance" and" roh,'' could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of natural and vitality that may be interpreted of course.
If you continue to go around what was done, WHAT was done, when it was done yesterday, it would mean that if it had happened yesterday, it would mean that the country could take on its essential vitality.
ESME Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED label in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter-century or longer.
Smile your neighbors, value your partner, listen to ballads, visit Musicals, use your phone, speak your phone, speak, explain you say, listen to you, vote you, vote you out to apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand perfectly what you want to say," ESME Nussbaum responded with a calm voice when she was sure that her foreman had spoken to the end, and I say nothing other than that we are not as effective as we are deluding ourselves.
My concern is that, without prior warning, we may find ourselves in the way in which we repeat the errors that first occurred to DEM WHO was carried out that was supposed to happen.
This time, however, we are not the others in which we leave our rage and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed with the hands of a pyramid.
To indicate a patient who is patient.
"They go too far," he said, when you call acts as "bugs" which our grandparents may have said or not committed.
They also go too far when you say that they had left out their "rage" and their" distrust'' to "others." 
It should really not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past, as in the protection of the present, do not speak of "us" and" others.''
There was no `we 'and there was no` other'.
It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.
"When we are honest with ourselves," When we are ourselves, "When we accuse ESME," no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I do not blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good to do what happened has happened.
That was then.
There is nothing more to say about that - we agree on that.
And just as no guilt needs to be attributed, it is not necessary to blame if such eradication was appropriate and if there was a way to wipe it.
But what is the purpose of the past if we do not learn from it?
The past is that we forget them.
If I may say something about that, let me say something.
Luther Rabinowitz was able to fall together his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said.
On the next day when they went to work as used to work, she was driven over by a motorcycle driver who, as described by passers-by, was driven by a kind of "brutal rage" in a kind of" brutal rage''.
There are cases where there are cases.
Lesotho-military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Officials of the military in Lesotho went out to have planned a coup to overthrow the government, and said that they went against policemen who are accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and informed him that the country's army occupied his home residence and government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to the adjacent South Africa after he had reported of his attacks.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is de facto of no coup that the military responds to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police have put in place.
"What happened this morning was that of the Defence Forces of Lesotho after he had received several intelligence reports that, within the police, some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political fanatics who were about to wreak havoc," he said to Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman, Clayson Monyela, said that military action was the impression of a crash.
"Even though no one has claimed to have captured the government through violence, all the reports agree that the activities of the Defence Forces of Lesotho have shown signs of a coup," he said.
Speakers of the military of Lesotho reported on Sunday that the soldiers withdrew into their barracks and remained calm in the capital.
In the meantime, the deputy Mothetjoya Metsing takes over governance during Thabane absence.
Thabane has said that he believes that he has been targeted because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been great tension since June after Thabane parliamentary meetings prevailed because of the confrontations in its unity government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, despite the accusations that were different.
Production in the Eurozone
The increase in output in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point of the last 13 months, so a closely observed study had done.
In August, the market purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7, according to a booth of 51.8 in July.
An indication of more than 50 is given by an expansion.
New orders went back and experienced breakdowns in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan to deal with a sluggish recovery of the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information this week to consider whether it will consider quantitative easing for the eurozone in line with those that have been made by Britain and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although a little growth is better than no growth, the growth of economic and geopolitical uncertainty has become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner, fell to its lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second-largest economic nation of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46,9.
France remains a kind child, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications are that growth incentives in the key industrial machinery of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer effective," Mr Dobson also said.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the analysts who expect more monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing that can be said about the purchasing manager of manufacturing in the eurozone in August is that the sector will continue to grow." 
He added: "Producers in the eurozone are currently very difficult to find, as current increases in geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - are increasing uncertainty in the increasingly difficult circumstances in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and probably leads to delaying or even cancelling some of the orders, particularly large contracts.
He said that it is "always more likely" that the ECB will have to initiate a kind of QE," Although we suspect that will be limited.''
The hurricane of the survivors of Beslan has taken place: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school as the children involved are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 Chechen militias were held hostage in a school in Beslan.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at Greueltat in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the appalling siege of the Beslan school, in which 334 people, including 186 children, died, warned the heroic survivors last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, that seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into disgust, and surprisingly transformed into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years on, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at Greueltat in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will follow it for ever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that Ukraine is now looking for and in which children die is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb back into the shattered school sports hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri and became famous when she only tried in her underwear to climb back into the shattered school sports hall after a mine was exploding.
Aida was completely confused after her mother Larissa, which is now 40 years old.
Both were dead, but they survived.
"A woman said to me that I should race for my life, but I could not," said Aida then.
My legs were overwhelmed with blood.
I stood up and climbed back to look for my mother.
A soldier brought it into security.
After a series of operations, she stopped healed completely, but yesterday said: "three months ago the pain returned.
I am afraid that I have to continue operating.
Some pomegranates are still in my knees.
Your aim is to become a dentist in order to help the people who have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but did not break me," she says.
"That is what happened to me, and that can not be changed
Once a year, I will always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to speak about it in other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamt to go together to school.
"I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
To a family I think later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory of each year becomes somewhat weak.
I am glad that many people around the world remember our horror, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, as I go back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and help to avoid happening again.
The boy who fled through the ball of the ball, in the belief that his mother was dead
It was his first school-day (Russians go to school with 7 years of age and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara).
When I was seven years old, he said: "Mama told me that I should lay down when there was an explosion and keep its hand." 
After an explosion, he thought she was dying.
She said unto him: `Run '.
Full of fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw him on his way to be a crying kid it took it at hand and fled through a ball gel.
His father, Vladimir, who joined his son outside, said: "Damir said to me that his mother died.
He said: `I could not save them '.
In reality, Tamara was stunned by Tamara, and with legs in hospital, he was forced to assume that her son had died.
After reunification, she said: "I was crying for joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown over to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) in order to get the title of a Barnardo Children's Champion from the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering" he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is floated in my memory.
I still know that I threw all my toy guns straight away.
But now I can play computer games with firescenes and that is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back into the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, with whom I played in the court, and with whom I have not managed to do outside.
We never say that they have been killed or are dead.
We say that they have remained in the sports hall.
I remember very well on my trip to London, particularly to the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted and the ride in a above open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me of it.
"I am so sorry about all those who are suffering from the abominations," Damir said last week as a volunteer worked in a monastery.
I want to help.
I want to go to the police one day and I hope she will take me next year at the Training Academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 Children from our neighborhood were killed you can imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could cry and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers vividly her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London wept when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world understood our feelings and showed their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say to her simply that ten years have passed, but I still remember the meeting she and her husband remember in London, and as the Damir and me helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschsch and called on all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British shared our pain and supported us.
She said: `I always think that this world has not become better in these ten years.
In Ukraine, the war now goes on, and every day, people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are precisely those children such as ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or related.
I simply know what these people feel the whole horror.
And I can not stop without feeling it
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir was large and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is neither aggressive nor angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past greules.
I know that he does n't like to remember that, but he has six close friends of the class and they go to the sports hall and ignite the candles there.
When he was smaller, he was suffering from - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa, the face of us, for hours.
Do not sleep, his eyes were open.
I remember how he continued his weapons and other military toys.
I hardly believe that I was so safe for a couple of hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came up to the legs, I looked around me, and I saw hell around me, with body parts that lie everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy in that hell could not have survived.
"I remember that I called him," Damir, race, go away," but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he has gone away.
And that is how life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17
The Young, whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the horror of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan-occupied Georgiy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, on the right of a picture of Georgij
His bloodstream was afraid of fear when he ran around his life when Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, had removed him for his first school-day before she rushed to bring her older son Wladimir to university.
"I left the farm approximately two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy who stayed there for three horrible days stayed alone," " She remembers.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgiy managed to survive.
The closer this date approaches, the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day in which we do not remember that tragedy.
We do not think that it was long ago, I mean it was going to happen yesterday, and some scenes from these days follow me forever.
No one will forget that, I promise you.
Insistent: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgiy was so keen to go to school this day; he said he wanted to change his teacher.
I only knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the wine-producing Georgian in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden among us at home in the bookcase.
I understand that, but I also mean that the people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we have ever experienced the truth.
People investigate such tragedies over and over again and are never aware of the truth.
And now they investigate the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Are we ever going to know what it was?
This is a world that is going to be a bit horrific.
"I can not understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants war
Ten years is nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to remember it a little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four or four years I had a couple of nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid of every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That is why I am always going to go into the sports hall when the 1st September approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old child friends.
It is difficult for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I do not feel the sacrifice, that story is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not paint me.
My life continues.
I finished the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I will be heartbreaking.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted a soldier, but my health did not allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgiy Faniyev, 20
The Young who survived, although he was captured at the feet of a murderous terrorists
One miracle: Georgiy Faniyev was captured during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached at the foot of a murderous terrorists.
It is indeed a wonder that he was not killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgiy, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but was unable to do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me that it is nothing that I have left behind me.
I am older now and people say that children can easily cope with evil experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little bit better, but I ca n't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - in the year - was the first and the only time I went to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return to it again and do not ask me to tell you where I have sat in this famous image.
Living: Georgiy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do n't like to think about it or speak about it and they never asked me about the school.
I think it is a good thing for me to do so.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can now walk well.
But because of my health I could not study at the FSB's secret service in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I have submitted my documents, including the medical ones, and they have replied that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have had two years behind me there.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows." 
He said: `I knew that I would never report from my experience to my children.
Children should not be aware of that and they should not, of course, suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain will never leave me.
It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary draws closer.
I am going to go to memory.
I know that Georgiy will not go.
It must be a lot more intense for him because he was there and I did not.
I waited at home on him and could not help.
I am grateful to God that he was returned to me.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.
It is difficult to accept that when something is so unfair.
He is a boy, he likes sport, but he can not participate because of his knee.
It has been operated on several occasions, it can run, but it can do no sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror at 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only strengthens my pain.
I lost a lot of people who I knew well and which were expensive.
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift that God could make me make, but my heart is crying for the batons.
I know of families where new children were born, but also widows who never married.
It is difficult to accept that life continues, even if you do not want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is close to our country now, and I almost do not believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If we could only attack and throw out all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was so taken by a special command squad in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is brought to security by a Russian Special Command Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelties at all.
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was born in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists left them, but in their barbarity held back their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister, Kristina, and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years of age, escaped, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, was married and with his new wife Swetlana a little girl that he called Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, which is ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown up to an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that have taken place with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Accused of killing girls on foot of pedestrians in Fife
A 78-year-old man is in front of court because of the passing of a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian walkway.
Gordon Steward is accused of holding a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment admits that Mr. Steward has steered his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention, and the girl injured.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, disputed the accusation in front of the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC used the January procedure for January.
4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a water-proof point And-Shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or Action-Cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver edition, both of which are worth around $300.
I added these photos to a family firm with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment there are some rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other subjects are closed.
Put your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some of the cameras and camcorders have scenes and recordings with which to optimise the exposure time to minimize underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, you will see to which depth your equipment is operational.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.
Search through our purchasing guide and the reviews of digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many will not fold down.
Point and-Shoot-cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, Action-Cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD LCD, it is difficult to see this under water and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So you will take a lot of pictures.
If your camera has a string mode that makes a series of shots with easily changed exposure settings, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is dramatically worse as you continue to remove from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This will allow you to get more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Take a closer look at the objects.
That is also a good advice to the countryside, but it is even more important in terms of poor light conditions.
It is particularly important if you work with an Action-Cam: These devices often have a wide angle of wide angle, which means that you need to approach your objects if they have to fill out the entire image wire.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changes things, even in a gigantic organization like the NHS.
As an advisory he devoted his career to the task of saving the patients both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, as his wife remembers, was a MI6-member who had to live with the disastrous effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and diseases, while the treated are mostly employed with something quite different: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose suffering began.
"I did not feel me," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulties of teasing me.
While he fought with the fierce symptoms, he noted that he had impatiently reproached his wife, Juliet.
"I want to do it all as soon as possible," he listed.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt completely and without reason.
Anything was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray examination were available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, that is to attack the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers are diagnosed with lung cancer, not all lungs have been smokers earlier.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is a burden of asbestos - contact with the fibre material that was once known as a "miracle material" was recognized as lethal.
For most of us, mesotheliom is a disease that can be ignored easily.
Finally, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960" s when the industry voluntarily committed itself to failing to use it.
Even when it was used, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the substance - plumbers, construction workers, carpenter and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous material from a different era, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is what is happening today.
There are more deaths from Mesotheliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.
Annual figures of Mesotheliomo cases since 1980 and prospective future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects when asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999, all types of asbestos have been banned) is that a mestizeliom was developed only after decades.
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not confined to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and shop the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protected area.
The parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogens.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber, either.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks as if in the tunnels around Guy's Hospital, where I have completed my education for six years, there was a lot of asbestos." 
All - students, nurses, doctors and Pförtner - take advantage of the tunnel.
One wonders how many of my elderly people will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer that question at least partially.
"Of the four doctors who were educated at Guy's Hospital, which were infected with mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in 2010 in a letter," I am the last one to live.''
How many are we going to develop?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with Mesotheliom at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55th.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty per cent of all Mesothian sufferers die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always lethal.
That is why we can only repeat what many of us will be ill." 
Britain's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic is expected to end in the UK, a total of 90.000 of the disease will have fallen.
Most of them have no idea that they will die.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the people concerned are frequently turning to compensation claims, shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioms is already prevalent.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer gave, for example, that Janice Allen mistakenly suspended asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two sites - one of the flagship stores at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she started her career at M & S
Now she has two children in the kennel.
"Before this thing," she says," I have never heard of mesotheliom, I did n't really know anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought that I was involved.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not relate to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "Asbent Form," a description of the fibre structure that makes the material resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly used asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof boards, for floor tiles, for pipe insulations, for boiler insulation, and even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is nonetheless viewed as a "big health risk" between the EU and the WTO, with possible death.
However, the danger is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was one of the main reasons for the uniquely high rates of trade fair trade." 
A staff at Marks & Spencer was held at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, exposed to asbestos.
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mestizee victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of the people concerned which shows that `a significant proportion of Mesotheliomas without known suspension was caused by work or in the House by asbestos in the environment '.
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It seems that nobody can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster palace, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service powers and tube lines behind the committee's premises were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres have been thrown away by something that is so harmless as "strong air movements." 
Members of Parliament are frequently accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Executive Board of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Western Minster Palace have received a "clean medical certificate" , it is now undeniable that 1 billion £1 billion have to be spent over several years in order to renovate the parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and after the general election 2015 the Members will meet more in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre than in the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that `the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant rules'.
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
All that can be done is to wait.
A person who has never been able to determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to the asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, but I can not prove it in my case
It is so difficult to remember all the places where people worked and the data.
What he remembers carefully is the day of the beginning of December 2009, in which he was given such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he carried out an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came quite suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought it was impossible to make the journey back home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the breast skin, the skin, was caused by his lungs.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mestizeliom.
He did not go to work a month.
Doctors took their breast and set up Pleurakathether to take fluids from the lungs and test them in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without a diagnosis.
His health was slow, and he returned to his job.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned back, often after sporting activity and severe breathing.
In 2011 a patient arrived Abbotts with similar symptoms in his practice and was diagnosed later with mesotheliom.
But Abbott also now did not join with his own case.
After all, his patient was older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The link in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated and his family doctor brought his CT-Sscans and X-ray to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a probe fitted with a camera was introduced into the cave between the ribs and the breast skin.
I am an optimist.
I mostly make more," he says.
To be honest, I had not had so many concerns.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "It was said to me that it was Mesotheliom." 
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesotheliom
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan-nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now will he consider the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, particularly in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now being affected.
And then Mesotheliom meets younger people who did not work in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes were located in hospitals in hospitals, so patients were unlikely to be exposed to the material.
But many of the staff who took stairs from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely to come into contact with the poisonous substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have saved hospitals for patients, but are life-threatening to the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students placed their petals on a plate of asbestos mats.
And it is not just hospitals that are concerned.
Asbestos has frequently been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its fabulous isolation and flame retardant properties.
They also have schools.
In fact, many people have had the first contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemical clinics, students have placed their petals on the mats.
The subject of asbestos in schools is often referred to on websites.
And meanwhile so many innocent items are included in our homes like floor tiles or scales of scales of the standard of asbestos.
"It is an industrial organization that is included in much of our real estate," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that was taken by a woman concerned was the demolition of a horticultural crop in the 1970s.
So take a look at how to tear away your garden scales.
The effects of diagnosis and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not focus on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew that I had to go and care for myself.
Well, I am not going to experience another Christmas party.
The biggest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to a patient.
Like countless patients, he remembers him how he was overwhelmed by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record it all," he says.
"I asked my doctor" How long do I have?" 
And I was given me approximately 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Oh yes, I am not going to experience another Christmas.
That was `s. '
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious because our maintenance of life - the breathing itself - is that it causes deadly cancer.
Most of the cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of small fibres.
If the asbestos is broken up and the fibres are inhaled, they can be placed in the breast skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asthma fibres irritate the breast skin and may cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled nadelcal asbestos fibres," Professor Tom Treasure, a heart and thorax doctor who switched to the guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital from which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed him to the asbestos, is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated a number of others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
When the needles of the lungs reach the lungs, Treasure says they are pushed down by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature, from the very beginning, it is invasiv.
The usual options in other cancers do not work in Mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotter.
Some say that it is worth trying.
Treasure denies that.
"It is not possible to cut the breast skin," he says.
They do not come around with the knife.
In the meantime, the cancer of chemotherapy does not speak very well, "show the effect," but not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But in the end they die all.
Fortunately, some patients are actually living long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After he contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott arrived in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consultant for the people concerned four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, the core of cancer," he was happy to present himself with calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis for four years and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which last four months and is expected to continue for one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson managed to make things appear in a more positive light." 
After the consultation of several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart and thorax specialist in the guy.
"We had an advantage of being unable to continue, I called simply and got an appointment," "
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and had to wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial to Mesotheliom sufferers in order to be able to take advantage of the best available therapies.
But when these treatments invariably fail, many face another financial concern - the future of the families they leave.
And thus they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very small burden was a health risk.
And here companies" negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital in their case added their case, but it was not what Morgan called "full compensation," because Lawson was unable to prove with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to an asthma contact in the guy.
After the investigation into his death, a spokesman of the guy confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990" s.''
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is mesotheliom sufferers who seek compensation, an enormous problem, the lethal contact of a company or a job - decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plainers.
In response to this, there was clear new legislation this year, which makes it easier for mestizooms to claim compensation even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a fund funded by the insurance industry to all, which was diagnosed after July 2012, was able to provide proof of contact, but was unable to sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiff will receive 80 percent of what a court might have had in a normal compensation process - approximately 120,000.
About 300 successful applications in the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many of the mestizos, thinks that 350 million £was a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"That is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, implying that this is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time had not gone away and the patients who have been diagnosed could find the companies and could normally sue them.
Mike Penning, the Minister of the Labour, also admitted that the law was "not perfect." 
But both Peaks like Morgan, said that rapid action was required every day in the face of seven death victims.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Law in December of last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After its initial discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triplex therapy that allows long-term survival rates over five years of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"That is of course with the most important thing," Abbott says.
This is always seen in patients.
There is something that lets you continue.
If you go up, you get worse off.
Graham Abbott withdrew from the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Replica scans did not show any signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my breast.
I was going to be 50.
That is not life-threatening.
That is vital.
Again, Abbott continued to undergo six chemotherapy cycles.
There is now no trace of tumors more visible.
But the process is both physical and psychological.
You have to think of practical things - about the money if I am no longer, or my wife will show how the time setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
They have to look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.
"For parents that is hard," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and unstressed.
They told them their friends and we got very many calls soon.
Ellie was more restrained.
She did not say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients need to undergo.
But these talks are not crossed by hope, not from a trail of hope to survival.
As Stephen Jay Gould may have done, the disease brings a fierce security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government elections, protesters swear retaliation.
On Sunday, in spite of the increase in calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament ruled against the nomination of candidates for the elections of Hong Kong in 2017.
This is probably the long-heralded protest in Hong Kong's business district, while activists cut the planning and mobilization within a few hours following the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese National Congress allows the Communist leaders to expel all of them.
"That does not happen unexpectedly, but it makes us angry," says legal expert Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing had promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong have been lying.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the Hong Kong administration were to be "chaotic." 
Since 1997, when Britain has returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow its residents to elect the government headquarters from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because the Hong Kong citizens have a direct vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership retains the process in the hands of a Nominating Committee controlled closely by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the land and love of Hong Kong" are to be allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicised protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement whose organizers have threatened to detain the financial district if Beijing does not allow any real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within a few hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the government district in Hong Kong.
In the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned them in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make any further indications, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers reported that the movement had considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all the opportunities of dialogue have been exhausted and have no alternative.
We are sorry to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days and on Sunday there were stricter security measures in front of the government, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is exacerbated by the sense of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
To train people from the mainland reinforces the competition for products and services.
The fear that Hong Kong's values will begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing is also growing.
Some criticized the Occupy-Central-movement demonstrations as they threaten business operations - the life of Hong Kong.
"The protests from which they speak could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they are going to continue," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We do not want to fuel fears that Hong Kong will be out of control.
That impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled Chinese media recently reported on the pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong as a subversive agent controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the right of voting, in which 78,000 people participated - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of people attended one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school leavers in the USA is now transferred to universities where freshmen performances are offered with the private aircraft.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering Britain's first luxury travel service to students of today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service saved a security business.
This service is an ideal alternative to students who otherwise need to train their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxuries.
A corporate spokesman said that no new bookings were made because the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next weeks." 
The company also said that despite the tuition fees of 9,000 a year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today differ in their expectations and expectations very much from students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF it is possible to do just that.
But the National Student Union criticized the service as opposed.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for higher education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who begin their studies this month face a crisis of the cost of living because the financial support available in the form of credits and scholarships do not keep pace with sharply rising bills for the simplest lives of life before they can think at all to spend thousands of pounds of pounds as simple as the arrival at the student residence.
Feminists criticize racial issue and police behavior according to Ferguson
The unarmed teenage teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson.
The participants put their hands in the air and sang, "hands tall, not shoot," while they were waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks' protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators place gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, while tensions in the Middle East increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned to 100% of the race.
In comparison with the responses of black women shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays with titles such as "thinking about Ferguson of a white woman" and" feminism does not just revolve around the oppression of women'' was relatively late.
But for Perez that was an important change.
"I do not think that there are many people in feminism who speak about the white, and privileges speak in such a high class way that she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are facing and because the situation in Ferguson is so orthodox that they must express it.
Ferguson brought up problems to which black American women are exposed every day, but was not considered as "women's" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partners and get 150 leagues from everywhere," said Mitchell.
When I say something about how ferns stand under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to speak openly about a relationship, but not about public security?" asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who have studied racial, gender and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women did not have the luxury to separate the themes; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women are now combining race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at the George Mason University, says that its predecessors did the opposite.
"In 1865 and 1890 at least 10 000 black men were yellow and the explanatory statement was almost always the rape of a white woman," " said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynchkilling.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point when white women voters such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the fight for the right to vote could only have been successful for each group: Women or blacks.
"They took the decision to stand up for the right of women, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," " said Hattery.
Remembering such things makes you aware of why coloured women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to be organized against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was born almost 40 years after the original request for support of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - a mirror of time in which white feminists played "Fangen" with the problems with which black women have been living up for generations.
"It would not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to the education of a child as serious as they do with the right to contraception," Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation who built their career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means are now trying to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steiner went to Facebook two weeks after shooting up Michael Brown and published a succinct article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian columnist in which she calls for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger that is inherent to the body, and opinions on race, which are significantly different in public surveys, will be called" Steiner." 
Although Stone stands for a rather inter-sectarian feminism where racial and gender issues are addressed, some of their comments on the issue of race in America are astounded.
Christina Sommer, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole feminism?" said to She The People said that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are far more vulnerable than their sisters, but are in contrast to their earlier critique.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but they are almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently introduced a small program, My Brother's Keeper, in order to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that is pressing in the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police addressed almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is again coming to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, Co-President of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that if you look at the issue as an important issue of women, they merely have to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
If the vast majority of the labour visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate in the women's organisations," she said.
"pig house" in Ipswich is for sale.
The image of a house we have in sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it was a large pig that had made itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120 000.
Among the details there was a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig that had his head on a sofa.
Property broker Connells said that the pig on the photo is the pet of the owner.
"The photo was mistakenly published and was removed now" said a speaker of the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former collection as a "unique detached house with a bedroom." 
Although the broker has removed the image from the web site, it still appears on advertising material.
The home sale caused interest in the social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SWCity Harvey is home to a new millionaire based on lottowin.
A lottery from Harvey is this month?
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth is continuing.
For the second time in five years, a newspaper kiosk in Harvey drew the jackpot in the draw of the first division, after 1 million dollars in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner must still report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said the profit is responsible for talking material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city talks of nothing else, and all are quite excited.
We thought that such a gain could happen.
Eight WA-winners celebrated profits last month in the first division, a fair conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a married couple from Belmont had only reached the mega-win of $7.5 million a few weeks ago.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them to travel a world trip and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the world this year, with a total of almost 85 million dollars.
Leonidas in the Gladiatorenarena
It was n't only the gladiators who had a sledge in Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who stood up to the rain and the early cold and were enthusiastic about the historic spectacle.
There was a colourful series of depictions, performances, games, exhibits, and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martidish fighter group of the gladiatorial school "Amor Mortis," which used every period of time to demonstrate their robust combat art in the area where soft sand was prepared.
Gladiatorial owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presentator and sent his men in the ring to the heroic battle of various gladiatorial circles in succession.
First of all, the "Provocators" were on the row with a rectangle and a short string as well as leg rails on the left leg and arm on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest, short string and litter, as well as iron gladiator helmet, bass and arm guard.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiro arius," which joined the" Secutor'' with the net of dice, 3-zack and Dolch against the "Secutor" and recently joined the fight to the ground.
As it was possible to cross the swords in metal, the shields and the litter flocked through the arena that fear and bange could be caused by the health of the gladiators.
But on that, the imposing "Summa Rudis," the muskulous arbitrator, had an always attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and to experience the culture of the Roman period," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the Association of Friends of Roman Canal, the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park for one day was an "Oppidum Roman," a Roman city that had been mentioned in his greeting in his words.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of these were also visible at the Roman day, for example "aqueduct marble" of the 11 metre high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridge that once stood at the ventilation elberg.
The frontinus-society once and now opposed the water and energy supply, and Petra Fricke, Petra Fricke, knew: "We are still taking advantage from the knowledge of that time." 
Ralph Heiliger, a graduate engineer from engineering team two from Rheinbach, presented the measurement instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as tiles from the original hypothet, the hot air conditioning, which once heated the Roman villa.
It was also impressive to see the footprints that had been left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the Rhineland Regional Association had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Rhine in Rheinbach.
One was found to have found the walls of an economic building with a Darre for drying cereals and mixing.
The building was likely to belong to a Villa Rustica, a farm property, the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass of glass, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The Villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until in the case of the Germanic people in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser is suspected.
When they occupied themselves, they also used the Roman windmill game, similar to the one they used today, how the Roman students used to write their names with metal on wax boards.
At the stand of the Roman thermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to put mosaics themselves, at the booth of the glass museum Rheinbach glass mosaic and use a heavy wheel-mill from stone to grind the flour for a supper or a muesli.
Thanks to the ancient Roman voyage that was built by two cold blossoms, visitors passed through the theme park and came over at the impressive booth of the Municipal Gymnasium that presented the results of their "Römer-project twop." 
With a Roman Week from 13th to 21st September, the town of Wachtberg will also take part in the post-2000 Roman year, which will remind us of the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and historical union and the Wachtberger Wander-Association, the Association Club and the Oberbachspielkreis Oberbachem are offered among other things thematic hikes, a lecture, cookery evening and guided tours for school classes and the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legion from his work will tell us of his work on the nearby Wachtberg, where plants are presented as living thinkers of the Romans and offer a funny lesson in the field of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germanen" and associated Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme in the context of a project week.
With the Roman Week the numerous remains of the Romans in Wachtberg are expected to be experienced again at first glance.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus a small presentation to the Fund of the Bercumer Matronenheiligalism will remember 1879 in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is burdened by Western Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies distance from distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to the economy of West Africa.
The crop rotates on the fields, mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has placed the region hard.
Some international companies also distance themselves from distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis, but also an economic," says the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It is a total disaster and we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second-largest market in Liberia's Capital Monrovia.
On the market, only who wants to buy food or anything for disinfection wants to buy against Ebola.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, and here, alone, the fever fell more than 600 people to the victim.
Health officials recently declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
More than 1500 people have died and thousands of others have died.
Foreign Companies
Companies use their businesses everywhere in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies, such as Arcelor Mittal, are leaving their employees, and several international airlines no longer fly the affected regions.
Local traders and peasants are also reacting: Few merchants leave their home in order to get a boost.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia that are in quarantine, among others the cocoa and coffee beans that are important to exports are scrapped in the fields.
The peasants do not dare to leave their homes for harvest.
Getting rid of food
"People are going to travel more and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, is dear at home.
The people will therefore feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: Food is scarce.
In the markets, stocks of staple foods such as rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international firms, is threatening an image store - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international firms avoid the area for a long time, as Philippe Hugon says of the French think tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will spread.
When it comes to investors, the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus invest as well," Hugon warns.
The disease also affects the strained national budgets of the Member States.
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets are heavily affected by high spending on the health system and additional burdens on the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (45 million euros).
The impact is also felt in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
It is true that the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected.
But, elsewhere, many people remain in fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels also go back to the hotel.
Protecting Your 50th Anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
The preparations for the 50th anniversary of the foundation will take place at the Schützenverein Tannenwald from 12 to 14 September.
Scheduled on Friday, September 12th, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker." 
On Saturday is 18: 00 the big Bon shoot will be shot.
Then, in the big tent of the mood evening, is "Stoapfälzer Spitbuam." 
The brass band makes music for the music.
Highlights on Sunday are the feast service and 9.30 p.m. in the parish church and the mass procession at 14.00.
In the afternoon is also the distribution of the price of the Federal and Gauck.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 dame with their Dirndln.
The band is the band of the brass band Berngau.
The patronage was taken over by mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary General Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907 when the association was founded on March 21.
The Nazi regime had initiated the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964 there were 19 young men who were born on the 30th of April at the inn of Lukas.
Charles March and Adolf Ried led the association as a protectors through a difficult initial time, in which it was mainly a matter of finding a club locally and installing the shooting range.
Already in the fall of 1965, the Schützenverein in the inn "Leininger" started with two teams in the lap races.
In the following years, the sports that have been organized in seven teams established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauleague.
The club purged every year and the magic border of 380 rings was reached by Rudi Meier for the first time.
Just as the efficiency of the active shooter has increased, the number of members has developed positively.
After the "Leininger" association was no longer sufficient to meet the demands of a modern protectorate, the then Executive Board, under the leadership of Johann Rinn, decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new" Landgasthof Härteis.''
After a work of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988 the parish of Strasser for the new protectors gave the church blessing.
One of the major highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gauge, linked to the solemn consecration of the new protectorate in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary of founding.
A Böll group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became a member of the Böll Group.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the direction of the Bavarian Böll Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association modernized the rooms and firing system last year and brought up to date the latest technology.
Eleven Teams in Round Futures
It is also possible to see the sporting performances of the Schützenverein.
In total, 11 teams are currently participating in the races: Six air cast teams, an air gun crew, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann will be added to the District League 1 in the round of 2013/14 from the Gauoberleague (highest league in the Schützengau ANB).
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has been upgraded to the Gauoberleague by the Gauleague North.
In addition to the shooting range, events such as bucking, carnival and royal ball, club flight and Christmas ceremony are a tradition.
With this the protectors are also at festivals in parish and parish.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when returning to the circuit.
Tony Stewarts' return to the circuit ended approximately half ways through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time when his right front mature burst in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car to the garage and left it without speaking with journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that his 14-year-old team was disappointed, but they are now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We drive to Richmond and hope that we can make it better.
Stewart continued his race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch in a wall and had to repair the right-hand side of his car.
"I received a good deal of hope to a good result today," " I said,'' "It just did not work." 
Long after the second crash, Stewarts' car was loaded and the team was packed and was ready to depart.
Stewart won three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another rider at an Aschenbahn race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his work, while investigating the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., and was assigned to Stewart during a race.
On Friday, the authorities reported that the investigation into the cause of the accident was going to last at least two weeks.
No decision was taken on whether Stewart should be charged with a charge.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start to the 12th position, Stewart had soon entered the first 10 and was temporarily in four.
After a restart in round 122, fell bushs
Car with No. 18 beyond control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, whereby both cars drove against the wall.
Stewart continued further, but he fell to 21.
Searching for Friends of Dancing
Simple: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Director Lisa Neitzel (from the left).
Like many other associations, jazz groups in the TV Jahn make it possible to create all-day tuition in secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have been decimated.
Now young people are being encouraged for a sport that is healthy and is great fun.
In the two jazz and modern-class bands of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and Modern dance band Spirits, are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to 12 years, six in the group of 12-year-olds," the 20-year-old says.
With more athletes, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance very different choreographies," she says.
If you are interested in dancing, Thursdays between 17 and 18 hours or Fridays can take place between 5 pm and 6 p.m. or on Fridays from 17 to 18.30 in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation to take part in the training session.
"The training regularly begins with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
After that, various choreographies will be held.
Jazz dance has no fixed shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements ranging from folklore to classical music to sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the conviviality is not too short.
"We are also going to eat dancing and we have already stayed in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot to do your own motor development.
If you do n't like jazz dancing, you will be able to jump in one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and young people can take a look at the classes regularly in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, bamboo dance, bamboo dancing and Hip-Hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you are interested in disco fox, long semen, Viennese waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, let's go by and take part in it.
Bulgarian Prisoners of Government
Hundreds of prison officers from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Court of Justice in Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands to restore their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries also stand on a list of receivables that is to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have protested symbolically for one month against the new working hours and are calling for a return to the former 24-hour layers.
In spite of the meetings between the union of the prison officers and representatives of the Court of Justice, no agreement was reached, reported the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR).
The negotiations are continuing to inform the Director-General for the implementation of penalties, roses Zhelyazkov, the BNR.
The protest of the prison officers is expected to be supported by members of the union Association of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian Army has given up to Luhansk Airport.
In eastern Ukraine, prorussian fighters are still on the march.
After severe battles in which Russian tanks were allegedly involved, the Ukrainian army has given up today, Monday, the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had already drawn the political consequences of the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced change in the supreme army leadership without giving details.
Prorussic separatists shot off from aircraft.
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussian separatists have once again fired a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in the area of Donetsk, and according to the insurgents, the insurgents reported on Monday Russian agencies.
Reducing vessels of the Coast Guard
The insurgents also claimed that, for the first time in the Sea of Azov, two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard had sunk.
The Ukrainian border protection confirmed that two of his vessels on Sunday were under fire in the vicinity of the port of Mariupol.
When seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev said the station was 112.p.m
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several villages have been brought under their control in the area of Donetsk.
The Diplomacy in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the Ukrainian Contact Group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a representative of the separatists should also take part in the eastern Ukraine.
In the run-up, all of the actors used their appearances to publicise their demands.
NATO Would Not Breaks with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia because of the Ukrainian crisis as a result of the Ukrainian crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels, and NATO is the founding agreement of the 1997 NATO-Russia Council.
The NATO boss, however, accused Russia `of a flagrant breach 'of the agreement.
"Today, we need to face up to reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
Documents and statements from the Russian side suggest that they consider us to be against us." 
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen also announced that they want to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" that was adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that" we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary,'' Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow, with some of you coming to new gas talks
According to official indications, Russia and Ukraine have agreed to enter into new talks on the settlement of their gas strikes.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, as the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still waiting for the European Union to decide whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
For weeks, Ukraine has received no fuel from Russia because of the dispute over the gas price.
Finally, EU energy commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned, and Russia could also interrupt gas supply to Europe.
Europe accounts for about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, of which a large part of it flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks a word of power: Toll is going to be "very clear" .
Now the Chancellor is once again committed to doing this.
It is not, however, a licence for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU party against the road tolls have made the CSU look tough.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word for the introduction of car tolls after persistent opposition from its CDU.
"To make it quite clear that it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU in Berlin.
But on a detailed model, Merkel did not stand up for the time.
In the black and red government program are called "certain parameters." 
The Federal Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) put forward a proposal, and the work is being continued." 
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on voting `no 'to a toll on all roads.
Merkel also emphasized that Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also had a constructive contribution to the deliberations on a bill.
Beyond the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other ways to enable more private capital to invest in infrastructure, for example in the area of broadband.
"There was nothing special about that." Schäuble had left a" Spiegel'' report on Sunday to leave his house with his own concept to repay motorway investors with tolls, after the election of 2017.
Horst Seehofer, the head of CSR, then warned that the cabinet had to develop tolls against the lead minister.
CDU's Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement has never been based on trying to garner all kinds of cycles and federal roads," says the Federal Ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia, which was established in North Rhine-Westphalia.
In that respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that it will discuss the subject again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesfederations of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland Palatinate.
In the background, there are fears that tolls will affect small border traffic to neighbouring states.
Seehofer had demanded because of the toll criticism made by CDU coalition coalition.
The Left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-toll is dead," said Party Chairman Bernd Riexinger of the" Neue Börse Zeitung'' (Monday).
"With the toll, the minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads that should be launched in 2016.
However, according to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners may not be charged.
That is why they are to receive a full compensation for tolls through the motor vehicle tax.
However, the model must not penalise foreign drivers under EU legislation because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often wrongly diagnosed
A Britin says she thought she was dying for many years as a result of misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had to live only a few years after she was diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth-Disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnoses are a frequent problem among people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which may lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, uncertainty and curvature.
Illness is also affected by deafness and pain, and the disease is incurable and progressive, meaning that the symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (IAs) - a disease that had very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she was going to sit in a wheelchair before she was 18, and die her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who is 51 years old said: `As a child I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I fell constantly and everything took me longer.
I could never go with the other children rollshoe or skateboard and was often taken in school because of my way to walk and run.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to discharge her and stretching her feet, she saw her sickness when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from IAs.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I did not tell it to anyone, but I went home, looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA-society," said them.
When I was given a reply, I was shocked and I was panicked.
I thought I was going to be 18 in a wheelchair and I would die with 25, and slowly lose all my abilities.
I did it all with me and I planned my own funeral.
She said when she was going to be 17, she was aware that her abilities had not taken so much as she had imagined and how to ask her doctor.
He was simple, and hugged me and said, "my love, I do not think that you have that, otherwise you might already be in a wheelchair now." 
I think you have something a bit less life-threatening.
After a number of genetic tests, the CMT was detected.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt as if I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT-Aconsumess month in order to make it aware of this disease.
D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireman since the closure of the former army of force.
For almost ten years now, there has been no increase in the number of people who have been set up in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, every month of lethal ammunition appears at the heart of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve.
The shells are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the spot.
A deafening bang resonates with the explosions above the heart of the Biosphere Reserve.
In December 2004 the last sharp shot fell on Münsingen, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time the 6500 hectares is the core of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open on 13 marked trails for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burdens on businessmen in the area of Washington is rising with economic recovery
Economic recovery means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax offices in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published survey last week, and the companies in the area of Washington were no exceptions.
Companies in the Area District, Maryland, and Virginia jointly paid out $27.6 billion in state and local posts in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent against the revenue of $26.6 billion in 2012.
Last year's government and local tax burden rose by 4.3% to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9% per year, and the third year was falling after the several years of declining decisions in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, so the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of District tax revenues, 56 percent, come from corporate taxes, while 36 per cent of its revenues come from companies.
Virginia has 28% of the lowest tax revenues from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is based on a recovery in the real estate values of the companies, researchers say what led to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1%.
While much of these gains come from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to be taking place even in the area of Washington.
Companies in District, Maryland, and Virginia have paid out more than $10 billion in public and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of a year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in property values in Maryland is not so effective in raising public and local tax revenues, as property taxes amount to just over one fifth of companies" tax exemptions.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the real estate, particularly in the tax area of D.C., is either in the possession of the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is thus forced to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not be attributed to the recovery of the property market
Corporate income also seems to be recovering, so that the data may be.
Companies in the region reported income taxes among state institutions from $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland accounted for $1 billion in corporate income taxes, which is the region's highest.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase equally in all three places.
The rate of entry in the district was 4.3 percent higher than the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an underaverage tax of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has 6 percent in all three departments that have significantly lower income taxes (in all three there are corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and a relatively high 9.975 percent in the district.
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower and local corporate taxes are required and a better fiscal climate prevails than in Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same sentence is like Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5% next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income objectives next year, that law could reduce the state's income tax rate by 2017 to 3%.
In the meantime, it seems that small businesses in the area of Washington seem better, and they therefore pay more government and local taxes, as is the recent study.
Corporate taxes that are paid as personal income tax by small businessmen - a transitional structure after which the majority of small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland, and Virginia, last year rose by 20% to 2.4 billion dollars last year, a much faster growth rate than corporate taxes as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes in the whole country will probably last this year, with an increase in the general majority tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the area of Washington could lag behind when the federal government's spending cuts affect the labor market in the region.
Twin Town: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - including in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's twin town now wishes a brewery and hopes to have a flight direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's Frankfurt twin city Guangzhou - is the urgent request of officials in China.
"We would be delighted if a German brewery were to settle down in our town," said the vice secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Time and again, the official Communist Party of China returned in the course of the discussion to this issue of the twelve-million metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also known as the canton of Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
That is why people also had the purchasing power to afford to buy German beer.
The Hessian SPD-Chairman Thorsten SchäegerGümbel, who led the German political delegation, said to the host that he was going to listen to Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"For beer it does n't take a lot of things: Good water, cereals and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party top in Guangzhou.
Mr. Li, who radiates this kind of joie de vivre, flattened the host.
After that, Guangzhou, which was based in Guangzhou, came to grips with Schäfer Gümbel, which was served with red wine that was served to the dinner.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business transactions
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, which said Vice Party Chairman Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but in 2012 it was removed for economic reasons.
"It would be worth the money," local politicians demonstrated.
"Business relations between our two cities continue to decline." 
At present, travellers would have to take the detour through Changsha in the province of Hunan.
The administration of Guangdong province, which is the capital of Guangzhou, hopes to travel through the airline.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, expressed that wish when talking to the Social Democrats.
"That is a very good idea," said Schäfer Gümbel - Chinese vice president, Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, who said no.
Well-maintained partnership
Guangzhou's idle vice leader hopes that next year he will be able to visit Frankfurt as a partner event.
Li Yiwei was already in the main, but not in this function yet.
He only came to office this year after his predecessor was promoted out of office.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action taken against the Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration that Xi Jinping is pushing through.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked in front of his party career for an American company, which is extremely unusual within the Communist Party of China.
Before he took office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top manager in Fujian where the VW built a large work.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen town-twinning events.
The connection to the 9000 km away from Guangzhou is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as that of the whole of Hesse.
Next year, it intended to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, Li reported.
The family of Joan Rivers "expresses the thumbs
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was delivered to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter was hopeful that the 81-year-old woman was recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa said today in a message.
We press all the thumbs.
According to her mother, she was delivered to the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in the Mount Sinai hospital.
The doctors consider it to be deliberate and, under close observation, until they are more satisfied with their state that continues to be described as "serious." 
The reactions came from many pages, also in the form of an overwhelming online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners who are coming to trade today, stricter environmental standards will apply in the future.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from September 1 get a label where the buyer can see key data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, more stringent nitrogen oxide values apply in the category of "Euro 6" .
There is also more money for the scaffolders: They get a nationwide uniform minimum wage of EUR 10.25.
Amazon Buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
Amazon just confirmed what information had been reported on Monday morning: The online retailer and video producer and a large number of other things - buy the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes surprising, not because nobody expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely assumed that YouTube was buying the company.
Three months ago it looked as if the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google was approved by Google for a cool billion, and the cooperation also seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it was quickly become a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravours in games, a "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The Twitter interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which the Better (mostly older ones) give a paint of secret science theatre, are very popular on YouTube.
It is true that YouTube is often called when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was recorded something bored, a textbook example of an established technology that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not happen, as the company was prepared to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything we know about it at the moment is what we know about Emmet shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community that they share our values and long-term vision and want to help us get faster." 
Another secret is, to be honest, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say that they prefer to exercise sports than to do with it, it is hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others when playing games rather than the control console.
It is one thing to watch a friend at 3: 3 on his shoulder while watching them through resident Evil and watching something else how he will shoot 20 times the head in Call of Duty.
All of these games could be viewed now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego-games, so they can be given their own control over the eye view of a good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete all games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as it is not a play or human virtuoso, his Twitter channel is probably not so interesting.
But what skeptics know as I do about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video, how YouTube Twitch could easily swallow.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: Thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers.
As the Chairman of Twitch, shear, said, Amazon and Twitch believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of contraction, and not once - sip - as spectator sport.
At the "Hüpfburg" near the castle, there was a lot of work on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was true.
In spite of the vigorous rain on Saturday evening, it was estimated that 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times they had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and Fun.
Out of two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name of Amula.
For the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is expected to radiate its brightness on the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from itself anyway.
This was evident already in the early morning when the first visitors to the Open Air started.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they have been able to do that.
Around the castle gardens there were Salzwedeler, but also guests from closer and closer surroundings.
They followed the first live performances, wippts with the foot in the beat, sweet drinks - in short, relax pure indulgence and enjoy enjoyment.
And that right across the generations.
While there was one of the specially planted white sand on the beach bar, others used to go to a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, and the offspring on the Hüpfburg, which was a major attraction for the smaller guests.
But also in the case of children's shirts, the volunteers had to do all of their hands in the truest sense of the word in order to get to the crowd and to conjure up imaginative creations to the small faces.
The bigger ones took advantage of the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop that taught the Goodfoot-crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he raced to the visitors, especially families looking for the space and dry.
But the appeal of the festival did not detract from its appeal.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a" success on the whole line.''
That's why there is nothing to repeat the big party next year.
Although work has to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made clear in a first assessment on Sunday in front of the popular vote.
He described as annoying that, in the meantime, the admission had to be stopped.
Apparently the security company had been booked with too little forces.
The result: Some who had already paid no longer came to the terrain.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer of about 1200 visitors spoke of about 1200 visitors who were living in the Burggarten.
There have been problems in the field of clay.
When he was killed, he was forced to leave.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned Shishade Lounges could not be built up because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tyre cup.
"In the coming year they will be there," says the organiser.
The premiere of the Amula-Open Airs was more than achieved by the visitor numbers.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers made a number of bugs that will be removed for the first time, but have to be removed in the second edition.
Even in the social network of Facebook, the organizers have to enter into criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros one was simply expected," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"You have unfortunately taken over a bit to you," says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it is very good that some people are not only stupid, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hats off!," writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
The organisers now have a year of time in which to put down these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinking
That is not what is expected.
What is more, the included component is waiting to be used in the striking construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observatory Tira is renewed the shell that is called radom completely renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller than the old one, with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
But the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new casing is the Kappentausch
The upper quarters of the old shell are separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new casing will be set up.
If the weather is involved, the action should take place at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge
Isabelle Roberts of the United Kingdom screamed so much when her icy water was cast over the head that she violated the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge went painful next to it.
A woman was brought in to hospital after she had so much interest in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she gave up the jaws.
Isabelle Roberts of the UK created so much when her icy waters were cast over the head that injured her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was the case, my jaw remained simple," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is covered over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that did not happen, the jaw was lost, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw that also and made to laugh almost in the pants, but I had to get into the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was brought in to leave the jaw after the participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of pages on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the Burgundy clubs pull together soon?
Finally, there was always a dispute between the two Wolfratshauser Burgundy.
It is now time to think about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Fortress, the late Richard Dimbath, former Chairman of Wolfratshauser Burgundy, carried out the project in the French Guédelon.
Only a year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Wolfratshausen castle.
The positions appeared to be very different, how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving together: We need to discuss a common approach soon.
This is confirmed by the members of the group of Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgundy) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit together once," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of the associations could pull together in the future.
That is how we can see results that are more rapid.
While the castle of Burgundy was concerned about the late Richard Dimbath, especially the reconstruction of the castle in Bergwald, the castle of Sjöberg is at the forefront of the terrain.
Herbert Piffl, Chairman of the Burgundy friends, was very pleased with the call.
He has been a friend of Burgundy since the death of Dimon.
A new Chairman is expected to be found in the middle of September.
According to the 74-year-old member, the association currently counts about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend, Richard Dimbath, we have had to allow the club activities to rest out of respect." This" thinking period'' was needed to "consider how to continue." 
According to Piffl the new leader should go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the people of Burgundy could also find a current mood of moods within their group.
A candidate for the presidency is not currently present, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to stand because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new Chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to continue working on the project.
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honours Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Through a high level of population participation and volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also sceptical about the beginning.
But in the course of time I have come to the conclusion that it makes sense to move the project forward." It could be a "one-stop shop'' for the city of Flensburg.
Otherwise we have nothing to do with that.
Moreover, the project could be financed through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, would believe Piffl.
"I hope that the castle of Burgundy might have something to do in this area.
Their aim of documenting history first, "is important and good." 
After that, one could look further.
A clever way to save on Uni-Lieved Books
As the cost of Unix books for many students was more than $1,000 a year, the fast second student student, Matt Schroeder, put a clever saving idea.
He invented a loan scheme for books of students of higher semester and offered nominal compensation in order to delay the resale.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for one semester and a chick-fil-A-kek," said Schroeder, 19 who visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester had cost him $430, he said.
He was $120.
The Collegelsaid that students spend more than 1,200 dollars a year on textbooks and study material, but that students would have different options for cost.
Online stores and creative approaches like the junk mail are increasingly the solution of the choice for students.
The rental of textbooks is becoming more popular and thus students can use a book for one semester, often at a much lower cost than when buying.
Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 university bookstores, has said that the rental of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about one quarter of books have been hired in the College-bookstores in the last spring season, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores in Campus bookstores.
Here is the unique one for the best deals.
Online Buy
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they have to have in the campus bookshop.
The ninth edition of "calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler will cost almost $290, but it can be purchased at the specialized bookseller Chegg.com for 239.99.
Needed
If one of the notes of other or normal usage tracks makes no difference, used books are a good option.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduation student at the Brigham Young University, says that he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decision: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, Director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors whether earlier spending was allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older spending may often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is a popular alternative to used books.
Rentals
The rental of textbooks is worth a consideration if you treat them reasonably well, think they will be returned and do not want to keep the books after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly bought book.
For example, a student could rent "calculus" for the duration of a semester for about 20.
Inform yourself about the regulations of the business you rent, including through the penalties which may be added to the writing of notes, underscores or usage tracks.
Remember: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books as well as traditional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of months from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg it is possible to rent "bonus" for 6 months for around $61.
Bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best offers, since many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look around in any case.
Joe Gault, 29 who will soon be attending the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the pricing of books, as it is possible to be sure to find the correct textbook.
And before ordering online, you should look at whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks and paid the full price in the College-bookshop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" was not going to be a cashier.
"The Expendables 3" of Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million in the US, while" Sin City: A Dame to Kill For only $12 million of his budget of $70 million.
The movie "Sex Tape" which is tailored to Cameron Diaz, played only 14.6 million dollars in the opening weekend, and in children's films like" draps that make 2'' also in the revenue.
An article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that in children's films, the lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves.
Collin called "the worst year" in 2014 as" the worst year'' for children's films and called "Dragon troops easily made 2" as a purely" functional'' fantasy sequel.
However, in the case of films for a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for every summer movie that was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equal to those of last year.
Some commentators suggest that development is attributable to changing visual habits and to the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disneys's upcoming jungle movie film, said to the website Hollywood Reporter: "I think times change." 
We have to accept that and not attempt to carry out the past.
Unlike Hollywood productions that are currently weak, Netflix recently gained revenues of streaming content worth $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they focused on the filming of comics and prophesied a "core melting" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy may well contain a true core.
Due to the potential expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the fall in the cash flow results as simple "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporters:" The next summer will be the biggest summer in the cinema at all, and no one will worry about the business.''
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis area class was removed, that was a step in the right direction.
Now the German table tennis has taken over an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The consequence is that those who have not opened up have gone down.
Thus, although the highest team of gods in the Oberliga-Relegation has avoided the descent, the coming season will only be five thousand.
The fourth season of the league is Torpedos Ladies, in spite of her grandiose experience in the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start out in the Dutch league, as do the boys of the SC Weend.
SG Lenglers and the goalors will enter the new Association League, and there are no longer any kind of diaries who are represented in the National League.
The women play the TTV Geismar in the Federation League, which is the Torpedo-Second in the National League.
What the composition looks like a better area class, is now the new district panel.
Here there are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district league play as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the area class of TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are available here.
In the district league, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllfried run up.
With nine teams
The SC Weende sends their girls to the small district league.
Also the district league of the SCW boys, where Torpedo II still starts, is not complete.
In an area class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded RegionsAssociation, the two of them will start off with nine teams.
In the west season are the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Among others, Sattenhausen/Wöllgraben, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the East-season.
The Damen-Kreisleague is made up of Sattenhausen / Wöllgraben, II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the city of Osterode where there are no longer women's teams.
What is striking is that none of the six second district classes reach the desired strength, and here the innovative and powerfull district will have to think again.
NATO's Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff.
On the weekend, there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered into an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, approximately 150 people in Cardiff came together in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for the weekend and has talked to demonstrators who went to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains
Two young people who are young have been brought into control of the rope after they were caught up in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke in Govetts Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday.
Worried relatives called the police at about 20 p.m. when the two did not return to their home.
A search from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found at about 23: 00 in the vicinity of the Bridal Veil Waterfalls.
The girl was wounded in his knees and the man was toppled and had beaten up his head.
Rescue personnel stayed overnight and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in a stable state with a ambulance into the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
The about 1000 demonstrators have been pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
After half an hour the transmitter was taken up again after half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the Heads of Government who accuse them of electoral fraud.
The police told us that around a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on Monday there were clashes of about 3000 demonstrators with security forces.
After hospitalization, a policeman was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured and demonstrators tried to invade Sharifs residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, following a meeting in the army headquarters, the mighty military called for a political settlement of the conflict "without wasting time and violence." 
It continued to do so in the communication: "The army remains committed to its role to ensure the security of the state." 
Escalating violence has fuelled concerns about military intervention, which has become more frequent in the past.
The protests led by the Imran Khan and the Preacher Tahirul Qaddafi have continued since Independence Day of 14 August.
Sharif rejects any withdrawal.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters on Sunday to harden.
"We are not going to go back without having forced Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan accused Sharif that the parliamentary election was won in May last year through fraud.
Qadri is calling for the resignation of Central and the provincial governments.
A transitional government will then have to reform the electoral system and launch new elections.
Over 40 000 security forces are in use in order to protect the government district.
First of all, the demonstrators had fled peacefully in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them at the weekend to invade Sharifs's residence.
Hütteldorfer according to second season of the season at number three of the table.
With the 2: 0 on Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday was put in a conciliatory end.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate head in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The achievement of success was extremely important," confirmed the captain and the goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who had three with green white on the square.
With the second season of the season, Schrammel-dreamtor brings the right reaction to the disappointment of Helsinki and has an experience of success.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his magnificent Executive Volley from the Sixties in the 14th minute.
"I thought I was the whole of the frustration of Thursday and I sucked him under the bar," said the 26-year-old smile.
When Schrammel met in a Bundesligapartie on November 13, 2010, that was still available for Ried.
He will therefore be kept in a special memory of the first championship in the Rapid-Dress.
"For me this is something very special, I am from Rapid-children," said Schrammel.
Due to the short term of Mario Pavelic, which was taken by Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and made his case very good.
He has enough experience to be able to exercise this position as well.
The gate is worthy of him, he has already done some of the assists this year," he praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also supplied the flanks to 2: 0 through Hofmann after a good one hour that finally brought the decision.
After all, the guests could have written about it.
"God thank God we had some luck today," Schrammel also noted that the results did not vote." The results did not vote, but the playful was always good in comparison to the last year.''
Barisic even said that in many games one was better than today was," against "the strongest team that played in this season in this stadium.''
The first three points since 26 July have thus proved that the team structure has remained intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character." 
For him, it is just as positive that we have finally played back to zero
Much of the work we have done during the country break is also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger are several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl, and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start to their start and make the victory even more valuable.
"It must not be forgotten," warned Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players who have been very stable recently.''
The session pause should therefore be used to tap wounds and raise a bit in the physical field." Barisic explained that the five U21-out choice was in his ranks.
One who seems to be particularly attached to the break, is Captain Hofmann.
He joins the team, goes over pain.
He has just shown that he is a very important player for us," he noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his confusion occurred in the 68th minute not just the structure, but he also achieved the second goal.
For the 33-year old who completed his 350, the first match was in the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 on the Admira).
Hofmann: "Do not believe that now everything is good" " We have certainly had some luck, but at some point the luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
He warned, however, that he was concentrating on concentration: "It is not always possible to see this always black and white.
We have not been as bad in recent weeks as this has been said.
We must not believe, however, that everything is good now.
He was unable to deny the importance of his role to the team.
It is a very young team who I can help at the moment.
It seems to me that in certain stages it is a question of mine," Hofmann said.
Bigdig-Coach Michael Baur had had little to blame his team.
He also regretted the rapid opponent of the "Magic Gate" as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40 minute, which was wrongly detected by arbitrators.
The only charge that I can make to the team is that we were not sufficiently concrete towards Tor in certain stages.
We have had too few accounts.
Defending Maximilian Karner was similar: "It has been a bad start, but then we have found a lot and have even made a gate.
In general, more would have been said.
There is a Ruh at this summit
We showed a mighty tribe in our riddle of the summer series "My piece of Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still present in the county, and the depicted specimen is the "scourger" above Unterweibrunn.
A wooden walkway on foot leads up to the 600 years old oak.
It goes back to Koppeln, basalt clusters and basalt stones.
A little bit below the quarry of Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, it stands.
The natural monument, Vital, towers over the other trees of the area and reminds you of an amount of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only references to the registered name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bishops' Archive and asked older people from Unterweibrunn in order to learn what was the memory of the scourges.
The outcome of his inquiries was the rather sober explanation of the name.
Until some 80 years ago, the people who were goat should have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn out of the meadows that had been mooted and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the farms that have been exhausted are supposed to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its meaning, because on the meadows, indeed, goat herds are back.
The area has also been declared to be the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, and Schneider has further identified it.
You should be careful when entering the stone collections, because the basalt heated up by the sun is also a popular place to cross.
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but it is a bit hidden.
Further trails are signposted, lead towards Hochrhön and invite you to an extensive hike.
Where is the Wasserburg castle?
However, a waterway that is sought in our next task is rare to find at the height.
The mirror in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the district to which the building could fit.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner Glück" ?

After weeks of deaf, Italy's Premier and President-in-Office of the EU, Matteo Renzi, have won the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as the chief of the EU foreign policy, and she will become the successor of British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government-related daily newspaper La Repubblica reflects his appointment as a favorite in the government team as a favorite Mogherini to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost to his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes that he will calm down the leftist party base because Mogherini will be associated with it.
Compared with the conservative representatives of the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the Council of the Council, Donald Tusk, who was nominated as President of the Council, is going to produce a political balance in order to obtain a political balance.
After all, the EU's chief diplomat will be the guardian of the President of the Commission.
The outstanding approval of the European Parliament is certain to be certain.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41year politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) almost an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is a source of optimism that the tried and tested Mogherini, which has been renowned for almost two decades in leading party offices, will be able to meet the "enormous challenges" for their ambition.
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began the Docologist's PhD in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (LinksDemocrats), which in 2008 was merged with the Catholic Center Party Margherita to today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community organization of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) in 1999.
With the election of 2001 in the Confederal Group of the Left, she rose to the high party politics, worked in the foreign policy she became soon.
They occupied traditional foreign policy priorities such as the Middle East, and studies on NATO involvement in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved in a troop contingent, announced the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini his Secretary of State.
If the PD today has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed over 40% of the party to the EU elections in May, as noted in PD-circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of Federica Mogherini.
The conciliations in Brussels, which have a lack of diplomatic experience in Brussels, which lack substance, are being worked out in the PD.
In Brussels, in particular, of Poland and the Baltic States, they are being traced back to the crisis in Ukraine, and have been held up as a "sojourn course." 
It is in favour of the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company, Gazprom, which will transport Russian natural gas directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine directly to southern Europe, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
When Renzi took up his term as President of the EU in July, Mogherini went to Moscow for her first visit to Moscow.
Photos that he showed with Putin in the shake-hand were brought together in Brussels and were also invited to join the Kremlin boss in October for a summit in Milan.
A total of nine young people started their apprenticeship at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes a trainee who has already completed another training course in the company.
In four occupations the new employees will be active in the future: Electronic engineers (three trainees), mechatronics (two), machine tool mechanic (two) and procedural mechanical engineers (two).
All trainees come from the county of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Buchl of Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier aus Oberviechtach, Daniel carefree and Sebastian Zahner from Pfremd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees visited primary and secondary schools and real schools before.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all ages as well as the instructors will take part in a team training event in Oberammergau, where there is a full day hike and rafting on the program.
The company counts around 435 employees and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees is spread out over the years.
The Socialists in France should "hold the mouth and put France in order," Francois Hollande's main ally said.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the disputed socialist president, as the narrow majority of the people of France came together when the cabinet was bridged.
The President is worthy of respect, he deserves our loyalty, and he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government was not going to question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite heavy demands for an easing of the regulation of pages of Macron, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urgently called on his co-socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, sought sand into the gearbox in which she appeared in a meeting of socialist legislators, and criticized the Socialist Party for accepting the French "the faith in their futures." 
Marine Le Pen, which is the far-right leader of the National Front, failed to seek the permanent defeat of the Socialists, and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government was going to last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, they have been forced to form a new government if the old did not survive a summer.
"and the new will not survive autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen in front of supporters.
She repeated the reputation of her party after the dissolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that he will be confident that he will be victorious in early elections and that she is willing to take part in the government.
The French ruling party was defeated in the municipal elections in March, and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76% of the French people thought that the Socialist Party was in danger of crumbling into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and its unemployment figures.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel quick that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise just in front of a Prestige Cruises deal of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, NCHL.O, the third largest in the world, will lead the industry through advanced negotiations for the acquisition of Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruises of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy clientele, while competing with major rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced earlier this week, the sources said on Sunday and they warned that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked that they should remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to comments while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
The Miami based company Norwegian Cruise runs 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, a 13% increase compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates among the brands of Oceania and Regent, which together host eight crusaders on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported income for 2013 of $1.2 billion and an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is approximately $29 billion and in the next few years it is expected to strengthen the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied for the stock exchange in January 2014 in the US regulatory authorities.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a 850 million $deal in 2007.
In its current form in 2000, Norwegian Cruise was created through a merger with a crusher in possession of Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay of Malaysia.
Apollo invested $1 billion in 2008 in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise went to the Stock Exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June according to the approval authorities, Apollo 20 percent shares the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP is 8% of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together with the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises Stock Exchange have more than 82 percent of the passenger capacity on American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A pekingfidelity group waved the Chinese flag close to the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law that would allow only two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017 in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a Nomination Committee, which is expected to be filled with pective members.
Through this decision, it will be almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote, and pro-democracy activists have made their threat felt and will paralyse Hong Kong Hong Kong with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and Chinese party leaders fear that calls for democracy to expand to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper in which Chinese rule was set out in June, pro-democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region where hundreds of thousands of people marched in the city's business district and organised a sit-in there.
Lis questioning is organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong Chinese liaison office.
The deputy chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice-Director of the Office for the Affairs of Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted in the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they will meet in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain had no democratic elements until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin requires Kiev to take up "sovereign talks" with octopus.
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday, on Sunday, the Ukrainian Government stopped the fighting against the separatists in the East of the country and immediately entered into negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of the federal state of eastern Europe controlled by the separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status towards Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to Kiev's government on equal terms with the pro-Russian insurgents will fit in with the strategy that he has been pursuing since the beginning of the riots five months ago: Helping the separatists when taking areas, and putting pressure on the Ukrainian Government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region to be an alliance with Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with the government-owned television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapitalize the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk that were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula to Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the "Novorossija" or" Neurussland,'' a term that reminds us of the pre-revolutionary shining times of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who attack civilian communities in the territories held by separatists during the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians are caught up in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start with detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society, and the state of the state of the south-east level in order to safeguard the interests of the people who live there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood needs be seen in the context with greater autonomy, which have been discussed since months from the Kiev led to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern areas the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
It is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, as Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine." 
Clarifying the Kremlin speaker to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks emphasized Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct development of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians and surveys before the conflict resulted in a large majority in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy that was raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would give Ukraine's regional governments the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, allowing the Kremlin to control an area that connects the Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula annexed to the Black Sea five months ago is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on his inauguration on 7 June, the President of Ukraine proposed that Ukrainian legislation should consider, after new elections, additions to the Constitution in which the relevant areas have greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his vision of autonomy seems to be strongly opposed to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels that are accused of arming and incitement to Moscow.
Putin's latest call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on a level playing field followed a further advance of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded the Baltic Sea along the Sea of the Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia adopted in the hands that, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Nowoasovsk.
That is why massive civilian and military preparations have started to support Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasovsk and narrow access to the Crimea peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels, and urgently asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just in front of a point where there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not adopt specific actions, and the leadership called for the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainians crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers joined the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, said last Saturday in Kiev.
The first one who was trapped in Ilowajsk was probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were taken away on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured on the Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko informed on Sunday.
Nude photography scandal around Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his annoyance about hacker, which probably stolen his entourage of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and is a Who who is Who who from Hollywood has stolen from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement when a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence has appeared in a hacking scare around celebrities on the Internet.
The responsible hacker probably has over 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star of the Tribute of panem and superstars, including the models of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers of Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were allegedly also publicised because of an iKU cloak.
On the list are 101 celebrities.
The finest that had died last month with Grecko said to Confidential: "It is disgusting." 
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and can be passed on to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, said a news website said that Hack was "shameful" and that the people concerned felt" injured.''
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with their former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures in which they are located at the top of a pool.
The film works of Palmers are "invincible without being invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch was not available yesterday for comments on the chopped pictures.
As a representative of Lawrence said to TMZ, "It is an odious violation of privacy." 
Actor Seth Rogen denounced the hacker in his tweet: "hacked pictures of a mobile phone is nothing other than the sale of Hehlerware." 
From a purely legal point of view, the propagation of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cycling, jogging and trekkers were supported yesterday at the 8th cycle of the Great Feldberg mountain range, supporting the "Help for Children of Crebs." 
The tour that was a tortur was an easy workout for the other.
However, everyone agreed on one thing: It was fun to do.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus was driven to Feldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He/she is able to leave the small muscle cater easily, especially as he added a valuable insight to the participation in the 8th cycle on the Grand Feldberg in favour of the "Help of Crebtable Children" (Frankfurt).
That is a good thing.
"I know now that I can do that!" 
Small shoots on the way through the applause curve?
Snow if I had stopped if I had stopped
As Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Oberurseler City Council, tormented many of the 718 participants yesterday in the spring of the mountains, and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the eleven kilometres long circuit between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
If you want to get a lot of money, you do n't have to worry about it if you do n't have enough time to get started.
He has also taken the route through a slip, as well as Nina Kuhn, pressesprecherin of the city of Oberursel who had started off with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge:" Here it is about Charity, we are happy to do so - we would have made an exit we have already done today.''
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) went down to Oberursel in the morning to climb up to the height.
In the morning at 9am, Frankfurt took shape in the saddle, "made" the Feldberg two times, and then roll with a lot of fun to roll with fun.
It was also fun to have "Fritten-Toni." 
For the boss of the Oberurseler cult kiosks, have a look at Feldberg.
He had hit 40 minutes with his 6.5-kiln wheel.
That is a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to do so," Andreas Balzke said.
The trained Mainzer says that he is a "ambitious race bike." 
He has to be that too, because he was travelling with the "fixed cycle" , that is also racing bikes, but without switching up, he was.
It was not only the 20 hikers who went up to the summit, but also a youngster who came up with weights behind him.
If you want to travel around the world, you will be able to get back to you.
The 718 participants - and as many as never before - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The trekkers will be taken first at 9.30 am.
It was followed by the first cyclists and runners at 10 am.
Five minutes later the first mountain bike took off.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association of Radeln in the Great Feldberg, gave the starting command and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that the route to Feldberg will be closed up to the safety of the participants.
