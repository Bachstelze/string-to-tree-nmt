Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The congressional Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of unions as civil rights.
``As unions die, middle class jobs die, ''said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud of the Ombudsman's law in cooperation with the civil rights of John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the basis of the organisation of unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops so antitrade forces.
The addition of the national law on labour law, in order to create an opportunity for discrimination against workers to organise a trade union in front of a civil court for justice, and in order to obtain compensation or punishment, is a sensible and necessary initiative.
However, it is certainly not a radical initiative - in any case, it is not based on American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill suggest is the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have been facing in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country, Americans once encouraged countries around the world to acknowledge, expand and meet labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when that country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after WWII, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that workers and their trade unions have a role to play in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that ``the rights of workers are guaranteed to unification and common negotiation and action. ''
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize, and their voice in the new nation should rise, the Germans added a clause that explicitly said: ``The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the labour and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or business.
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to reduce it are null and void, which are not legally binding.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which was chaired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors proposed that ``everyone has the right to trade unions to protect their interests or to join them. ''
For generations, Americans have been able to accept the foundations that human rights are human rights.
When this country taught other countries how to shape civilian and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to create a union must be protected from being protected by collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies.
After these rights in America have been put under fire, it is clear that it is very wise to see the American ideal, which is why working people must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
How did Martin Luther King Jr. say fifty years ago?
History is a great teacher.
Everyone is aware that the workers movement has not limited the power of the nation, but has increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry, raising the entire nation at unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves it.
History is reminiscent, and that is what we should do.
The formal recognition of workers' rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that America has made in the past and the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporarily the law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana may be forced to close
On Sunday, a federal judge stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana by saying that it would probably have led to the closure of all of the government's five abortion clinics.
This measure, which was imposed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June to the law, would be to come into force on the 1st of September, when doctors who carry out abortions would force them to buy a hospital at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles.
However, the decision of the judge means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions while requesting such a right.
``The plaintiffs are able to continue working according to the law while they seek to gain these rights, ''wrote Federal judge John deengraving in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing for the judge is scheduled to reach a more permanent choice for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures, and the fact that doctors are willing to seize time to obtain hospital access rights.
``The decision today means that women in Louisiana are escaping a misguided law that wants to take their health and their rights to them,`` said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.
It was not clear whether the ruling also met with doctors from the two clinics who did not share the complaint and had also asked for permission.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, while courts have recently declared such actions in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the hospitals remaining in the state, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
The American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, have agreed that doctors are demanding unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion believe that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some also welcome the effects of a closure of clinics.
Only a physician who performs abortion in Louisiana has the right to reproductive rights.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced not to carry out abortions, this doctor would not be able to carry out the operation anymore, and the group would say that it would no longer be able to carry out the operation.
When arguing against the ruling, representatives of state capital said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, while their applications for patients in need would be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best ways of treatment lead to higher death rates in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have placed a video record for their mother online, which in 2007 died of egg cell cancer.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of egg stock than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 expatriates, and they discovered that only 25% of the year were alive after diagnosis.
The research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDIE: New drugs could slow down lung and egg cell cancer.
Researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman influenced the chances of survival in the diagnosis, the type of eggs and social and economic status.
For older women and those whose cancer had already advanced at diagnostic times, survival rates were the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions, mortality was higher than for those in urban areas during the study.
Although the study did not investigate why women outside the city died of higher probability of egg cell cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors.
``This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities, ''`` They said.
Despite improving telemedicic services to counter the distances, they proposed to strengthen the service of frozen doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women to the place of residence, as well as to treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study was independent of geographical status and stressed the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years, learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of egg cell cancer.
Garden Centres are sorry, and they are sorry to hear falling homes
The decline in excess of the number of homeowners under the age of 35 may result in a loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year when today's young consumers are reported according to a study of HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, the ``core age group for garden products. ''
The report says that tenants spend 55% of the amount that people spend with home for their garden.
The rise of people who live in highly urbanized areas without gardens, popular procedures, parks to park, and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, estimated at £5 billion in sales.
In the area of London where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43% over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people are not able to draw plants.
Guy Barter, Head Chef for RHS said: ``Container heaters are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with a move. ''
The HTA report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the ``golden age ''of the garden retail trade as a result of increasing homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the middle of the 1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politicians Imran Khan and the ghost of Tahirul, continues to be led by Pakistan.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators have teamed up the state television channel PTV.
Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protestors back from PTV building.
The station launched its operation for about 40 minutes, but it is now broadcast again.
At the same time, about 3000 demonstrators tried to reach Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence.
About one kilometre away, they were equipped with sticks and stones equipped to meet forces with security forces.
The police put Tearengas in place.
The demonstrators asked Sharifs to resign, but it rejected it.
Meanwhile, the country's army is calling for a political solution to the conflict, without wasting time and without applying force. ''
After a meeting in headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: ``The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state. ''
The military play an important role in Pakistan and have already been deployed more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan prefers to have cheated in May last year when parliamentary elections were held in May last year.
The protests were escalating at the weekend after Khan and Qaddafi had called on their followers to invade Sharifs residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appointed US diplomat for a report on espionage.
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed the country's oldest US diplomat to receive a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that US officials and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept pointed out that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major activity for the US and the British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played the important role of the report and said that all major countries invented each other.
A previous report, which was also targeted at the most important secret service in Germany in Ankara, also caused much angry reactions from the Turkish Government.
Warning strike: Train leaders threaten to have consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike at the Monday evening could also affect the movement of persons in NRW.
The exhibition stand announced for 18 to 21 the clock was attended by all transport companies, including the transport, regional, and S-Bahn -LRB- city rail -RRB- traffic.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

Said the county chairman of the trade union of the Trade Union of German Railways -LRB- GDL -RRB-, Sven Schmid, in Düsseldorf.
We are counting on significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that everything should be done to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so that it would be difficult to predict the consequences.
Police of Magaluf
On Friday, the prosecutor presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of Calvià on Friday.
The police of Calvià on the island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and barowners in the infamous Binge-drinkable hotspot Magaluf.
After corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs are at Magaluf, the main Commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, was taken in custody.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutor presented the office of the prosecutor for the fight against corruption on Friday by evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of Calvià.
Two other local police were arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the allegations of corruption, and they are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily newspaper, ABC, reported that angry night watchholders have said that the authorities ''cronies have serious consequences for their business.
``It is not much money to earn, it is about survival, ''`` One of the business people said the court.
Let us leave our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer, as a result of a viral YouTube-videos, Magaluf has made international headlines that have been shown by an 18year-old British tourist who has performed to 24 men during a tour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the illegal behaviour of non-alcoholic tourists in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants to the infamous non-alcoholic pub.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellati case took place, was forced to close up for one year to close in, while Playhouse and the tavern Carnage have to pay together a penalty of €55,000 -LRB- $73.000 -RRB-.
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is popular especially for young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents under alcohol, including the trend of ``Balconing, ''jumping from a balcony to another or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions is affected by flights from Adelaide airport.
The spring has brought a winter surprise to southern Italy, with strong spectacles and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide airport.
At the end of the morning there were a lot of time to get around the city, after 6,6mm, which had already been dropped in the night on Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of very short storeys, including a crowd that began just before 20, and for almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter took place last week for an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C
The bad weather has probably resulted in a late landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft should have been landing shortly after 7.30 p.m., but it was hit by a blow - a sudden change of the wind speed or direction of a short distance - and it had to be started.
Winds at this point reached about 50 km @/@ h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to start with a second landing flight and that the aircraft had to be launched at about 20.40.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible displays.
Matthies says: Most of the time is the great time to be set up.
In view of the technical progress that threatens to turn our cosy home into high-tech switches, Bernd Matthies is trembling with an extremely familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this, my view falls to the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone, and I think: Boah, like retro that is that?
But there is a point behind it: If the cable would not be, in the shortest possible time, all listeners would fly around in the house in a very short time, and that would be even more retro.
Anyway, what does the ekeltronic have to do?
No, typos: Electronic -RRB- is the rule that is the world novelty of today today is the electric scrap of tomorrow.
And anyone who, for example, has a satellite TV in the living room only says that he rejects television in principle.
Why are these considerations?
This is because the urge of the Ifa at the Funkturm will restore our absolute incompetence in relation to electronics this week.
Laie, who was blind to a washing machine and a CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread against him: ``Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies ''promises us the press office.
Yes, we are going to go?
What are we talking about with people who apparently spread voluntarily?
In fact, for about 20 years, it is important that we should be able to connect our house.
In order to be able to buy yogurt itself, this allows us to inform us of the fires on the Maldives that it is in the room of work.
Would n't it be wonderful when we get from the office from the office to our early arrival?
Yes, but that does require air conditioning.
But a dream is certainly going to be true soon: We lift up our armour, say ``Saugen! ''- and at home the vacuum cleaner leaves nowhere.
Let us be wrong.
Everything comes to nothing less than a revolution: ``The borders between white and a brown commodity are blurred, ''raunt a branch of industry, you can connect the washing machine with a headphones, it is possible to connect the washing machine with a headphones, the steam garer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza is still needed in the oven, how long the
We also know from everyday practice: When a new electronic device is really needed urgently, the battery is empty.
This is another reason why the spiral cable will also survive the next radio exhibition.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the area near Gaza returned to schools in the area near Gaza after they spent the summer in air condition, while rocket and mortar fell to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the area recovered from fighting.
The school start brought a feeling of joy and anticipation to the communities in the south of Israel, but the signs of the fighting are fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the staff of the ``Pashosh ''kindergarten, who was hit by a rocket, took place in front of the meeting of the children's grenades.
``We have a bit of fear, but we are excited, ''said Ronit Bart, Anuit in Kibbutz Saad, and there English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it feels ``a bit funny ''to suddenly return to school.
``they were difficult times, and we did not go out of the house at all, ''they said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer its support.
Until a ceasefire the war broke last week, thousands of residents of frontier communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to go further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the missile and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are hesitating to return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were provisionally accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said ``We are going to ensure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security. ''
Israel and Hamas agreed on an open-ended ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire caused an immediate end of the fighting; but important problems remain unresolved, as is Hamas's call for a lifting of the Israel-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel is calling for Hamas to disarm and to pass the corpses of two soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them killed civilians, and at least 494 children were appointed by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that it is at least half of those killed, but it did not provide concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and murderers during fighting in Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area, and about 250,000 people sought in more than 100 UN schools to be converted into temporary shelter.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protected areas, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
``I hope the school will soon be open so that we can continue to learn, so the children in the world and the Jewish children, ''said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl is calling into question NPD-prohibition procedures.
In view of NPD's loss of votes in Saxony, Thomas Strobl, a member of the Federal Republic of Germany, has spoken in favour of an end to the current NPD-prohibition process before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - Laut CDU-worvize Thomas Strobl should put an end to the current prohibition of prohibition against the NPD in front of the German Federal Constitutional Court.
``The NPD is worse off than in the last time, ''said Strobl, who is also CDULand Director in Baden-Württemberg, the`` Leipzig Volkszeitung.''
That is a positive development in the right direction, and a development that leads me to achieve the result is that the NPD should be fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
At the vote on Sunday, the NPD failed to fail at the Five% threshold.
A first attempt at a ban on the right-wing extremist party had failed in 2003, because the constitution of the constitution also had informants at the NPD-head.
In December 2013, the German Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The federal government and the German Parliament were not united.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
At the end of the day, refugees are now being accommodated in tents.
The head office for refugees in Harburg runs out of all seams.
Now, the Internal Authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross alongside it.
The regional politicians were just informed in advance - they are little enthusiastic.
``These Hauruck actions raise concerns among the citizens and give regional politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane shelter of refugees, ''says Britta Herrmann, Chairman of the Green Group in the Assembly of Harburg.
Your party demands that the district administration of Harburg provides unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for filling up in the initial picture are the rise of relief - and the fact that the authorities can not provide enough places in follow-up institutions
Many refugees are therefore remaining longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the most severe winter growth in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, making it the RP-data of Monday.
With this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the biggest increase in the winter since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than twice as much as the rise in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not spread evenly across the country.
The Research Director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tier market.
The figures of RP Data show that in Sydney last year rose by 16.1 percent, compared to 11.7% in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by more than five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale lies Canberra, which has been hard hit by cuts in government spending, where prices rose by only 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lawless continued to say that for the coming months, early lingering would now be an increase in the real estate that would be subject to a real test.
``If you look at the continuously high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the ongoing low interest environment is probably that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months, ''he said.
In an opinion on the New Press, he is contrary to the statements made by the Managing Director, Peer Medau, and to this `as a Feldherr '.
The style of the university is not, it is in the communication.
For example, the Medau family had already been informed about the request of the university in the middle of June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July are definitely wrong. ''
At the same time, it points out that when it comes to the plans, there are no `preferences' in the case of plans.
Also the development of the narrow road needed to access the castle is less dramatic than was feared by the Meda.
Of a nine metre wide road was and is not the speech.
It is up to 5.50 meters, this is a metre wider than it is up, ''he says.
The argument of the Medau-Operator that its free and trained parking space in the future will only be used by students of the university does not want to be counted.
It is not acceptable because, as in other public parks, this can be solved intelligently.
Thinking about residents
The children's cave is situated on the ground and would be able to walk along the parking deck in front of its front door, according to the head of the university.
What he has to consider is that this is not only the slaughter of children, but also the inhabitants who are living at the arrival of the Friedrich Stenses and the 800 pupils of the nearby real school.
In other words, this is much more than the special interests of the masters of Medau.
Whether the criticism of the child's father is being criticized, with the expansion of the road, a ``of the few unspoilt spots of Coburgs would be deemed to be lost`` the reader himself can decide. ''
At the beginning of October, Peinfl, along with the State Building Office of Bamberg, wishes to inform the town councils of the development of the higher education by 2020.
Peer Medau informed the parents of the kindergarten last week about the school's plans.
Therefore, the access to the new parking deck should not be due to the campus and the Friedrich-Stenses street, but to the Medau-Berg.
In this way, the narrow road would have to be extended to a kilometre length of about one kilometre.
According to the calculations of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would be tenfold.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles every day.
The town did not want to speak about the project.
Glandorf comes from handball team back.
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
For this decision, the 31-year-old from the federal government of SG Flensburg-Handehauer took health problems as a matter of priority.
The decision is not easy to decide, it has grown over several months.
It is for me time to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team, ''the world champion of 2007 announced on its Facebook page.
It thus comes with a balance sheet of 167 Country Games and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement.
Because there are a few years to go to Torehunt, he will no longer be available to the new Federal Trainer Dagur Sigurdsson, who wants to go to Torehunt for a few years.
Glandorf conducted a long and good conversation with the Islands, who announced his Kader for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as my long-time fellow players and my successors will inspire.
But for my club, I would also like to be available in the coming years, for longer regeneration breaks that do not permit the current double load.
In 2012, the left wing had to fear his career.
Because of the problems he had in mind, he had to be treated by team doctors from the German Handballbunder -LRB- DHB -RRB- with a cortisonspritze which had later had a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other operations followed.
When Glandorf announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national leadership go to none of the body.
I have some health sites that I can not ignore
After the three attacks on infection, which took place in seconds in 2012, I have never got the grip of my blood pressure.
For this, there are some other disguised complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I was able to control my head, but I did not deceive my body, ''Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine ``Handball Time.''
For a comeback, it would only be available in absolute emergencies.
``If everyone is wearing, I am always ready to talk, ''said the double-parent father of the magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can play handball.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I would at least be able to go in some way.
In addition to the World Cup in 2007 and the profit of the Champions League 2014, he took over 2008 -LRB- HSG Nordhorn -RRB- and in 2010 -LRB- TBV Lemgo -RRB- the EHF-Pokal.
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup winner with Flensburg.
German Economy in Spring by 0.2 percent
The crises around the world have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product fell by 0.2% from April to the end of June 2014.
This shared the Statistical Office and confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment went back.
External trade has also slowed the economy.
For the first half of the year, a total GDP of 0.8 percent is set for the first half of the year, compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the ``Münsterland Mooiste ''which took place on Sunday for the first time by the town of Burgmannsstadt.
On Sunday, the Burgmannstadt of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch.
The biggest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called ``Münsterlande-Mooiste. ''
This is the biggest cycle tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants were grateful for their registration with Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was available to interested parties in different trade journals.
We come from The Helder and drive over night to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland in this way once more, we would like to know how cyclists would like to take part in the route through the towns of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration in the club's association is Sta.
Katharina went to a small ``peace ride ''through the city over the Wall, where it took place.
The route that was advertised for three different categories continued in the direction of Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Mountain in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres with 1475 metres and 145 kilometers with 1775 metres of altitude proved cyclists to be able to withstand their good condition.
They were dressed in Havixbeck and Billerbeck on the way.
The main organizer, Heinz Lölfing, was delighted to announce the success of this bike event.
We are happy and it was a great experience for all interested parties.
The organisation went without problems and there were no negative incidents, ''Heinz Lölfing began to draw a positive conclusion of this event.
Sorry, there were not so many participants how the organizer had hoped to see what was probably bad weather forecasts and morning rain.
``We see the weather coming back again in 2015 on 30 August or during another weekend, but the cyclists still promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new start.
Constantine wake up honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical record as a biography as a biography of what Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, has brought to paper in 287 pages on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thought nets have written his memoirs on 1 June 1947, and each chapter begins through a matching song text.
And he is ruthless in this: From the Onanie as a secondary school to retail theft and drug use, it is not a matter of human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide scope also take abstract, but the more important terms are: Love, soul, ego, the being in the now, spirituality, all of whom he tries to go to the bottom, to a very philosophical, but also to a very personal extent.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment, and also, as he has not only shaped the music -LRB- the opera lover became a soul and a rock musician -RRB-, but also his prison stay.
The latter have also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the asketic monk who is created by subtraction, as he says, ``by letting everything be removed. ''
There are also very short anecdotes about the earth: For example, there are over beasts in one of GIs or a crazy car ride where he planned a tree.
Here too, he is utterly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father has never taken me in the arm.
Have never said ``I love you ''
Henry was one of seven children of a family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was, worked in a factory and was limited.
Henry tested for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work by some difficult childhood moments.
He visited ``many ''therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is remembered for his relationship with his father.
It was difficult to know him.
One never looked at his face, only his voice was heard: ``Her with the collar.
Let your sister stay in peace.
Get rid of it!
I want to look at critiques.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown when I was a child - went to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the beer or the beauty of a cricket.
I have never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than it was at the time of his father, he won a glimpse of how life had been for him.
It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, it is dark, it is dark, it is rough, deep style of Labyrinthe is dark, it is dark, it is dark, it is dark, it is dark, it is dark, it is dark, it is dark, it is dark, it is dark
My father was earlier in the tub and then he was able to hear him slowly how he started to sing because he was able to wash the foundry.
When I went around, I realized that he had done that for years to put the food on the table and my respect for him was greater.
However, Henry grew up as a child without producing love for his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said ``I love you. ''
Only when my mother went badly at the end of her life, we began to say, ``I love you, I love you, I love you.
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love that he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with ``I love you ''?
Listen to me to get rid of me!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still a friend of French who married him for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys's own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to their death.
So, when I was very busy and symptoms of diabetes showed, my doctor said you must be radical.
So I moved to this workout and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henrys's career change may be seen in its elegant, short-cut bar.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he was captured by the theatre.
It was the comedy of the mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than Sitcoms and comedies who have completed their busy working life.
He began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s. ``I have been for a very long time the only Black Imitator / Comedian on television. ''
He learned in the profession.
I have to learn not only to the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient WAP narrative machine while I was through television a star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
As his manager had the stage law at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light programme of entertainment where people were called ``black anmold, ''Henry launched his comedy there for five years.
The room was clean and the bathroom was clean.
I somehow hope that it would never have happened, but I do not regret that I have done so.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a great audience.
But this ``long-awaited light pillar of British television ''was also a`` grotesque parody of black people.''
By introducing figures that celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the 80s at an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the lenny Henry Show went to the broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was among others as the head chef, Gareth Blacklock.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series, and film roles were predestined for the next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: ``what are you doing next?`` What are you doing next? Len, because it feels like it feels as if you are just driving time, or to take back a little in place. ''
After that, a documentary series for Radio 4 was released with the title What's So Great About?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
In Shakespeare, I was practically allergic.
I had never learned anything about him at school, and I mostly thought of it for a domain of the middle class, white in tights, and a coal head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
All who we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said ``You should try it.
Do not make it bad if you do not know what you are doing.
Take a couple of words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare.
Henry made 20 lines out of Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I had the feeling that I was able to do that.
It was almost as though someone had finally put the head on my head.
``This is what it is, it is a serious matter to take them seriously, the text of your text is serious, you investigate your text, searches a little more.
The samples were brutal, and I read this for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that simply did not happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the national theatre and I could not believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, ``Oh, you have changed you. ''
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
``A little voice told me`` You have to walk 10 minutes while they repair the computer. ''
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea would go as soon as the problem had been resolved.
I went from the stage and something in me said ``Oh, thank God.
I am not responsible for this.
I can leave it to anyone else.
``You play in a play, so stick to your role. ''
Henry in Fences on Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the eyes.
That too came well, so it is like a big sign of the gods who tell me to say ``This is your destiny. ''
He says this, of course, with a deaf voice.
So I will stay in this.
I really love that.
I love to be in a sample room.
Henry still has the head of a comedian - we are talking about a lot of humor, while he is always imitating people.
I have decided not to make a stand-alone comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction is somehow dangerous from a room full of stranger.
If you are looking for that forever, you drive in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in the Apollo when I want to do so, but I do n't know as much as before.
I would like to ask him if he will again be able to make a stand-alone comedy tour.
The fun I have in an area with a director who helps to create a start, a middle part and the end of a journey - I do not think I would like to give up again.
Is this the new incarnation here?
I think so.
I'm happy to be an actor.
It is fun.
You always tell a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi-Rebelles are blocking roads in Yemen's capital.
In the conflict between Shia Huthi-Rebelles and the Yemeni government, the Huthis have been calling for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi-supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman of the Huthi-party said ``Ansar Allah. ''
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports from a traffic chaos in the capital.
Huthi-leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi was asked to take action according to the online issue of the newspaper.
Huthi threatened to have a further escalation of the conflict, and his demands should not be met.
Shia Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni Yemen and are calling for the government to resign.
The Huthi tribe has been besieged for almost two weeks the Yemeni capital.
About 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps at the major access of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registered officials to contain ``ghost workers
Kenya has begun to register all state officials in order to delete ``ghost workers ''from the government's pay lists.
Staff who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a statement of government.
The government estimates that thousands of people will receive salaries after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised when he took office in 2013 to combat corruption in the public service.
When it was examined at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least EUR 1 million -LRB- 700,000 £-RRB- was lost per month to payments for ``ghost workers ''and through other abusive financial practices.
The government estimates that salaries will continue to be disbursed to accounts after a person has died, or public service is reported to Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear in the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, and they have been notified in a statement of government.
Anyone who would not be doing so without a credible apology would go further from the salary list.
``This action will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also the pay list on both levels of government - the`` ghost workers ''are eliminated, ``said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding art adviser Helge Achenbach is being negotiated on 11 November for the first time.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi-Gründers Theo Albrecht, are calling for compensation from Achenbach and two of his companies who are in insolvency proceedings.
This was one of the judges who spoke on Monday.
In the piano, Achenbach reported that when works of art and vintage cars were bought and Berthold turned out to be higher than actually paid price was charged.
As a result, the agreed commission was higher.
Achenbach purchased 121 million euros of value for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He served as head of school for 44 years.
From this time, Manfred Richter is familiar with many of Petershausener and Kollbach from the age of time.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but it was always borne by his desire to see people in the pupils.
The snow is the best known mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau @/@ North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
After four years of age, he was interested in the teacher's profession at the age of 14.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave the house.
After a number of months in one camp it went to Bavaria in 1946.
This is how it comes to judges in the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
The teaching of teachers took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week, ten kilometres to the nearest train station, with the train to Bamberg, where there are three kilometres across the town to school and the evening back.
After two months, Manfred Richter received a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross Home in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 pairs in a sleeping room.
In 1951, after three years of teaching, he made the second state exam after three years after three years of teaching.
When Oberfranken had not had a free apprenticeship for him, he fled to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The ``milling room room ''was the first`` service apartment'' in the school house.
In 1958, he referred to the school as a three-room apartment in addition to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
As of 1968 @/@ 69, they were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, Georg Sigl changed to Karlsruhe and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so, from September 1982, the children and their teachers were able to take part in today's construction, which was extended to judge retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the senior mayor, Ludwig Götz, who was able to build a workshop room and the extension of the cellar in 1997, even though that was not eligible for the guidelines for school construction.
``Mayor Götz was very indebted, ''judge pointed out.
In his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who responded to a meeting of a school council on justice and justice: ``You must never forget the love, ''Manfred Richter said what he had heard of as a young teacher.
``You have to give the children two things: Roots and wings, ''says today, 84-year-old.
And he had to know: ``This does not always succeed, ''and whether he believes that only his pupils or his own six children are believed to be, it is not clear.
In any case, judge has sometimes been unconventional.
When pupils are tested, they did not receive a penalty from him, and they were not beaten for sitting either.
At the expense of the community, judges had created two pairs of boxing gloves and were able to compete against each other, even if there were a number of things to do.
For the benefit of the school, judges took a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz -LRB- CSU -RRB-.
He moved the party after retiring in 1996, at least as a last on the CSU list for the town council.
But judge was elected to the square and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists set up in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and hire stopovers.
When Radler moves on its tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast, that is nothing special about it.
On Friday, however, the number of resting impressions made the impression: The 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour enjoyed a break at the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
Under the motto ``Radeln and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig, ''participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday, there was a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: The cyclists took the first stage, which takes 60 kilometres via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by mayor Hans-Peter Congreses, who was in Bad Vilbel with the bike, and the head office of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing Döring, was welcomed.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of things have been prepared for good things: The rural women from Rankenstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple, etching, stream cake, and cheeses that have wonderfully healed the skilled cyclists.
``This cake can only bake in rural women, ''praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while he stopped another piece.
Cold refreshments could be found at the drinks tax of the gym.
The ``Duo Bravo ''provided visitors with famous melodies from operettes and musicals and enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
One of them also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: ``He deserved, and finally he has already bolted back a battered cycle. ''
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: They were interviewed at the fountain before the tip of reporter Rainer Janke and they took advantage of the opportunity to promote the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also since the first hr4-Radtour in 2004, Tobias Hagen has also been able to buy snow since the first hr4-Radtour in 2004, even though he had plenty to do with the technology on the ground.
His picnic bag, where he was communicating with his staff and working with the 15 members of the police, he communicated with his staff, wrote facebook entries and made reports he also needed to check in.
``Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area, ''he told us,`` also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from many cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends on the accommodation capacity available.
In category I will host participants in hotels, in category II category.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up after one and a half hours: ``Chüss!! ''
``It was nice in Bad Salzhausen! ''
After the arrival in Schotten the group was able to take a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists were required to take part in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing -LRB- GTS -RRB-, the park had a beautiful festive atmosphere and, of course, it was prepared to prepare desserts, such as a flame cake with a chilled spring white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS-Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC-Chairman Wolfgang Wagner welcomed the visitors as a member of the ADAC Hessen-Thuringia as a member of the ADAC Hessen-Thuringia.
The Three have visibly been pleased to hear about the ``many operations in Scots. ''
DJ Tobias Hagen then gave the dance stage free.
The opportunity for a fun, despite the sporting activity on the bike, has been eagerly used in spite of the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests, there were increasing numbers of people who were increasingly interested in the good atmosphere as well as the great shame of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations of Birstein, Guarditersbach and Bad Orb were on the program for cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers due to ``conspiracy ''against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on account of the suspicion of ``conspiracy against the government, ''reporting local media agencies.
Police authorities did not make a direct comment.
Among those who have been arrested, 14 senior police officers are reported to be reported to be reported to have a special news.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four ministers of government last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they were allegedly founded on organised crime and called telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -LRB- who was Prime Minister at the time -RRB- described her actions as part of the activities that are led by the Islamist clerical, the reformation of him, and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools opened in Ukraine on Monday -LRB- 1 September -RRB- after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij brought his daughter to school.
There he told journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful across Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole Ukraine, a huge joint Ukrainian national front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, teacher of the school in Slawjansk, spoke to Russian in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace and that the children will receive a education that will be useful to them.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, and the children wear embroidered shirts, hold ballons in the hands and give flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets a proud glory from the banking world, media management, and the inner circle of the Tor party.
And it has its own front-end experience.
Her career began with the global management consultancy Bain and Co., which she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bomb, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned as the chief post of the parent company Pearsons to a younger male colleague.
Their discovery was supposedly £1 million.
Your political rankings are also sound.
It was recommended by Lord Browne, the former Chairman of BP, as the former Chairman of BP when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: She became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory counsel.
Even in May I described the task of the Chairman with a poisoned Kelch.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence works in two directions: From the first to the first, the first guard of its own manage hierarchy in the BBC, but also a voice of public concern and concern, when things are wrong, is public concern.
That gives rise to an almost unsustainable Duopol, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
However, what would be the new leader who would risk fighting to go on everything, and an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may be doing his job, may be as complex as it may be.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that were not enough, many of them are still interested in seeing the BBC - power, money, and status.
While the competition moves closer and new technologies threaten old and comfortable collateral, the pending negotiation of the licence fees for the BBC is linked with particular dangers.
For the modest amount of 145,50 £per year, the British public is buying in the most important media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: It says that it reaches 96% of households and costs only 40 pence per day.
And apparently the BBC is rising up at the top of popularity: 53% supports it today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news on my mobile phone today and I can see what they are doing later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very dear and remarkable institution.
It needs a remarkable chairman - I hope it has found it.
Perry from Texas says that lowering Tweet was not authorised.
A Tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a damning remark about the democratic county prosecutor, who is at the heart of a criminal prosecution against him for abuse of power.
The Tweet was deleted later and was replaced by another of the Perl user account that rejected the previous one.
A Tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
``I do not approve the Tweet and have deleted him, ''he said.
Staff of Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perrys went out official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
The former Tweet was marked by an unfavourable picture of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced in April 2013 for a change in the tax.
Perry put a veto on a financial promotion of its office when it refused to resign what might be a indictment against Perry - who could be a 2016 presidential candidate before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweets reads: ``I do not always be drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level, but when I do it, I teach Governor Perry when he tries to do it. ''
I am the most hated democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the study of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry argues not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His highly classic team of lawyers asked for in the case of the case of the case to write the indictment and argued that the law directed against the former governor in the history of the state of Texas is unclear in the face of defamation.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state money from the state integrity unit of the state - based in Travis County, and in cases of government corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog-group.
Perrys official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he completed his presidency in Iowa during his presidential candidate in 2012 during his presidential candidate, Perry went on to speculate that he would put a stop to speculation that he would stop by sending a Tweet of a photograph of himself to jogging near a lake postete with the words ``South Carolina
Berkeley explains the housing market again for ``normal ''
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market returned to normal levels in the south-east of England.
Homes in the capital were hot, and huge price increases, which caused the Bank of England as a result of widespread fear of a credit bubble, was able to set limits for mortgage lending in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors, said on Monday on Monday: ``Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013 ''and it added that this provides a`` stable action environment.''
The property market in London was well situated during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the catalogue, the prices in urban areas rose by 18,5 percent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales.
The average selling price at Berkeley private, cheap and student offers increased by approximately one-fifth last year and was at the end of April around the 42323,000.
However, in recent months, a stronger pound has made property property in London less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric by a possible ``Villtax ''before the coming May elections.
Last week, London property brokers warned that in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April would also lead to lower market growth, both in the price of property and at the prices.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the property market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another property agency, revised its forecasts for the rise in housing prices in London to 3% in 2015, on the basis of what is already a weakening hood.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington has fallen year by year by a quarter of a quarter, according to the broker WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the overdue amounts for futures are worth more than $2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: ``The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, the futures sales remained stable. ''
In June, the company reported that it sold 3.742 new homes until the end of April by the end of April - almost a third to peak before the crisis in 2007.
The annual pre-tax income rose by 40 percent every year to €280 million, sales by 18 percent to $1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley is expected to meet current market expectations this year.
Analysts estimate the annual dividend of £450 million.
Berkeley shares stood in London in the afternoon at 23.96 £.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence's performance was at the 85th anniversary.
Naked photos of the Oscaro winner Jennifer Lawrence were released online by a hacker who claimed to have a ``master list ''of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star ``The Tribute of panem ''confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were authentic and that hackers complained of`` blatant violation of privacy.''
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
In addition to this, most of the photos that were originally posted on the Foto-Sharingpage 4chan were allegedly obtained by a gap in the online storage system icloud from Apple has allegedly been obtained by a gap in the online storage system icloud by Apple.
It is not sure how many of the images are authentic, even though Wenger, a star from ``Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world ''also condemned the hack on Twitter.
``To those of you who watch the photos that my husband and I recorded years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope ye are so happy with you, ''wrote Wenger on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from Nickolodeonseries ``iCarly ''and`` Vicment'' did not deny that the photos are about images of her and tweetete ''These so-called nutframes of me are falsified people.
What we can do is to defend the beginning of the beginning.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a spokesman of popstars Ariana Grande reported the authenticity of the supposed photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons praised new novel about love and the letter ``J. ''
It was best to describe it, you could best describe it, it was slowly up to a box that you can see in the rain.
Occasionally, he told a woman that he was too serious, tiring, intense, and perhaps something of scratch.
And shake his hand.
He knew how to do so.
He was stale, as it was in Igel, yea.
The last victim of this slate was a very beginning affair that was more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life, and perhaps he would have had some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a treacherous beauty with untold hair and a flushing heart from a village on the North Island, which even disappeared, and he was humbled as a port.
She came to the south with an older to the south, held the Kevern for her aunt, and inherited a plot in a damp but heavenly valley with the corresponding name of Paradise Valley.
No one in the house had lived in the house for several years.
The tubes were leck, in the baths there were still spins, neck necks had to leave their tracks on all windows and they believed they were one of them, and the garden was monitored with weeds that looked like huge coal heads.
Like the house, there was a garden full of secrets, like a house from a children's tale.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel ``J ''stands at the Longlist for the Man Booker Award 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had to sit with Ailinn on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their aggressive aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Nothing was banned - nothing was banned correctly - just did not be played.
It has successfully become obsolete as the word becomes obsolete.
The general taste of what you would have achieved and what the rules would never have achieved has never been achieved, and like the people in books, they have decided to choose the vom-Tellers for millionty memoirs, cookery books and romance of love, so they chose the ballads with the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano.
Ailinn did not understand this.
``This was a famous song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller,`` he explained it and put two fingers on his lips automatically.
That had always done his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a Penny.
It was not a very fun game at the time, and it was not very funny either.
He knew what he was expecting, and that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard.
Jazz was not played, even if not directly banned.
The improvising was no longer modern.
It was only place for a single one in life.
People wanted to be quite sure at the beginning of a melody where they would end.
That is also the mind.
His unpredictable made people nervous.
And jazz was music-driven mind.
Although he had been ten years old without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he did not have to tell Ailinn that Fats was black.
In their age, they were unlikely to remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Once again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of a group - grateful just like that of fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and body construction, so they swore and burned them.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were as from the nature of electronic talent, and were with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working phone.
What had yet to be left by the Polish community took care of the canalization; what had been left of the Greeks.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents have not left the country quickly when the country had been doing the country have been called WAR, who had to be charged with WAR, who had to be accused of being accused of being prosecuted for fire; the flames of fire would be accused of fire
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since it had only heard ballads, Ailinn fell hard to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung could ever be made more expensive.
Music was an expression of love.
``These are not really offensive, ''said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
He was too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the enormous leaves that are enormous.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father have loved that?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but he hesitated to place two fingers in her present.
It already thought it was somewhat strange.
``It appeared to be funny, ''he said instead.
They shook their head and blocked the dragon view.
There was nothing else on the whole of the world when she had a nasty little black hair.
There was nothing that he would otherwise have seen.
``If you say,`` I do not believe them.
But that does not explain why you are telling me.
It seemed to be honest.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet do not so directly.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit
And you say you hate me because my ankle is too thick?
Are you eating out?
Of course, I do not hate you.
That is just the silly song.
He might have said ``I love you '', but that was too early.
``Your thick ankle is exactly the reason why you hit me,`` he tried to do it instead.
I am a little perverse.
That was wrong.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he was often in trouble because, like his father, he had not had the calming charisma that was needed to tame the cruelty of jokes.
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be Kevern, that.
Despite its friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was red and rose from her deckchair, the console threw the console and swallowed the wine that she had consumed.
It was not a surprise for him, so it was not a surprise for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, as Palmwedel appeared in the storm.
``and your Dickhead is exactly the reason why I feel permissive to you, ''said she
Except that I am not.
She was tired of him, both because of the unnecessary simplicity of his words and also for the fear that showed in her eyes when they rejected him.
Did he think he would beat them?
She did not tell him about the life of the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was in essence as it was here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke out here, as there was there on the banks.
The same confusing men, with more thicker skin, with more thicker skin, had to be spread by the ancestors who had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, and they moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or hated them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown a big fist if they did not fit in!
They only stumbled - the most used word was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter-gift to the empty love ballads from the console - they only stumble and then beat.
According to Kesee, this was unnecessary, because the knutch itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign from her body.
He rose from the deckchair like an old man.
They also felt stable, but the pain of his grief surprised them.
That was not the end of the world.
They were barely aware of this.
She saw him how he was removed from a room at the top of the room - a man who complained about something that he himself had imagined.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
They felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, even though some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned from her, his back bowed to be ashamed, to be ashamed, to be defeated, to be ashamed, without fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she seemed to know well when she was not able to remember a single time she had already seen something before today's day?
When she was alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
For a number of years before the events that have just been reported, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, was working on a short talk about the continued force of force at low and medium-sized levels in exactly the areas of the country where their reduction, when they were not abolished, were to be expected
``much has already been done and much has yet to be done,`` she wrote, ``she wrote,`` wrote it to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who has led thousands of wars, and gained most of it, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human friendliness has rarely been felt in times of
However, some features prove to be inevitable.
The higher the church tower, the lower the passion it continues to awaken.
The people who live at the hearing of sentimental ballads are eager to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless, not only the former crude of rural communities, as well as our urban fabric, are firm, but are also providing evidence of the emergence of a new and restless dispute at home, at the workplace, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
``You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate, ''she said she was a mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest that you read fewer novels.
ESME Nussbaum cut its head.
I also have to ask: Are you atheist?
``I do not think that must say, ''replied ESME Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Once again, ESME recalled its right to privacy and denial.
Feminist?
Silence.
``I do not ask that,`` Luther Rabinowitz finally said, ''``I would be against atheism, readers or feminism.
This is a preoccupation of free jobs.
We serve a society that is unbiased.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort the results you have presented.
You yourself seem to have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call a ``silent ''and`` roh,'' could be interpreted by others as an expression of an expression of strength and vitality.
If you continue to walk around what happened, WHN ES said that if it would have happened yesterday, it would mean that the country should take account of its essential vitality.
ESME Nussbaum looked at itself while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head repeated a LED font in Flamingorosa the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile your neighbors, take advantage of your partner, listen to ballads, listen to Musicals, listen to your phone, use your phone, speak, tell you, tell you, tell you, listen, vote to vote, vote to vote, excuse yourselves, excuse yourself.
Talking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the writing, but nothing is better than love.
``I absolutely understand what you want to do,`` replied ESME walnut with a very quiet voice when she was sure she had been speaking to the end, and I say nothing other than that we are not as effective as we are deceiving ourselves.
My concern is that, without prior warning, we may find ourselves find how we repeat the mistakes that have only been reported to the WHAT, which is what was supposed to be done.
This time, however, it is not the others that let us abandon our rage and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed with the hands of a pyramid.
To indicate a patient's patience.
``You go too far, ''he said,`` If you call actions as a ``mistake,'' our grandparents may not have done either.
They also go too far when you say that they have missed their ``rage ''and their`` mistrust'' to others.
It should not, in fact, be necessary to remind someone in your position that, when we understand the past, we are talking about protecting the present, not of ``us ''and`` others''.
There was no ``we ''and there were no `other '.
It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.
``When we are honest with ourselves,`` dared ESME to throw, ``no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I do not deny anyone.
Whether or not it was bad, what has happened has been done.
That was at the time.
To do this, nothing more needs to be said - we agree.
And just as no blame must be assigned, it is not necessary to blame, if such a tilt would be appropriate, and if there is a way to wipe it.
But what does the past do if we do not learn from it?
The past is that we forget them.
When I say something about this, let me say something.
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
``I will consider her report,`` He said and he dismissed.
The next day, when they went to work as usual, she was transferred by a motorcycle driver who, like passers-by, was in a kind of ``brutal rage ''at the foot.
There are cases.
Lesotho-Military says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Official officials of the military in Lesotho began to plan a coup to overthrow the government and said that they were opposed to policemen who are accused of the armament of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and said that the country's army occupied his seat in office, occupied by government buildings in the capital of Lesotho.
The Premier brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after reporting attacks.
Military spokesman Major Ntoi said there is de facto no coup d'état, but the military to respond to the threat posed by the police force.
``What happened this morning was that after he had received a number of secret services for the defence forces of Lesotho after he had received a number of secret services, that within the police, some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political and partisan political fanatics who were short of devastating damage,`` he said to Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman, Clayson Monyela, said that military action has given rise to the impression of a crash.
``If no one has claimed to have torn the government through violence, all the reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho are so far signs of a coup, ''he said.
Speakers from the military of Lesotho agreed on Sunday that the soldiers were able to return to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, the Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the governance of Thabanes.
Thabane said he believes that he has become the target of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June, when Thabane's parliamentary meetings were suspended because of the arguments in its unity government.
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government, despite accusations that were different.
Production in the Eurozone
The rise in production in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point of the last 13 months, so a observed study was carried out.
The final Markit Purchasing Department index of the manufacturing industry -LRB- PMI -RRB- fell in August to 50.7, according to a booth of 51.8 in July.
An indication of more than 50 is available.
New orders went back and factories experienced breakdowns in a time of rising tension between the EU and Russia via Ukraine.
The figures meet before the meeting of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to plan a clear plan for dealing with a timid eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that, in the course of this week, the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, would be able to state whether it is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
``Although a little growth is better than no growth, the accelerated impact of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers has become clearer,`` said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The Fabrik-PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU fell at the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46,9.
France remains a custody child, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion into stagnation.
References to the fact that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer active are also not reassuring, ``said Mr. Dobson.
The decline of industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland where PMI rose to 57,3 at the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: ``The best is what you can say for the purchasing department in the eurozone in August that the sector continues to grow. ''
He added, ``In the eurozone, producers in the eurozone seem to be rather difficult to live, and there is uncertainty in many countries, especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, in particular, the confidence of consumers, and it is probably due to the fact that some orders are delayed or even cancelled, especially when it comes to large contracts.
He said that it would be increasingly likely to be that the ECB should finally launch a kind of QE, ``although we suspect that will be limited. ''
The survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people from Chechen militias were taken hostage in a school in Beslan.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who have escaped death at Greueltat in the classroom.
Exactly one decade after the horrific siege of the school of Beslan, 334 people, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors of last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of Greueltat in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell is going to follow it.
Your greatest hope?
The war that Ukraine is now looking for now, and in the children as they die, is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed during the experiment was to climb back into the broken school sports hall
It was photographed and known by Russian star photographer, Dimitri, when she only tried to climb back into the broken school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely puzzled by her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were dead, but they survived.
``A woman told me to run my life, but I could not,`` said Aida then.
My legs were blooded.
I stood up and climbed again to search for my mother.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a series of operations it stopped to heal, but yesterday said: ``The pain returned three months ago.
I am afraid I have to be operated again.
Some grenades are still in my knees.
Your goal is to become a dentist in order to help people, as helped by doctors.
``This tragedy changed my life, but it has not broken up, ''`` It says it.
``This is what happened to me, and that can not change
Once in the year I always go to the sports hall to remember the ones that have stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about this in other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and we dreamed of going to school.
``I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
To a family I think later.
It says that the siege will always remain a part of it, even though the memory of every year becomes somewhat weak.
I am glad that many people in the world are still reminding themselves of our horrors, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the United Kingdom and everywhere.
When I see the photo I see how I return to school, I think many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and help to ensure that this does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball fled in the opinion that his mother was dead.
It was his first school day -LRB- Russians go to school for 7 years -RRB- and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.
When I was more than seven years old, he said: ``Mama told me that I should rise when there was an explosion, and that they keep their hands. ''
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: ``Run. ''
Full of fear if it could be dead, he fled and saw on the way of a winemaking, took it at the hand and fled by a ball.
His father, Vladimir, who closed his son in the arms, said: ``Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said: ``I have not been able to save them. ''
In reality, Tamara was stunned by rain, and with leg injuries in the hospital, for its part, it was believed that her son had died.
After the reunification she said, she said: ``I love joy.
I could not believe it.
He burned in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London after London -LRB- from the meanwhile resolved newspaper News of the World -RRB- to be won by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion.
``This horror follows every day, but I wish I could stop remembering, he said yesterday.
But I can say that it becomes in my memory.
I still know that I immediately threw all my toy guns away.
But now I can play computer games with firescenes, and that is not a problem for me.
``I have no fear of going back into the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, whom I played in the Court, which have not managed outside.
We never say that they have been killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially to the toy shop where I was able to pick everything I wanted and the ride in an open car.
But now he fears places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered.
This horror follows every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me.
``It's so sorry for all those who suffer from Greueln,`` said Damir, who worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I would like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and I hope she will take me to the Training Academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: ``37 children from our neighborhood were killed you can imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London felt when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her Foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting you and her husband in London remember, and like the Damir and me helped me.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borashsch and how to call all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and supported us.
She said: `I always think that this world has not been better in these ten years.
In Ukraine, the war now goes on, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killed.
These are just such children as ours.
I think that for many of the war is a part of the news that they hear when they are bored or are busy.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can not stop to feel that
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the last abominations.
I know he is not happy to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and they use candles.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa, the face turned from us, for hours.
Not sleepy his eyes were open.
I also remember how all of his weapons and other military toys were raised, and Damir is now 17, larger than me, benign, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I have been so sure for a couple of hours that he is dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and I came to the legs, I looked at me, and I saw the hell around me around me, with the rest of the body.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could not have survived.
``I remember that I stopped him,`` Damir, running, go away, ''but I was also sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he has gone away.
And so, in contrast to many others, life continues for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The Young, whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan-over-living Georgij Lyin with his mother, Fatima, after the siege of 2004, on the right an image of Georgij
His bloodstream face was drawn by fear when he burned his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, had him for his first schoolday before she rushed to bring her elder son Vladimir to the university.
``I left the farm for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone, ''`` she remembers.
Not quite, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date, the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no one day where we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it is for a long time, I think it would be yesterday, some scenes from these days have followed me forever.
Nobody will forget that, and I promise you.
Insistent: The image of Georgij -LRB- left -RRB- was one of the most shocking attack of the attack and was immortalised as a statue -LRB- right -RRB-.
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school this day, and he said he wanted to change his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the wine-growing Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden in us at home in the bookshelf.
I understand this, but I also believe that the people of all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: ``It is important that this can never happen again.
``I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People are studying such tragedies over and over again, and they never know the truth.
And now they investigate the crash of these Boeing in Ukraine.
Are we going to know what caused him?
This world is becoming somewhat horrific.
``I ca n't understand how that is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants to be a war, which is how happens?
For ten years, there is nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little.
It attacked my health and I still feel.
For about three or four years, I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
I went back to school in 2004 and I was afraid of every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That is why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st September approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old child.
It is difficult for me to go to the sports hall, but I must do it.
I do not feel as a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget, but I do not.
My life continues.
I finished the school this year and I visit a medical college in Vladikwkaz.
I will be heart chirurg.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not allow me to do so.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgij Faniev, 20
The boy who survived, although he was caught on the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij fanatics were caught in the siege of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was caught in the sports hall and was sitting next to the bomb which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is really a miracle that he has not been killed.
``We feel as if it had been yesterday,`` says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service, but was unable to do so because of the siege.
It is still with me, it is nothing I have left behind me.
I am older and people say that children can easily be able to deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
``In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I actually felt something better, but I can not forget it
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - in the year 2000 - was the first and the only time I went again to the sports hall.
I lost the consciousness.
I will never return to it again and please do not ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous picture.
Wild: Georgij Faniyev today, with a photo by a photo in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I do it every day with me.
My friends know that I am not happy to think about it or speak about it, and they never asked me about school.
Physically, it is good for me.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can do well now.
However, because of my health, I have not been able to study at the FSB's secret school in St Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have also sent my documents and they have replied that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been behind me two years ago.
He learns how to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said: ``I knew I would never tell my children of my experience.
Children should not be aware of this, and of course they should not suffer.
His mother Marina, 42 said: ``This pain never leaves me.
In my soul, it is worse when the anniversary is approaching.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It must be much more intense because it was there and I do not.
I waited at home and I could not help.
I am grateful to God for being returned to me.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that when something comes out of it.
He is a boy, he may be sport, but he can not take part because of his knees.
It has operated on several occasions, it can run, but it does not work.
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget that.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege, and this strengthened only my pain.
I have lost many people whom I knew well and which were expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God has been able to make to me, but my heart is crying for the prayer.
I know of families where new children were born, but also jokes who have never been married.
It is hard to accept that life continues, even if you do n't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I almost can not believe that
We were previously a friendly country, how is it that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine, and many are killed.
If we could only attack and raise all of these rebels - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was worn so was worn by a special command command in safety was worn
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is certainly saved by a Russian special mission -LRB- left -RRB-.
It is ten -LRB- right -RRB- and it does not remember the cruelty at all.
The world held breath in 2004 when Baby Aljona was born in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists allowed them to go, but in their cruelty they held their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister, Kristina, and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, at the age of three, escaped, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderous compound.
Her father Ruslan was married since then and has a little girl with his new wife, Swetlana, to be named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, who is ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown up to an intelligent and happy girl to say neighbours.
``You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children, ''says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come with the tenth anniversary.
They will understand why.

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there are a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point that is like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which are both for about $300.
I recorded these photos with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a watertight camera, be sure to check that the battery compartment is close to the battery.
Place your camera on the photos or videos that you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and recording that optimizes the exposure time for low-lying underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, you can check up until your equipment is fully functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, other to 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our purchasing guide and the ratings of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots because there are many who are not.
Point-to-top cameras have a LCD that allows you to compose images, Action-Cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water and the right picture setting is a matter of luck.
So make you a lot of shots.
When your camera has a friction mode that makes a series of shots with slightly modified exposure settings, you can use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is dramatically worse than you continue to remove from the surface.
If possible, you will stay close to the surface when you are shooting in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice to the country, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor lighting conditions.
It is particularly important when you are working with an action cam: These devices often have a solid wide-angle lens, which means that you need to use a large number of objects if you want to fill in the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things, even in a gigantic organization like the NHS.
As an anaesthesia, he devoted his career to the task of saving patients both the agony of the disease as well as the sets of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife was reminded that it was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and diseases, while the treated are mainly employed with something else: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the person whose suffering began.
``I did not feel, ''he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulties to raise me.
While he was fighting with the pain of the pain, he noticed that he was impatient about his wife Juliet.
``I want to do everything as quickly as later, ''he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for one week, Lawson felt quite unusual without worrying.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago, he was in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was high.
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that attacks the skin of the skin.
As in most cancers, the exact trigger is mostly difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers fall into lung cancer, not all lung cancer has been smokers earlier.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an indicator of asbestos - contact with the fibre, which once was considered to be a ``miracle ''but has now been recognized as lethal.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960 ''s when industry voluntarily committed itself to not using them anymore.
In places where it was still used, only people in certain industries were working directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, room workers, and advertisers for example.
When an industrial hazardous material seems to be at a different age, it does not seem to be worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is today the highlight of a Mesoltheliom-epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in the case of road accidents.
Annual figures of Mesotheliomtodesia since 1980 and likely future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects even though asbestos has been illegal for years -LRB- in 1999, all types of asbestos -RRB- is that a Mesotheliom has been developed for decades.
And the scourge of Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and often still exists in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
Therefore, Mesotheliom knows no class barriers, financial limitations, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protected area.
The parliamentary buildings are contaminated by asbestos.
Also in the hospitals where we are supposed to become healthy have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogens.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber either.
It has actually been difficult to imagine where he may have come to contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
``It looks as if in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years, there was a lot of asbestos. ''
All - students, nurses, doctors and carers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many people are suffering from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
``From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital, and in the last five years of Mesotheliom, he wrote in a letter,`` I am the last one to live. ''
How many are we going to be ill?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55th.
That was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomos die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So we can only repeat what many of us are going to do. ''
Britain's leading expert in Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, is assuming that between 1870 and 2050, when the epidemic in the UK is expected to collapse, more than 90,000 of the disease will be lost.
Most of them do not yet know that they are going to die.
An Asbesmine in Quebec, Canada
A short look at the acts of the courts, which often address claims for compensation, shows the extent to which the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted that Janice Allen accidentally suspended asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she began to work at M & S
Now it has two children in the twenties.
``In front of this matter,`` she says I have never heard of Mesotheliom, I did not really know anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the concept of asbestos does not relate to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word ``asseform, ''a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common of asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floors, pipe insulations, boilerinsulating, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other asbestos forms, but it is nonetheless seen as a ``great health risk ''by the EU and the WHO with possible death.
However, it is more dangerous than the brown asbestos -LRB- Amosit -RRB- and the blue asbestos -LRB- Krokydolith -RRB-.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that ``it is clear that this was a key cause for uniquely high Mesotheliomrats. ''
A staff of Marks & Spencer was placed in the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, to be exposed to asbestos.
Janice Allen may not have seen itself as a typical Mesotheliomancer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their history is not uncommon.
He presented a study of those affected who is saying that ``a significant share of Mesotheliomes was caused by work or asbestos in the environment by means of work or at home by means of asbestos.
Most of these contacts are based on the ``normal use and aging ''building of our buildings.
It looks as if no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people may also have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service powers and pipelines behind Parliament's committees of committees were contaminated by asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be swept up by something as harmless as ``strong air movements ''.
Members of Parliament are often accused of dealing with their own interests, but here it looks as if they are the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the West Minster Palace received a ``clean health certificate '', there is now no doubt that 1 billion of labor has to be spent over several years to renovate Parliament to modernize electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that, after the General elections in 2015, Members will probably be able to meet at the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green benches
The Godmine report also pointed out that ``the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective rules. ''
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost it.
Everything we can do now is waiting.
One person who has never been able to determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
``I have worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positive, ''he says,`` but I can not prove it in my case
It is so difficult to remember all the places where you have worked and the data.
Whatever he remembers is the day of December 2009, when he got some kind of fever.
He was 45, and he carried out surgery in late evening.
Suddenly I had to blow frost.
It suddenly came to mind.
I felt terrible.
I thought the journey would no longer be possible at home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest caused the skin to fall around his lungs.
Like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a Mesotheliom.
He did not work for a month.
Doctors took X-rays from his breast and set Pleurakathether to take liquid from the lungs and test them in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health was slow, and he returned to his job.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned again, often after sporting activity and strong breathing.
In 2011, a patient arrived with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesotheliom.
However, Abbott also did not manage this with his own case.
After all, his patient was older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbotts state deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT-Sscan and X-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after feeling ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the reef and the chest.
I am an optimist.
I mostly go on, ``he says.
To be honest, I have not been so much concerned.
But Rachel, my wife, was concerned.
The result of biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: ``It was said to me that it was Mesotheliom. ''
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan-nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
It was only now that he considered the scale of the epidemic.
``It turned out that asbestos was widespread, especially in large public buildings, where pipes were often isolated by asbestos.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesotheliom meets younger people who have not worked in the traditional professions.
The most dangerous pipes in hospitals in hospitals were under the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the fabric.
But many employees who ate in pedestrian streets from a building to another -LRB- like Andrew Lawson -RRB- or in underground cantons -LRB- as Graham Abbott often did -RRB-, were most likely to be in contact with the toxic substances.
It is evident that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but they are threatening to treat doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Pupils made their petals on asbestos mats.
And it does not just affect hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and cities because of its fabulous isolated and flame retardant properties.
There are also schools in schools.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
In all of the country, in thousands of chemicals, students have switched their petals to asbestos mats.
On websites, the issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed.
And in the meantime, so many innocent objects are contained in our houses such as floors or floors of the floors by default.
``It is an industrialist that is included in much of our properties, ''says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that fell by a woman concerned was the demolition of a garrison in the 1970 ''s.
Therefore, you will be able to adjust how you will pull your seat.
The impact of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable is immense.
``It takes a while to process it, ''says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and I tried to continue doing, but I noticed that I could not focus on what I did.
I have been in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and I had to take care of myself.
Yes, I will not see another Christmas.
The greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he reminds himself of how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to come to.
``It was very difficult to record everything,`` he says.
``I asked my doctor, how long did I have a question?
And there were about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, ``Na me, I will not see another Christmas.
That was the way it was. ''
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our lifeless mechanism - the breathing itself - that is caused by lethal cancer.
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is broken and the fibres are inhaled, they can set themselves in the nib coat, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the nib coat and can trigger cell mutations.
``The problem arises with the inhaled incubation fibres,`` Professor Tom Treasure, a heart of the Thorax, ''who switched to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital.
As soon as the asks reach lung tissue, Treasure says they are pushed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From the beginning, it is from the beginning of invasiv.
The usual options for other cancers do not work with Mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotter.
Some say they are worth trying.
Treasure denies this.
``You can not cut the breast coat, ''he says him
They do not come out of the knife with the knife.
In the meantime, cancer is not very good for chemotherapy, ``the effect demonstrates, ''but it does not heal.
``sometimes there are long-term survivors, ''Treasure says.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients are actually living for long than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott arrived in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consulting office for fellow affected after his diagnosis.
``hello, cancer central, ''he was happy to call.
``He was very positive, ''says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would take four months to prolong their lives only for a month.
``I was desperate, ''he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson managed to make things appear in a more positive light. ''
After the advice of several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunsky, heart of the Thorax specialist.
``We had an advantage by not having to be expelled, I just called and got a date, ''`` Graham said.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and would have to wait for treatment.
Money is vital to Mesotheliom sufferers in order to be able to take advantage of the best available therapies.
If, after all, these treatments inevitably fail, many face another financial concern - the future of the families that they leave.
And thus they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan by Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
``It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health, ''says Morgan.
But what has changed in the 1960s has changed that one recognized that a very low burden was also a risk to health.
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually put their case, but it was not what Morgan calls ``full compensation ''because Lawson was unable to prove with complete certainty that his Mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, a spokesman of Guy's confirmed that ``the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990 ''.
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is for Mesotheliom sufferers who seek to compensate for compensation, an enormous problem that may be associated with the deadly detention of a company or a job - decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
As a response to this, there were clear new legislation in this year which makes it easier for Mesotheliom-sufferers to redress compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a fund of 350 million supported by the insurance industry for all that was diagnosed after July 2012, but no one could be able to sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80% of what a court could have been able to speak in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 pounds.
About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.
Like so many Mesotheliom, Andrew Morgan thinks that 350 million is a ``very good job ''of the insurance industry.
``This is a deal of insurers for insurers,`` he says.
Mike Penning, Minister for Labour, also admitted that the law was not perfect.
However, in the face of seven death victims, it was necessary to take urgent action every day in the face of seven death victims.
``People are suffering so much and they need help today,`` said Walking during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act of December last year.
At this time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After the first consultation, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation which he expected in contrast to Tom Treasure to have a positive effect.
This has been accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent with the Lang-Lazdunsky.
Abbott felt stronger.
``This is of course the most important thing, ''says Abbott.
This can be seen again and again in patients.
There is something to do with you.
When you catch up, you get worse.
Graham Abbott suspended the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of illness.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancers around my chest.
I have just been 50.
That is not a threat to life.
That is viable.
Again, Abbott withdrew six chemotherapy cycles.
There is now no trace of the tumors.
But the process is physical and psychological.
You have to think about practical things - about the money if I'm no more, for example, or my wife will show how the boom time setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
They must look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.
``For parents, that is difficult, ''says he.
It is hard to know what one should say and how much should be said.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I would have a disease that I would not be old.
They reacted in different ways.
Tamsin is very sociable and unwieldy.
She told it to her friends and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was more cautious.
She did not say much.
Such discussions are something that all cancer patients must do.
But such talks are not animated by hope, not by hope of survival, not by hope.
The disease -LRB- as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould -RRB- brings a solid security.

China denies Hong Kong's right to call government, accusing protesters.
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate.
This is likely to be the long awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists drank planning and mobilization within a few hours of the announcement.
In principle, the decision of the Chinese National Congress allows communist leaders to reject all candidates who are not powerless.
``This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry, ''said lawyer, Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing promised.
You have lied to the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be chaotic.
Since 1997, when the UK has returned to the Chinese to control Hong Kong, Beijing has promised to let its inhabitants choose the seat of government from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong a right to vote, but the decision also makes clear that China's leaders remain firmly held by a close by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates should be admitted with love for the land and love with Hong Kong.
The decision follows a summer where some of the biggest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong have been in place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace Movement, whose organizers have threatened to expel the financial district, is refusing to expel the financial district if Beijing does not allow it to vote for genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within a few hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters in the rain met in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that they planned in the coming weeks of protest.
However, they made no reference to this, which seemed to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers informed that the movement was considering the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, that an action that should only take place when all of the chances of dialogue are exhausted is not available, or if there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that all of the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and there were stronger security measures on Sunday before the government building, which includes police forces and barricades.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The supply of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
Moreover, fear that Hong Kong's values are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing is growing.
Some were critical of the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central-Movement, as they threaten business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
``The protests they are talking about could do a great deal of economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last,`` legal expert Regine Ip, who has criticized the movement for a long time.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media recently reported about the democratic activists in Hong Kong as a subversive agent controlled by Western powers.
In this summer of organised activists, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the right of election that participated in 78 000 people - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands attended one of the greatest democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school leavers in the USA is now transferred to the universities where freshmen are offered with the private aircraft.
We are glad to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxurious travel service of the United Kingdom to students of today.
In order to be able to reach a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport forecasts such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Stewart also admitted that the service had a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who, otherwise, would have to feed their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A business spokesman said that there were no new bookings as the service was only introduced but added that ``students would book the service in the coming weeks.
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of 9,000 £per year, it would expect a market for this offer.
Students are very different from the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to have a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
The National Student Union criticized the service as opposed.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the NUS for higher education said: ``This offer seems totally separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month with their studies see a crisis of living costs, as the available grants in the form of credits and grants do not keep with the heavily rising invoices for the easiest way of life before they can think at all about spending thousands of pounds for something as little as the arrival at the student residence.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson at the beginning of this month.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sangen, ``hands high, did not shoot,`` while they were waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussion of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators are putting gender before race when it comes to raising reproductive and income inequality.
But, while tensions in the Middle East rose and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that white women responded to the race by white women.
In comparison with the responses of black women, shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays with titles like ``thinking about Ferguson of a white woman ''and`` feminism does not only revolve around the oppression of women'' relatively late.
For Perez, however, that meant an important change.
``I do not think many people in feminism find many people who speak about the white, and privileges speak in such a classic way,`` they said.
People felt compelled to say something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are facing, and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnically, it must be expressed.
For English professors of Coritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson has had problems that are exposed to black American women every day, but which are not regarded as ``women's ''in the cultural sphere.
``I can publish something on Facebook about me and my partner, and I get 150 leagues of all, ''`` said Mitchell.
When I say something about how ferns are under siege in their own country, the silence is stunned.
``How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public sphere? ''
For black women such as Mitchell, who studied race, gender, and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women are now joining the topics of race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, professor for women and gender research at George Mason University, says that its predecessors did the opposite.
``Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were yellow and the explanatory statement was almost always the rape of a white woman,`` said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynchmurder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women's right like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in late 19th century and found that the fight for the right to vote could only be successful for one group: Women or Black.
``They met the decision to apply for the right of women to vote, and the right to the right to vote for Black should come later,`` said Hattery.
When you remember those things, one with power is aware of why coloured women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade to organize white women against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was born almost 40 years after the original request for help from pages of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played Fangen with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
``It would not be great if the activists who possess such traditional feminist platforms have the right to education of a child as serious as they do with the right to contraception, ''asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who built their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives now try to understand what that means.
The well known white feminist activist Gloria Stone on Facebook went to Facebook and published a special article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, where she calls for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.
``I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger that is inherent to the body, and opinions on race that are very different in public surveys will lead to change,`` wrote Stone.
Although Stone stands for something like intersectional feminism, some of their comments on the racial theme in America are perplexed by some of their comments on the issue of racial concern.
Christina Sommer, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of ``Who stole feminism ''said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men,`` are far more vulnerable than their sisters.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help help vulnerable to young black and hispanic men help, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the fore of mainstream feminist.
After the US border police adopted almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is again coming to the surface - this time as a women's.
Andrea Mercado, co-leader of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that if you look at the subject as an important female, she must only publish the stories of immigrant women as an important female.
``These speak for themselves, ''said Mercado.
When the vast majority of labor visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
``These stories find a follow-up to women's organisations, ''said they.
``pig house ''in Ipswich stands for sales
The image of a house that stands for sale was removed from property maklets when it became clear that it showed a lot of pigs that had made it in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - one that was also one of them, that his head had to bet on a sofa.
Real estate brokers Connells said that the pig on the photo is the pet of the owner.
``The photo was released in error and it has since been removed, ''said a speaker of the company.
In the detail of the house, Connells described the former gathering as a ``unique family house with a bedroom. ''
Although the broker has removed the image from the site, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house caused interest in the social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.

A pilot player from Harvey is this month!
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth lasts with a lucky winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.

Leonidas asked in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only the gladiators stood in Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who had to resist the rain and who were able to impress themselves from the historical spectacle.
There were a colorful range of illustrations, performances, games, exhibition houses and information about the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force of the gladiatorial school ``Amor Mortis, ''which took advantage of every rain break to demonstrate its robust campaign of combat in the arena that was equipped with soft sand.
Gladiator owners ``Leonidas ''proved to be a humorous and expert presentation and sent his men in the ring in the ring to the heroic battle in different gladiaries.
First of all, there were the ``provocators ''on the series with a rectangle and a short distance as well as leg rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the ``Essedarii ''with chest of chest, short legs, and litter, as well as iron gladiator helmet, slippers and armchair.
The appearance of ``Retiro, ''which came against the`` Secutor,'' was particularly impressive in the appearance of the ``Retiro, ''which joined forces against the`` Secutor'' and had recently fought a battle against Burma.
As it was necessary to pull the swords of metal, the shields and the worm flocked through the arena that a fear and bange could be able to cope with the health of gladiators.
However, the imposing ``Summa Rudis, ''the Muslim referee, had an always attentive eye.
``We wanted to revive Roman life and we were able to experience the culture of the Roman period, ''explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the Association of Friends of Roman Channel, explained the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the park for a day was an ``Oppidum Roman, ''a Roman town like vice president of Claus.
After all, the Romans have brought not only the war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we admire today.
The remains of this were also seen in the Romans ''day, for example ``Aquino Mineral marble'' from the 11 m high and 1400 m long Roman canal bridge, which once stood near the ventilation.
The Frontinus Society once and now directed the water and power supply, and now Petra Fricke knew about it: ``We are still making use of the knowledge of that.
This was also confirmed by a graduate engineer, Ralph Heiten, from the ``Engineering Team Two ''from Rheinbach, presenting the measurement instruments of the Romans like Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations of 1894 as well as bricks from the original reflector.
Also the foot impressions that had been left by wolf and fox two years ago had been left in the foot before burning them.
In 2011, the Office for the Conservation of Ground had dug the remains of a Roman villa in the industrial park of Nord in Rheinbach in 2011.
One found the walls of an economic building to be painted with a darre for drying from cereals and to the mast.
The building was probably owned by a Villa Rustica, an agricultural commodity that explained the archaeological site of Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass pipeline, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa has probably existed from the first to the fourth century until the arrival of the German in the then Roman Rhineland, which is believed to be Morscheiser.
The children were also employed by the Roman winds of wind, in line with today's Mühlspiel, or they wrote how Roman pupils wrote their names with metal handles on wax boards.
At the booth of the Romans Zülpich allowed the children to lay mosaics at the stand of the glass museum of Rheinbach Glasmosa and to use a heavy wheat mill from stone at the stand of the natural centre of Eifel Nettersheim, in order to warn the flour for a bread or a cereals.
With the original Roman trip that was built by two cold flowers, the visitors went through the park through the theme park and came to the impressive state of the city, presenting the results of its ``Römer project twoies. ''
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be involved in the 20th century of 2014 to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and historical associations, as well as the Wachtberger Hiking Association, the association association and the world of football, Oberbachem offers thematic hikes, lecture, cookery evenings, guided tours for school classes and a reminder of the Roman history of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionite from his work on the dependent Wachtberg will tell you to present plants as living thinkers from the Roman age and offer a funny lesson in the field of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger ``Germanen ''and the Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, often not visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be discovered again.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation to the fund of the Bercumer Matronenza will be remembered in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic that is burdened by West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies walk away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rotates in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has placed the region hard.
Some international companies are also at a distance.
``The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one, ''says the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest hit
``It is a total disaster, we lose very much money, ''says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second largest market in Liberias of Liberia.
The market will only be able to buy who wants to buy food or food against Ebola.
Liberia is hit hardest by the virus, and here the fever fell more than 600.
The health authorities recently declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died; thousands of others have disappeared.
Foreign companies attract employees
Wherever it comes to resource-rich countries, companies are doing business.
Foreign companies such as Arcelor Mittal are drawing their employees out, and several international airlines are no longer in charge of the affected regions.
Domestic traders and farmers are also responding: Few merchants are still leaving their homes to obtain supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia which are located in quarantine, among other things, are the cocoa and coffee beans that are important to export.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
There is nothing short of food.
``People are going to travel less and less, ''says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.
The man for example, who usually goes to the market and sells its vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: Food will be scarce.
In the markets, stocks of basic foods like rice are waning.
At the same time, the region that is heavily dependent on international firms is threatening an image shop - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international firms avoid the area for long, says Philippe Hugon from the French think tank Iris.
What is important is how far the virus will spread and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, ''Hugon warns.
The disease also has an impact on states that are struggling to cope.
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the states concerned.
The credit rating agency, Moody's, fears that their budgets are strong on high spending on the health system and additional to the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million -LRB- 45 million euros -RRB-.
The impact is already felt in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the Southern Niger Delta has not been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home from fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels also return significantly.
To protect Your 50th Anniversary
The ``Tannenwald ''Berngau association is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12th to 14th September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, preparations are being made for the 50-year-old foundation from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday, September 12, a great entertainment evening with the group ``Dorfrocker. ''

In the afternoon there is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gauck.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festivals with their Dirndln.
Festkapelle is the castle chapel of Berngau.
The patronage has taken over mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name ``Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau ''dates back to 1907, when the Association was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime had initiated the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Until 1964 there were 19 young men found again on April 30 in the shop of Lukas the ``new ''Schützenverein`` Tannenwald'' of Berngau.
Charles March and Adolf Ried conducted the Association as a protector through a difficult start, where it was primarily a matter of finding a club and installing the shooting.
In the autumn of 1965, the department started to compete with two teams in the camp of Leininger in autumn 1965.
In the following years the sports protection that had now been organized in seven teams was established in all classes up to 1.
For the first time in 1980, Rudi Meier achieved the name of the Association of Purzelten and the magic of 380 rings.
As the performance of active guards increased, the number of members has also been positively developed.
When the Association of Leininger did not meet the demands of a modern protectorate, the Executive Board under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new ``Landgasthof Härteis. ''
After a working performance of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988, pastor was awarded the priest of the Church's blessing on 8th May in 1988.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaushoot, associated with the solemn funeral of the new shield in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary of founding.
In 1995 a group of fans was founded.
Josef narrow-zl became a member of Böllert.
A great challenge for the ``Böllerer ''and for the association as a whole was the focus of the Bavarian Böll meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the Association have modernised the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof, bringing it to the state of the art.
Eleven Team in Ritten Race
It is also possible to see the sporting achievements of the Schützenverein.
In total, eleven teams are currently participating in the race races: Six of the team of air guns, an airgun crew, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two slots.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Degree and Kerstin Keller has risen to the county league in the round of 2013 @/@ 14.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml rose to the Gauoberleague by the Gauleague Nord.
In addition to shooting sport, events such as bockering, carnival and royal ball have a tradition of the club.
With this, the guards are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers from accident in return to the circuit.
Tony Stewarts's return to the circuit ended in half way by his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went to the wall for the second time after his right front in round 172 burst and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his shameful car to the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader, Chad Johnston, said that his 14-year-old team was disappointed, but he is now concentrating on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
``I wish we had a better use and a better result for him,`` said Johnston.
We drive to Richmond and we hope we can do better there.
Stewart went earlier at the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch in a wall and had to repair the rights of his car.
``I have been talking to a good result with good hopes today,`` said Johnston and I added: ``It just did not work. ''
Not long after the second accident, Stewarts car was loaded in the locks and the team had been packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart had to hit three NASCAR sprint cup races after his car hit another driver at an Aschenbahn race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in persecution.
He returned to his job, while an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. was investigated during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities informed that investigations will last at least two weeks for the cause of the accident.
No decision has yet been made to see whether Stewart has to charge a charge.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12, Stewart had just arrived in the first 10 and was temporarily in place.
After a reboot in round 122, fell bushs.
Cars with No 18 excluding control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, while both cars drove against the wall.
Stewart continued to drive, but he fell back in the age of 21.

Ukrainian Army has given up airport by Luhansk
In the Ostukraine, pror-Russian fighters are still on the march.
After severe battles where Russian tanks were allegedly involved, the Ukrainian army gave up Monday, the airport of rebel stronghold Luhansk.
The army also admitted that seven soldiers have been killed in the last 24 hours.

NATO is not going to break its agreement with Russia as a result of the Ukraine crisis as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is in line with the founding agreement of the 1997 NATO Council.
The NATO boss, however, accused Russia of being a blatant breach of the agreement.
``Today we need to face up to reality that Russia does not consider NATO to be a partner, ''Rasmussen says.
Documents and opinions from the Russian side show that ``they see us as enemies. ''

Kiev and Moscow, with a number of new gas negotiations
According to official data, Russia and Ukraine have agreed to new talks on the settlement of their gas strikes.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still waiting for the European Union to decide whether it will also be able to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has not had a fuel from Russia for weeks.

Merkel speaks a word of power: Tolls will be ``clear ''
The Chancellor is once again committed to doing so.
However, it is not a licence for all complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the passenger toll have made the CSU increasingly strong.
After persistent opposition from its CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken in favour of introducing a passenger toll.
``To be clear, it stands in the Treaty of Coalition, and it will come, ''said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU leaders in Berlin.
But Merkel did not agree on a detailed model for the time being.
The black and red state of government is called ``certain parameters. ''
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt -LRB- CSU -RRB- has put forward a proposal and is now working on this.
However, the NRW CDU insists on its ``no ''toll on all roads.
Merkel, also known as Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble -LRB- CDU -RRB-, was constructively involved in the deliberations for a draft law.
Beyond the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other ways of enabling more private capital to invest in infrastructure, for example in terms of broadband.
``There is nothing special about this, ''Schäuble omitted to comment on a mirror on Sunday, his house validates an own approach to pay motorway investors with tolls - after the election of 2017.
CSU-CEO Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the cabinet.
The third party's objections were confirmed.
``The coalition contract never came out of it, ''said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDULands -LRB- Federal Republic of Germany -RRB-.
To that extent, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that the issue should be discussed.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDURural associations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
In the background, there are fears that a toll would affect small border traffic to neighbouring states.
Seehofer had asked for a number of members of the CDU Coalition to score criticism from the ranks of the CDU coalition.
The left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
``The Murks-toll is dead, ''said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the`` New Orleans'' newspaper -LRB- Monday -RRB-.
``With the toll fails to fail the minister, ''says Dobrindt who wants to introduce a vignette on all German roads to launch the 2016.
However, according to the association agreement, domestic car owners are not permitted to be charged.
This is why they are supposed to receive full compensation for the toll via the motor tax.
However, the model must not penalise foreign drivers according to EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often incorrectly diagnosed
A britin says she thought as a result of misdiagnosis for many years that it would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had to live only a few years after she was diagnosed with another illness.
They actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease -LRB- CMT -RRB- - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnosis is a frequent problem for people with CMT because there is so little to know about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders, such as muscle weakness, an insecure gear, and cura.
The disease is incurable and progressive, and this means that the symptoms of time are worse.
When Rodgers was 13, they believed that they would be responsible for Friedreich-Ataxie -LRB- IAs -RRB- - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought they would sit in a wheelchair before they would die before their 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who are 51 years old, said: ``As a child I knew I was not able to do the same as the other.
I fell steadily and everything took me longer.
I have never been able to drive with the other children, or skateboard in the school has often been because of my way to walk and run.
Rodgers said that in the age of 13, after several operations to discharge their Achilles and stretch their feet, they saw when their doctor had left the room and read that they had to suffer from IAs.
``I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I have not told that to anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA-society,`` said it.
When I received a reply, I was shocked and I was panelled.
I thought I would be with 18 in a wheelchair, and with 25, and slowly all my abilities would lose.
I made it alone with me and I planned my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, she became clear that her skills had not had to be as strong as she had imagined, and she asked her doctor.
He just stood up, and I was able to say, and I said, ``My love, I do not think you had that, otherwise you will now already in a wheelchair. ''
I think you have something far less than that.
After some genetic tests the CMT was detected.
``When he told me what CMT was, I felt as if I was a winning, ''she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-A-food month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfieldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireman since the closure of the previous act of troops.
For almost ten years, the former force of troops in Münsingen has no longer been shot.
Nevertheless, every month in the heart of the Biosphere Reserve of Swabian alb comes every month.
The grenades are sometimes as dangerous as they have to be sprayed on the ground.
In the heart of the Biosphere, there is one who comes to the heart of the area of the Biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot on the Münsingen troops fell at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares of land are the central part of the Biosphere Reserve of Swabian Alb, opening on 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on businessmen in the area of Washington is rising with economic recovery
Economic recovery means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
Government and local tax exemptions for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published survey of last week, and firms in the area of Washington were no exception.
Companies in District District, Maryland, and Virginia disbursed $27.6 billion in government and local authorities in the financial year of 2013, a 3.8% increase compared with 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state-owned and local tax burden of companies rose by 4.3% last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9% in the year, and it has been the third year of growth after several years of falling down in 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes rose more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, so that the study was carried out by the Ernst & Young with the focus on state taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half the tax revenues of the District, 56%, come from corporate taxes, while 36% of the revenue comes from firms.
With 28% of GDP, Virginia has the lowest tax revenues from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the real estate values of companies, researchers say what led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7% this year in terms of rates of growth of less than 1%.
While much of these gains came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to meet Washington.
Together with companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia, more than $10 billion in public and local real estate taxes totaled 4.2% in comparison to $9.6 billion in comparison to $9.6 billion.
But the apparent recovery in property values is not effective in the rise of national and local tax revenues, as property taxes amount to just over one fifth of companies ''tax decisions.
Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their national and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
``In Maryland, the following is happening: A large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either the property of the government or non-profit-making organizations that do not pay property taxes, ''said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other states offer.
Companies ''recent recovery in tax revenue can not be compensated by the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to recover, so that the data can recover.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at government organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland accounted for $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not rise equally in all three places.
The rise in the district was equivalent to 4,3% of the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported an above-average tax of 4.1 percent.
With 6% in all three areas of office, Virginia has significantly less corporate income taxes -LRB- in all three there are fixed rates of corporate tax rates -RRB-.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and a district with a relatively high rate of 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower government and local corporate taxes would be required, while a better fiscal climate prevails than in Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5% next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's income tax rate by 2017 by 2017 to 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in Washington seem to be better off, and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes, in other words the latest study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid by small businessmen as personal income taxes, - a transitional structure that is organized by most small businesses - in the District, Maryland, and Virginia, last year rose by 20% to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes across the country will probably last this year, with an increase in the overall increase in income tax revenues for the state and the local governments by 6.3% in the first three quarters of 2014, compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the area of Washington may lag behind when the federal government spending cuts affect the labor market in the region.
Partner City: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and Malz - a popular combination in China.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's sister town in China is now looking for a brewery and is also hoping for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - is the urgent desire for officials in China.
``We would be very glad if a German brewery were to settle in our city, ''said vice secretary of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week visiting a SPD-delegation in his city.
Time and again, China's ruling Communist Party has returned to this concern of the twelve-million metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also known in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
That is why people also used to be able to afford to buy German beer.
The Hessische SPD-Chairman Thorsten Schäfer Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he was going to be sent to Germany by a possible partner for the project.
``For beer, it does not need much: Good water, cereals, and joy of life, ''added lunch with the party top in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already served Mr. Li, flattering the host.
As a result, Guangzhou, based in Guangzhou, Germany, came to the station with a red wine that was served at dinner.
The Chinese brand of Tsingamo is returning to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity of goods.
More business
A second wish by the Chinese host would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice President Li said.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 it was cancelled for economic reasons.
``It would be worth rewarding, ''local politicians were convinced.
``Trade between our two cities continues to grow. ''
At present, passengers would have to take the detours of Changsha in the province of Hunan.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for flight connections.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, stressed this wish when talking to the Social Democrats.
``This is a very good idea, ''said Schäfer Gümbel - the Chinese governor of Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany.
Well-maintained partnership
Guangzhou's empty deputy leader hopes that Frankfurt will be able to attend a partnership meeting next year.
Li was already on the Main, but he was not in this position yet.
He came to office this year, after his predecessor was promoted from office for allegations of corruption.
The local party chef Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the authorities in Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against the corruption of the party and the administration that is enforced by the state of state, Xi Jinping.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked in front of his party career for an American undertaking, which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before he took office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top manager in Fujian, where the car VW created a large work.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometre of Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis in the heart of the world is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen.
In the coming year it would like to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, Li reported.
The family of Joan Rivers ``expresses the thumbs
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for a hospital in New York City since it was delivered to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter was hopeful that the 81-year-old recovered from her illness.
``Thank you for your continued love and support, ''said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We are all pressing the thumbs.
Her mother was delivered on Thursday after an emergency in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in Mount Sinai Hospital.
The doctors consider them to be deliberately followed and carefully monitored until they are more satisfied with their state of affairs that continues to be described as ``serious. ''
The reaction came from many pages, including in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaner and rising wages
In the future, more stringent environmental standards apply to cars and dams that are in trade today.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new dust cleaners receive a label from 1 September to a label where the buyer can see central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, in the category of pollutants ``Euro 6 ''applies more stringent nitrogen oxide values.
In addition, there are more money to buy: They receive a single wage of EUR 10,25 per day.
Amazon buys TBE for $1.04 billion.
Amazon has just confirmed what information had been reported on Monday morning: The online retailer and video producer and a variety of other things - buys the Videostreaming service TCheck for $1.04 billion -LRB- 970 million USD -RRB-.
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Tswitches, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of TB to Google's video service was decided by Google for a cool billion, and the cooperation also appeared of course.
TPlug, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their Bravourpieces in games, a ``YouTube for live games, ''
The Twitter interface.
And ``let's play, ''a video genre in which better know the -LRB- usually older -RRB- games to give a painting of secret science, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is precisely that YouTube is often called when you want to describe tumbles, so the news that wanted to buy YouTube Twatch was somewhat bored, a textbook example of an established technology that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come into existence, because the company reported that it was prepared to pay as much as Amazon.
All that we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet shear, President of Tecker: ``We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get faster. ''
Another secret is, to be honest, the incredible success of TPlug.
For snobs like me who say they prefer to drive sport than to do so, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes from watching others in the game, instead of taking the control panel in hand.
It is one thing to watch a friend at 3 in the morning over the shoulder, while it is easy to see by resident Evil, and something quite different, when he can see how he is shot 20 times in Call of Duty in Call of Duty.
You could now see all of these games.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego-games, so without control of the eye, they can be a good recipe for headache.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger banners of our electronic age are doing whole in record time are entertaining.
But as long as not a Game or Humorvirtuosis is involved, his Twitter channel is probably not so interesting.
But what are sceptics what I know about it?
TAFC is called 55 million per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet transport.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make it?
It is hard to imagine that TStop is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video, which would be easy to swallow.
But Topp has something that every business would like to have: Thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers.
As the chairman of Trein, said to say said, Amazon and TSwitch ``believe in the future of gaming, ''`` and the medium does not show signs of a shrink, nor nor does it show - as a spectator sport.
In front of the castle garden there were a lot of fun at the castle's castle.
The concept of the organizers agreed.
Despite the strong rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to open Air-Fest in the castle garden.
At times it was necessary to stop the entry.
``This was annoying, ''said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
It is a great place to relax.
Out of two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name of Amula.
For the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten should be able to radiate light by the day and the evening through several shows.
Yes, and the fun comes anyway from your own.
This was already evident in the early morning when the first visitors came to the Open Air.
A feast for generations had been promised by the organizers.
And that is what they have achieved.
There were a lot around the castle gardens, but there were also guests from the closer and closer area of the castle.
They followed the first live performances that they enjoyed cool drinks, they enjoyed cool drinks, and they were happy to enjoy pure relaxation.
And that across generations.
While one of them was lying on the beach bar in front of the beach bar, there were some of them at one of the hills of wine, in the wine cellar of Vinothek, at the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller ones.
But the volunteers in the true sense of the word had to do all of their hands in the truest sense of the word, in order to become the captain and create imaginative creations in the little faces.
The bigger ones took advantage of the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop that addressed the Goodfoot-crew from salvage.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he met with visitors to the visitors, especially in families who sought the space and dried up.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not end up.
``more people came to be expected, ''said Ron Sem, who spoke of a`` success on the whole line.
That is why a repeat of the big party does not meet us next year.
Although it is necessary to work on the content and size of the event, Sem made clear when it comes to the popular vote on Sunday.
When he was angry, he said it had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little power.
The consequence: Some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate the Salzwedeler spoke of about 1200 visitors who tumble in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound technology.
This was one of the most popular in the world, and this was one of the most popular in the world.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
They were not able to build up the planned Shishah lounges, because the tents were not able to be placed in favour of a tyre cup because of a tyre cup.
``In the coming year they will be in place, ''says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amha-Open Air was more than successful.
And in case of bad weather.
However, the organizers have made a few mistakes that will be lost in the first time, but they have to be eliminated in the second edition.
Also in the social network of Facebook, the organisers have to be critical of criticism.
``sorry, but for twelve euros you have just been expected, ''says Melanie Meier.
``You have unfortunately taken over a little, ''says Ele Zimmermann.
Others do not see the initial problems as such.
I find it very good that some people are not just stupid, but really try to put something on the legs.
To do this, Stephanie writes to the Amula.
Now, the organisers have a year of time to address these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark
That is not what is expected.
Rather, the included part is waiting to be used in the striking building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after construction of the space observation radar Tira is completely renewed.
The new radom will be somewhat smaller than the old, with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
However, the size is still the record of the world.
The final step towards the completion of the new shell is the Kappzer.
The upper part of the old shell is separated and decreased with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is set up.
When the weather comes into play, the action is to be launched this week via the stage.
Participants in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed as much as their icy water was cast over the head, that they injured the bone structure of their face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge went painfully.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had so much learned at Ice-Bucket-Challenge, that she gave up the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK created so much when their icy water was cast over the head, that they violated their face structure.
``The water was so cold that I cried, and while I was the fact, my jaw remained simple, ''said them to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that was not, the jaw was lost, and then I understood that something did not agree.
My mother and my sister saw this also and made laugh almost in the pants, but I had to get into the emergency.
The 20-year-old from the UK was delivered to the hospital to return to the jaw after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of pages on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the Burgfederations going to pull together soon?
Last but not least, there was a union between the two Wolfratshauser Burgundy.
Now we are thinking about potential cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former Chairman of Wolfratshauser Burgfriends, introduced the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.
So far, the positions seemed to be different, as is the case with the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and the possibility of rebuilding it.
Now the two camps are moving: Talks on a common approach are to be held soon.
This is where Torsten Sjöberg -LRB- Burgverein -RRB- and Herbert Piffl -LRB- Burgundy friends -RRB- confirm this at the request of our newspaper.
``I called Mr Piffl and I proposed that we could once come together, ''says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of the associations would be able to pull together again in the future.
That is how visible success has been achieved.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had an eye on the reconstruction of the castle at Bergwald, the castle association around Sjöberg is at the forefront of the area.
Herbert Piffl, chairman of the family of Burgundy, was delighted to hear about the call.
Since the death of Dimal, he is standing in front of the castle.
A new chairman is to be found in a meeting of members in the middle of September.
According to the 74-year-old, the association is currently one of about 40 members.
``After the death of my friend, Richard Dimbath, we have long been able to rest the club activities out of respect. ''This`` thinking'' was necessary to think about how to proceed.
According to Piffl, the new chair should then go to the meeting with the Burgverein.
Until then, the members of the castle would also be able to make a current mood within their group.
There are still no candidates for the presidency, Piffl says.
``But I am confident that someone will find himself, ''he himself does not want to stand because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to continue working on the project.
The different positions on reconstruction will continue to exist in the eyes of Piffls.
He honours Dimbath as a ``missionary, ''who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an aircraft.
They are a tourist magnet due to a high level of participation by the population, as well as volunteers from all over the world.
Piffl: ``I too was sceptical at the beginning.
But in the course of time I am more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward and can be created to create a ``one-stop-shop ''for the city.
Otherwise, there is nothing else.
It would also be possible to finance the project by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors.
``The idea of reconstruction does not just want to be put on board on board, ''said the Burgverein, who may hope that would be something to do in this area.
Their goal of documenting history is important and good.
After that, it could be seen.
Clever ways of saving with Uni-Lehrbuch
Because the cost of translation books for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the Fast-second student submitted a clever austerity idea to Matt Schroeder.
He invented a temporary system for books of students of higher semesters and offered nominal compensation to delay sales.
``My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-Keks,`` said Schroeder, 19 who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required for the last semester would have cost him 430 $, he said.
He gave up $120.
The division told the student on average more than 1,200 $per year for textbooks and for studies that students would have different cost options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as scrap are increasingly the solution for students.
The rental of textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for one semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookshops, announced that the lease of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about one quarter of the books in the College-bookstores were rented in the last spring season, Neebos said Vice-President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased according to the National Association of College Store in Campus-bookstores.
Here is the unique one for the best deals.
Online Buy
Some new books cost only one third of the price for which they are in the campus-book.
The ninth edition of ``vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's costs almost 290 $, at the specialized shop in Chegg.com for 239,99 $-LRB- s -RRB- can be purchased, but it is possible to do this.
Needed to buy
When one of the notes of other or ordinary usage tracks makes no difference, used books are a good option.
To do this, it is necessary to have a look at Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduation student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent on Amazon.com 42 Cents spent on a used edition of Strategic Media Decision: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.
The book was new for 48 $.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to ask their professors whether earlier editions were acceptable.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older editions may often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Bloom.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting out
The rental of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them to some extent, remember to return them and do not want to retain the books after the end of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly purchased book.
For example, for example, a student would be able to rent a seminary for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the terms of the business you rent, also via the penalty fees which may be applicable to the writing of notes, omissions or usage tracks.
Tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books as well as traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a particular period of wholesalers like Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg, you can hire ``about $61 $''for 6 months at Chegg.
Bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best offers as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and professional textbooks can be expensive.
Take a look at every case.
Joe Gault, 29 who will soon attend the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price of books, as it is possible to be sure to find the right textbook.
And before placing an online order, you should consider to check whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the College-bookshop.
Why ``Guardians of the Galaxy ''did not receive a cash prize?
``The Expendables 3 ''by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million in the US, while`` Sin City: A lady to Kill For, played just $12 million of his budget of USD 70 million.
The film ``Sex Tape ''directed at Cameron Diaz, only played $14.6 million in the opening weekend, while children's films are also easy to do with the revenue.
An article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that for children's films the lack of quality may be the reason for the films.
In 2014, Collin called 2014 ``the worst year ''for children's films, and described`` Dragon heads in light made easy 2'' as purely ``functional ''fantasy.
However, in films for a somewhat older target group, it seems as if the quality of films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for every summer film that was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and at least 2000 sheets in the year.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing vision habits and growing popularity of Web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on discos soon, said to the website Hollywood Reporter: ``I think the times change.
We must accept that and not try to buy the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated revenues of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year when sales amounted to $837 million.
During the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the movie studios for focusing too much on the films of comics and predicting a ``nuclear meltdown ''of Hollywood.
In the light of the current slowdown, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, other representatives of the film industry are optimistic, as Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World are expected to be expected in summer 2015.
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline of the cash results recently as simply ``cyclical ''and he said to Hollywood reporters:`` The next summer will be the biggest summer in the cinema at all, and nobody will worry about business.
When the second table tennis area was deleted a few years ago in order to streamline the league division, it was a step in the right direction.
Now the German table tennis has taken up an additional 3rd Bundesliga.
The consequence is that anyone who has not risen has gone down.
That's how the world's highest top team, Torpedo, has avoided the descent, but in the coming season it only takes about five days in the coming season.
It is one of the most popular cities in the world.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Dutch league, as do the boys of the SC Weende.
SG Lengbs and the torpedoe reserve enter the new association league, and there are no longer diaries in the National League.
For the ladies, TTV Geismar plays in the association league, the Torpedo-Second in the National League.
What looks like a better district class is now the new district of the South.
Here are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Booming SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the area of the area, as regional representatives of Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the area class of the TTC II, Rot-white, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and the III, the Board of Directors starts at least in the shape of the row.
Cronies, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here.
In the area of the county, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen @/@ Wöllgraben are running.
With a set of nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district of the SCW boys - there is still a torpedo II - is not complete.
In a county class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Booming SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded RegionsAssociation, the two diaries start with nine teams.
In the western season there are the Rot-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV, and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengller II.
In the East-season, among others, Sattenhausen, Nikolausberg and Landrad-shausen are playing among others.
The Dame-circle league consists of Sattenhausen @/@ Wöllgraben ausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode circle.
What is striking is that none of the six 2.circular classes is achieved, when the innovative and switchable circle will have to think about it.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered to an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people in Cardiff met in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has followed developments for the weekend and talked to demonstrators who went to Belgium from Bridgent.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains
Two youngsters were safely brought to the rope after being caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW after being caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke out in Govett Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday at noon.
Worried relatives asked the police at about 20 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search engine from local police and rescue services broke down and the couple was found at about 23 in the vicinity of the Bridal Veil Waterfalls.
The girl was at the knees and the man fell in and had beaten his head.
Bailouts stayed at the couple at night, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable condition with a hospital in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
About 1000 demonstrators from the PTV building were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, as Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
After half an hour, the station resumed the broadcast.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged equipment in the editor.
Deaths or injuries were not reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the Heads of Government whom they are accusing them of.
The police told us that, around a kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there were about 3000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
After hospital information, a police officer was injured.
On weekends, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to invade Sharifs residence.
They are calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the Army Headquarters, the powerful military called for a political settlement of the conflict to waste without time and apply without force
It was said in the communication: ``The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state. ''
The escalation of violence has fueled concern over intervention by the military, which, in the past, has already been active in the past.
The protests cited by opposition politicians Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qaddafi have lasted since the Independence Day of 14 August.
Sharif rejects a withdrawal.
Khan and Qaddafi had called on their supporters on Sunday to harden.
``We are not going to decline without having to resign, ''said Khan.
Qaddafi was similar to that.
Khan prefers to have won the elections in May last year through fraud.
He is calling for the resignation of Central and the provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and launch new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the area of government.
The demonstrators had initially fled to parliament in a peaceful way until Khan and Qaddafi called them the weekend to invade Sharifs residence.
Hflüdorfer in front of the table matches three of the table after two season wins.
With the 2: 0 on Grödig, a conciliatory end took place for rapid a bitter week on Sunday.
``The victory is very liberating, ''said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an interim president in the Europe League on Thursday.
``The success experience was incredibly important, ''confirmed Captain and Torchere Steffen Hofmann, who met with green white in place three.
Schrammel-dream tor gets the right response to the disappointment of Helsinki with the second season victory and it is with a success experience in the country.
``We wanted to show a positive reaction, ''said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his splendid guide from the Sixties in the 14th minute.
``I thought I had just thought of the whole frying of Thursday and I put him under the bar, ''said the 26-year-old.
When Schrammel met on 13 April 2010 in a federal state house, this was still for Ried.
This is why the first masterpiece in the Rapid-Dress will continue to be remembered.
``For me this is something very special, I am out of the rapid-boy, ''said Schrammel.
As a result of the short-term pool fee of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and made his cause very good.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in mirror.
The gate is worth it, he has already done some assists this year, ''praised Barisic.
The crew shows character Schrammel also the flanks to 2: 0 by Hofmann after good one hour that finally made the decision.
After all, guests could also be able to write to them.
``Thank you luck today, we have had some luck today, ''Shrammel, who played a part in the breakout of performance and results in recent weeks, also noticed:`` The results have not voted, but the playful has always been good in comparison with last year.
Barisic even said that ``in many games it was better than today than it was today - against`` the most powerful team that played in this stadium in this season. ''
The first three since 26 July have therefore proven that the team structure was intact in spite of being intact: ``Today my team has shown that it is a character. ''
For him, it is not so pleasant that ``we have finally played back to zero. ''
A lot of work during the break of land also the fact that with Brian Bieve, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger are several failures to be lamented, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start days, make the victory even more valuable.
``You must not forget this, ''warned Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Buns and Pavelic players,`` which were very stable in recent times.''
So the break of land must therefore be used to tap wounds and raise a little bit in physical area, ''Barisic declared himself to have the five U21 of choice in his ranks.
One who is particularly interested in a break is Captain Hofmann.
He rolls up for the team, goes over pain.
In this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, ''Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his confusion in the 68th minute not only had the structure, but achieved also the second gate.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350, it was the first hit from the game since 2 November 2013 -LRB- 4: 2 on the admira -RRB-.
Hofmann: ``Do not believe that now everything is good,`` ``We have certainly had a little luck, but at some point the happiness must also come back to us.
It was high time, ''said Hofmann.
To be sure, he said he had to concentrate on concentrated work: ``You must not always see this in black and it is white.
We have not played so badly in recent weeks, as has been pointed out.
However, we must not believe that everything is good now.
He was unable to accept the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can help at the moment.
Hofmann said that is true in certain phases.
We had a lot of fun when it comes to doing this.
He regretted the rapid opposition of the category of Magic, as well as the regular gateway of Nutz in the 40min, which had wrongly been incorrectly detected by referees.
The only accusation I can do is that we have not been sufficiently concrete in the direction of Tor in some phases.
That is where we have had too few degrees.
Defending Maximilian Karner, it was similar: ``It has started very badly, but then we have found it pure and we have even made a Tor.
By and large, more would have been said.
There is Ruh in front of this watch.
We showed a mighty tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series ``My piece of Rhöner happiness ''last Friday.
Several of these trees are still in the county, the printed copy is the ``scourges ''above Unterweilebbrunn.
A long walk leads up to the about 600 years of old oak.
It is over to Koppeln, Basalt Stone and Basaltsteinmeeren.
A little bit below the quarry of Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, since it stands.
It is the natural monument that stands out, it stands out over the other trees of the area and it is reminiscent of an amount of more than eight meters above an American mast tree.
A small Buddha on a tree suggests that this is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only hints of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the bishop's archives and questioned older people from Lower Styria to find out what the change with the scourges had to do.
The outcome of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
So, until about 80 years ago, the people of goat should have driven their animals from Unterweilebbrunn out of the arduous fields that were difficult to escape.
At the foot of the tree, the animal guards who came from the rise were to be planted.
In the meantime, the area has gained its importance, because in the meadows there is actually goat's.
The area has also been declared to be the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve.
When you enter the stone collections, you should be careful because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for Crusaders.
A footpath leads from Unterweilebbrunn to the tree which is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are signposted to climb the direction Hochrhön and to invite you to a long walk.
Where is the water?
However, it is very rare to find a water station that is looking for our next job.
There is already a good impression of the building, but in the county we have some historical buildings.
Where is our ``piece of luck ''?
My Rock of Orange

After weeks of diving in Italy, Italy's Prime Minister and European President, Matteo Renzi, won the nomination of his Secretary of State last week to win the nomination of his Secretary of State as chief of the EU's foreign policy, that she will be the successor of Britin Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, like the local newspaper, La Repubblica, considers it to be the vocation of Mogherini, which is also the favourite in the EU, to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He is also expecting a boost for his ``reform package ''in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to be silent on the left party base against him, because Mogherini is assigned this - albeit in a moderate way.
In contrast to the conservative representatives with the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker and the President-in-Office of the Council, Poland Donald Tusk, who was nominated as President-in-Office of the Council, will be appointed in Rome to strike a political balance.
The EU's chief diplomacy at the same time is also a deputy of the President of the Commission.
The agreement of the European Parliament which has yet to be approved is certain to be assured.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would have hardly had an ``important recognition ''of Italy's role in the EU for the nomination of the 41year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party -LRB- PD -RRB-.
La Repubblica is growing optimistic that for almost two decades in leading party offices they have been able to show the ``enormous challenges ''for their ambitions.
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra -LRB- left-wing Democrats -RRB-, which merged with the Catholic Centre Party, Margherita.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth -LRB- European Young Socialists -RRB-.
With the election in 2001 in the party council of the left-wing Democrats, it rose to the high party politics she worked in the foreign policy whose director she became soon.
They occupied traditional foreign policy priorities such as the Middle East, and studies on NATO involvement in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved in a troop quota, used to refer to the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2008.
When Renzi became a prime minister in February 2014, he was appointed by Mogherini as Secretary of State.
When the PD has once again had a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country which contributed to more than 40% of the party's elections in May, as noted in PD-circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The posturing in Brussels, which has too little diplomatic experience in the EU, is lacking in substance in PD.
In Brussels, in particular in Poland and the Baltic States, realistic trends in the way of the crisis in Ukraine are persecuted and diffused as ``a kind of anti-rural course. ''
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian firm, South Stream, where Russian gas should be transported directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine directly to southern Europe, which also serves Italy's energy security.
When Renzi came to Moscow in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow at its first meeting in Berlin.
Photos that they showed with Putin at the shake-hand were recorded in Brussels with indignation, just as they invited the Kremlin boss for an Olympic summit in October.
A total of nine young people began their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes a trainee who has already completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees are active in four fields: Electronics -LRB- three trainees -RRB-, mechatronics -LRB- two -RRB-, tool mechanics -LRB- two -RRB- and procedural mechanics -LRB- two -RRB-.
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Buchl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Oberviechtach, Daniel carefree and Sebastian Zahner from PFremd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously visited major schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday the trainees of all ages as well as the instructors go to Oberammergau, where there is a full day hike and rafting on the program.
The company counts 435 and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees is spread over all years.
The socialists in France should ``keep the mouth, and France to order, ''said François Hollande's main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show ``their love ''for the disputed socialist president, whose cabinet came to a great majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
``It is our duty to stay on its side, ''he said.
As an important gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite harsh demands for a relaxation of the regime of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his co-socialist to ``unite ''with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, and the Minister of Justice have sought to move sand into the transmission in which they met with a meeting of breakaway socialist members of parliament and criticised the Socialist Party for accepting the French ``faith in their future. ''
Navy Le Pen, the far right leader of the National Front, failed to resist the permanent defeat of the Socialists, and said they could not imagine that the new Valls government would keep for longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has no, they are forced to create a new government if the old did not survive a summer.
``and the new will not survive the autumn or winter, ''said Mesmer Le Pen against supporters.
She repeated the call of her party after a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident that he would emerge as the winner in early elections and be prepared for the government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March, and the right-wing National Front was at the EU elections in May.
A survey in the newspaper magazine du Dimanche revealed that 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of crumbling in several rival factions before the end of the presidency's term of office.
Pascal Perrineau, a politician in the Sciences of Po Universität, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy.
``There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel quick to feel that things change,`` warned him.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise in front of a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion
According to experts from the industry, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest crusade provider in the world, leads advanced negotiations for the acquisition of the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would be Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.6 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises, and its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd -LRB- RCL.N -RRB- and Carnival Corp -LRB- CCL.N -RRB-.
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources on Sunday said and they warned that the talks could also end.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC -LRB- APO.N -RRB- also has a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to stay anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
The company, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, a 13% increase compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand name Oceania and Regent, which operates eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa, and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 from $1.2 billion, a 6% increase compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is around $29 billion in total, and in the coming years it is expected to be strengthened by strengthening the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the stock market in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since an $850 million deal.
In its current form in 2000, Norwegian Cruise was founded by a merger with a crusade provider in possession of Genting Bhd -LRB- GENT.KL -RRB-, a leisure and casino group under the control of the Malaysian billionous Lim Kok Thay in 2000.
Apollo invested USD 1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the Stock Exchange in January 2013.
In the end of June, at the end of June, at the end of June, according to approval authorities, 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20% of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held a 8% stake in the company.
Together with the original application documents for Prestige Cruises, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have more than 82% of the prestige of American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A pekingfidelity group moved close to the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law which only allows two or three candidates for the leadership in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first reach the majority support of a Nominating Committee, which is likely to be occupied with pekingloyal members.
This decision makes it almost impossible to vote for opposition democrats, to be able to vote, and to have pro-democracy activists to make their threats true and to unleash Hong Kong's financial space with ``Occupy Central ''protests.
Political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and Chinese party leaders fear that calls for democracy spread to other cities.
After the release of a Beijing White Paper which, in June, outlined China's dominance of Hong Kong, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands of them marched to the city's business district and organised a sit-in there.
Lis survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The deputy chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice-Director of the Office for Foreign Affairs of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted in the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they should meet in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain saw no democratic elements until the final stages of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin calls for Kiev to accept a ``state of government ''with the Ostukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media, claimed that on Sunday, on Sunday, the Ukrainian government stopped fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately began to negotiate the ``statehood ''of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that it would be a part of Russia under the control of the separatist region, but that his status towards Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to Kiev's government to negotiate on equals with pro-Russian insurgents, at the beginning of the riots in the past five months, seems to the strategy: Help for the separatists, and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the Ukrainian government to be able to enable the newly proclaimed region of Novorossiya de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead.
In an interview with the state television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to withdraw territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
In recent times, the Kremlin and the separatists have recently called a ``Novorossija ''or`` New Russia,'' a concept that reminds us of the prerevolutionary gloss of Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who in the wake of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians are hoping for the elections on the 26th, and while governments in civilian communities in the areas that have been held by separatists are hoping to be killed in their illusions in advance, ''Itar-Tass reported.
``We have to start talking quickly, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of the South-East Asia, in order to preserve the interests of the people living there, ''he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to the state of state is to be seen in the context with greater autonomy that has had to be discussed since months of Kiev leaders to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern areas the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, ``because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but it is an internal conflict in Ukraine. ''
The Kremlin's clarification for the correction of the ``misinterpretation ''of Putin's remarks highlighted the leader's leadership of Russia when doing dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, unlike the direct attack of Crimea,, which is the majority of the 2 million inhabitants of ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the regions of Donezk and Luhansk to the Ostukraine, because most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the time before the conflict have resulted in a broad majority in terms of remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy raised by Russian diplomats at international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin the de facto control of an area that connects Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula, which was annexed to the Black Sea five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostowland in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories, and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on the inauguration on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Porosus proposed that Ukrainian legislation should consider, after new elections, amendments to the constitution, which gives them greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose weapons are being blamed for Moscow.
Putin's last request to Kiev to negotiate with the separatists on an equal footing was followed by another of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks have penetrated over the previously peaceful region along the Aegean Sea in the east.
The separatists supported by Russia, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, took over the first step of a campaign to take the strategic coastline to Crimea, the control of Nowoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to support Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, who is between Nowoasovsk and narrow access to the Crimea peninsula.
On Saturday, at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels, Poroanus asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
``We are just in front of a point where there is no return, ''warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not adopt concrete actions, the leadership demanded further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force with an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers last week entered the Donetean region to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, had to withdraw from Kiev on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by Russian incursions in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parachuting hunters who had been captured a week ago in Ukrainian territory, divided Lysenko on Sunday.
Nudist scandal around Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no bones about his anger over hackers, who had presumably stolen his impassioned Gabi Grecko and a Who who is a who who had stolen A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement, after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence has appeared in a hacker scandal for promis on the Internet.
The hackers who are responsible for this probably have more than 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star of the Tribute of panem and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers of Rihanna, Ariana Grande, and Lea Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
By the Australian actors, Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were allegedly also publicised by the way they know.
There are 101 Promis on the list.
The most precious who spent last month with Grecko said to Confidential: ``It is silent. ''
All private letters and images should stay private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and shared with others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, said reports to a news website that the Hack was shameful and that those concerned felt ``injured. ''
The hackers probably have 30 pictures of Palmer with their ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two shots where they are at the top of the pool.
Palmers' films are among those who love to be invincible with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the raised pictures.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ: ``It is a despicable violation of privacy. ''
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: ``hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing different than the selling of Hehlerware. ''
From a purely legal point of view, the distribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and hikers were here yesterday at the 8th Radeln on the Great Feldberg, supporting the association of help for children of cancer.
The tour, which was one of them, was an easy training for the other.
Everyone agreed in one thing: It has been fun.
Thomas Studanski is likely to have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of Oberurseler Brauhaus travelled yesterday with the bike to Feldberg.
For the good cause.
It is easy to get away from the small musculator, especially as it has also made it easy to recognize the participation in the Grand Feldberg in favor of the ``Help for Crebskities Children ''-LRB- Frankfurt -RRB-.
That is a great thing.
``I know now that I can do that! ''
What are the signs of the applet?
Snow, when I would have stopped, had long been found.
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Austrian parliament of Lords, many of the 718 participants raced yesterday in the spring to the mountains yesterday and came close to exhaustion, although they were happy with the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the almost eleven kilometres of long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
The whole in red green politicians from the cycle - red Dress - red bike - made something at the start still at understatement -LRB- ``Every bunch of professionals is the finish! ''-RRB-, however, then proved to be at the mountain, but proved to be half professional and went to the finish after 45 minutes without breathing.
He has also been riding the track in a slide, as well as Nina Kuhn, pressesprecherin of the town of Oberursel, who had together with Frank Grüneisen had to leave.
For the two triathlon athletes the ``Feldberg-Radeln ''was not necessarily a sporting challenge:`` This is about charisma: ``This is about charisma, we would like to get with it - we would have made it anyway today,'' Kuhn says.
On the way, they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy -LRB- 12 -RRB- went to Oberursel in the morning, to return to the heights.
In the morning, at 9 o'clock in the saddle, the director of the Frankfurt was dressed in the saddle, ``made by the Feldberg to roll with fun to home.
It was also a great pleasure to have a look at Fritten-Toni.
For the head of Oberurseler cult kiosks, bike tours via Feldberg are easy to reach.
He hit 40 minutes with its 6,5-kilorace-wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to say, ''said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says he is a ``more ambitious racer. ''
He also has to be that, because he has been on the road with the ``fix up, ''which is also a racing wheel, but no circuit.
That it also went smoothly without a wheel, it proved to be not only the 20 hikers who climbed up over the White Wall, the head of the summit, but also a Jogger who, at a Kordel, had a licence with weights behind him.
When he was a member of the team with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad for safety, he said: ``The kenn from Frankfurt, who trains from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sling of ice, only to pull the sleigh by itself, ''says the man is in some sense his own sling.
The 718 participants - and therefore as many as never before - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The hikers start at 9.30 a.m
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m
Five minutes later, the first mountain bike took place.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association of Radeln on the Great Feldberg, gave the start commands and wished the participants to visit a beautiful trip.
For next year, he hoped that it would be possible to lock the route to the Feldberg to ensure the safety of the participants.
