Rethinking of the very American ideal of human rights as human rights.
The congressmen of Keith Ellison and John Lewis have put forward a proposal for legislation to establish the organisation of trade unions as citizens' rights.
``As trade unions die, the middle class jobs are also dying,`` said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and Vice-Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I am proud to present the Staff Authorised Law with the civil rights of John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal means of discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops such anti-union forces.
The extension of the national law on labour law to create an opportunity for discrimination against workers in the organisation of a trade union in order to sue justice against a civil court for justice, and to obtain compensation or punishment is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative, or at least American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have been facing in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country, Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, expand and maintain labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called for democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions used the creation of a new Japan a role of revenue, they used a language that explicitly recognised that ``the rights of workers are guaranteed in association and common negotiation and action. ''
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff would write the Germans to write a constitution that would help replace Hitler's fascism with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and their voice should rise in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly said: ``The right to set up associations to secure and improve labour and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and any professional or business.
Agreements that limit this right or seek to diminish it are zero and void; it is illegal to do so.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chairmanship of the International Human Rights Commission, which drew up the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors gave a guarantee that ``everybody has the right to form trade unions for the protection of their interests or to join them. ''
For generations, Americans have accepted the basis for human rights of human rights.
When this country told other countries how to shape civilian and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to the founding of a trade union must be protected and that trade union should then be protected from collective negotiations as an equal partner with companies and government bodies.
After these rights in America were under attack, it is indeed very wise to return the American ideal, which means that the working population must have the right to unite and to make itself heard in a free and open society.
How Pastor Martin Luther King said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now all of us know that the workers movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By increasing the living standards of millions of people, work has admirably created a market for industry and has raised the entire nation at unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves it.
History reminds us, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of rights as human rights and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporarily the law that would force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close the closure.
On Sunday, a U.S. judge stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, saying that it would presumably have led to the closure of all five detention centres of the state.
This measure, which was made by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June, was to enter into force on 1 September and would force doctors carrying out abortions to acquire a patient awareness of patients at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to purchase their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that the doctors can temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions while seeking such a right.
``The plaintiff is able to continue working in accordance with the law when they seek to achieve these rights, ''Federal judge John degravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing for the judge is scheduled to bring about a more permanent decision on the law.
Abortion welcomed the decision made in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors take so much time to gain recourse to hospital.
``The decision taken today means that women in Louisiana who want to take care of their health and their rights, say that on behalf of three of the five clinics of the State, Nancy Northup, the President of the Centre for Reproduction, was accused of stopping the law on behalf of three of the five clinics of the State.
It was not clear whether the judgment was also extended to doctors from the two clinics, which did not support the complaint and also requested the right of transfer.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the hospitals remaining in the state to shut down, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
And the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, have agreed that the transfer rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Anti-abortion opponents believe that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some have also welcomed the effects of the closure of hospitals.
Only a doctor who carries out abortion has patients with patients, shared the center of reproductive rights.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to do no more than abortions, the group would no longer be forced to carry out surgery.
In their argument against the judgment, the representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the implementation of abortions, while their applications for the rights of patients would still be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best ways of treatment result in higher death rates caused by egg cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James put a video online for her mother, which in 2007 died of egg stock cancer.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of egg stock cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 stopovers in 2005, stating that only 25 percent were still in life after the diagnosis.
The research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality in mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDER: New medicines could slow down lung and egg cancer.
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of egg rate cancer, existing pretreatment and social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already further advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was at the lowest.
For those living in rural and isolated regions of the state, mortality in mortality was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why outside the city of living women were more likely to die of egg stock cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors.
``This disease is best treated by gynecologic oncologists, and these are usually found in large cities, ''`` she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services, in order to counter the distances, it proposed a strengthening of the service of frozen doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women at their place of residence and to provide treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of the geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term unemployment rate among women in egg stock cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and preferential strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto to Conquer Cancer is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 from the gold coast, discovered that it had an aggressive form of egg stock cancer.
Garden centers are sorry to lose house ownership and we are sorry to hear.
The decline, combined with an increase in the number of farmers under the age of 35, could cause garden centres to lose tens of thousands of pounds per year, if today's young consumers come after a study of HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, the ``core age group for garden products. ''
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount in excess of their garden.
The rise of people who live in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of preparing pre-gardens for parks, and the drop in garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, which is estimated to be €5 billion per year in sale.
In the wider London area, where over a period of six years, the share of homeowners from 61 to 43% has fallen, the least expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people are unable to draw plants.
Guy Barter, chef for RHS, said that ``for example, container plants are very popular because they can bring their plants on a move. ''
The HTA report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the ``golden age ''of the garden retail trade, owing to rising domestic property figures and economic prosperity from the late 1980'' to the middle of the 1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather for unfriendly weather conditions in March and April.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergy Tahirul Qaddafi, continues to go.
In the capital of Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators set up the state TV station PTV.
Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings.
The transmitter placed its operation for about 40 minutes, but it is again sending it again.
At the same time, around 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometre away from it, they were equipped with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police replaced Trenengas.
The demonstrators asked Sharifs to resign, but it rejected it.
Meanwhile, the country's army is calling for a political settlement of the conflict, without wasting time and using it without violence. ''
After a meeting on Sunday evening, the military told the military: ``The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state. ''
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already played a more frequent role.
The opposition politician Imran Khan proposes Premier Sharif to have been deceived by parliamentary voting in May last year.
The protests began to escalate at the weekend, after Khan and Qaddafi called upon their followers to invade Sharifs residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appointed US diplomat on the subject of espionage reports
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has appointed the oldest US diplomat of the country to publish a report on US and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the business leaders of the US embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The mirror as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major activity area for the US and the UK secret services.
According to Turkish intelligence agencies, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dealt with the importance of the report and said that all the major countries turned a blind eye.
A previous report, which was also aimed at Germany's most important secret service in Ankara, resulted in much irritated reactions from the Turkish Government.
Warning strike: Train drivers face consequences for commuters.
The Federal President of the Federal Republic of Germany could also affect the movement of persons in NRW.
For 18 to 21 pm, the event was attended by all of the transport companies all over the world.
The main infringement of the warning strike is that of freight transport.

Said the district leader of the trade union of the German Railways -LRB- GDL -RRB-, Sven SchMitte, in Düsseldorf.
We are counting on a large number of cases.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main infringement of the warning strike is that of freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that everything should be done to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so that it was difficult to anticipate the consequences.
Police Chief of Magaluf of Coraluf
On Friday, the prosecutor presented evidence of blackmail to the office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca for blackmail by police officers and employees of the City of Calvià.
The head of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after the accusations of corruption by businessmen and barowners in the infamous Binge-for-the-counter Hotspot Magaluf.
Following the accusations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the road in which most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located, the main Commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, was taken into custody.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors submitted evidence of blackmail to the office of the prosecutor for the fight against corruption on Friday by police officers and employees of the City of Calvià.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption charges and consulted together with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily newspaper ABC reported that the angry night club owner said that the government's cronies had serious implications for their business.
``It is no longer a matter of money, it is about survival, ''`` one of the business people said to the court.
Let our livelihoods come out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer, Magaluf made international headlines in this summer due to an 18-year-old British tourist who moved to 24 men during a tour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have since tried to stop the illegal behavior of non-alcoholic tourists in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the infamous non-alcoholic drinks.
The Playhouse Club was forced to close a year to close a year, while Playhouse and the Bar Carnage will have to pay a penalty of 55,000 €-LRB- $73.000 $-RRB-.
The tourist area of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British tourists, is also known for a number of accidents under alcohol consumption, including the trend of ``Balconing, ''where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first spring of spring with wet weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport.
The spring has brought a winter surprise to the south of Africa, with intense scenes and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 21 p.m. there were more than 6,6mm of rain rain and 6,6mm, which had already been settled in the night on Sunday.
The final result was the result of a series of short, stormy, including one that began shortly before 20 p.m. and about 10 minutes for nearly 4mm.
After winter last week was for an early dose spring, the temperature in the city on Monday fell to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C
The bad weather conditions probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to end shortly after 7.30 p.m., but it was taken by a blow - a sudden change of wind speed or direction beyond a short distance - and had to run through.
At that time, wind reached about 50 km @/@ h on the ground of Adelaide.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to run through a second landing flight and finally ended up at about 20.40.
Flight delay resulted in delays of some other flights, including an ATM flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C on Tuesday, with possible displays.
Matthew thinks: The highest time to make a big correction.
In view of the technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home home into high-tech switches, our column is Bernd Matthew with an extremely familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this here, my look is on the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone and I think: Boah, like retro that is that?
But there is one reason to do so: If the cable would not be, it would be possible for all listeners to fly around in the house in the shortest possible time, and that would be much more retro.
In any case, it is true that the eceltronic -LRB- eceltronic -RRB-?
No, typos: Electronic is the rule that is the latest of today's electric waste.
And, for example, today there is a tube TV in the living room, which merely says that he is in favour of television.
Why these considerations?
Because the urge made by Ifa on the radio tower this week will once again lead to our absolute incompetence in the fields of electronics.
The Laie, which was blind to washing machines and CD players, now does not even understand the purpose of the devices that spread to it: ``Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies ''promises to let us know what you want to do.
Yes, yes?
What is to be discussed with people who apparently voluntarily spread such Quark?
For example, for about 20 years we have been in favour of linking our House.
This means that the yogurt itself is one that tells us that in the holiday of the Maldives, we know that it is burning in the room of work.
And would it not be wonderful when we get from the office out of the air conditioning on our early arrival?
Yes, but this requires air conditioning.
But a dream is definitely going to come true: We lift our armour, you say ``Saugen! ''and at home leaves the dam.
Let us be wrong.
Everything is running out of nothing less than a revolution: ``The limits between white and brown goods are blurred, ''raunt a branch of industry, you can connect the washing machine with a headphones, the steam will send the weather report and the data bribes show how long the pizza is still needed in the oven, but what nothing is useful because we are in Stau
We also know from everyday practice: When a new electronic device is really needed, the battery is empty.
This is another reason why the spiral cable will also survive the next radio show.
Israeli children returning to Gaza after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas close to Gaza returned to schools on Monday after they had spent the summer in air conditioning, while missile and murderers settled on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and shut down the schools in Gaza, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school start brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities of missile in the south of Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the staff of the ``Pashosh ''children garden, which was taken by a missile made use of the students of Granatsplitter out of the walls.
``We have a bit of fear, but are excited,`` said Ronit Bart, Angut in Kibbutz Saad and also English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that it feels ``a bit funny ''to suddenly return to school.
``It was a difficult time and we did not go out of the House at all, ''she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire of last week, thousands of residents of the border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move away from Gaza in safer areas and to escape the missile and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza in which a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar granate, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education has said, for example, that a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were provisionally accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town of Gaza, which is heavy to be drawn up by the Palestinian attack.
He appealed to the children, learning much and said, ``We will make sure that their knowledge buys and offer security. ''
Israel and Hamas agreed on an open-ended ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire resulted in an immediate end to the fighting; important problems remain unresolved, such as the call for Hamas to lift the Gaza blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel is calling for a disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two of the Israeli soldiers.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to start in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2.100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them, and at least 494 children according to estimates from the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that it is at least half of those who were killed, but it did not provide any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including Thai workers.
Hamas and other combatants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fighting against Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military led more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks were damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people in more than 100 UN schools that were transformed into temporary protection areas.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protected areas and are continuing to fight, the education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
``I hope that the school will soon be open so that we can learn further, so as children in the world and the Jewish children,`` said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl puts NPD-prohibition procedures into question.
In view of the death of the NPD in Saxony, CDsubmarine Thomas Strobl has spoken in favour of an end to the current NPD banning proceedings in front of the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - Laut CDsubmarine of Thomas Strobl should put an end to the current ban on the NPD in front of the Federal Constitutional Court.
``The NPD is worse off than in the last time, ''said Strobl, who is also known as the`` Berliner VolksZeitung'' in Baden-Württemberg.
This is a welcome development in the right direction, and a development that leads me to achieve the result is to combat the NPD politically and not to deal with the Constitutional Court.
In response to the vote on Sunday, the NPD failed at the lowest percentage of the cent.
A first attempt at a ban on the extreme right-wing party was failed in 2003 because, at that time, the protection of the Constitution was also carried out in the NPD lead.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new request in Karlsruhe after lengthy preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not agree.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the end of the day, refugees are now being accommodated in tents.
The head office for refugees in Harburg burst out of all seams.
Now the interior authority has put three tents from the Red Cross next to it.
The regional politicians were only short of information - they are little enthusiastic.
``The Hauruck actions still increase the concerns of the citizens and the district politicians do not give any possibility to contribute constructively to the humane accommodation of refugees, ''said Britta Herrmann, group leader of the Greens at the Harburg County Assembly.
Your party is calling for the district administration of Harburg to provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overfilling in the initial intake are the rush of the helpdesk - and the fact that the authorities can not provide enough seats in follow-up facilities
Many refugees are therefore longer than the regular three months.
The hood has experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for private homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, meaning the RP-data from Monday.
With this increase, the overall rate in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than twice as much as the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research manager of RP Data, Tim Lawless, has said that Sydney and Melbourne are using a two-shared market.
The figures of RP Data show that in Sydney last year, consumer prices increased by 16.1 percent, compared to 11.7% in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by five and six percent on average.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which has been hard hit by cuts in government spending, is only 1.4% of the price of prices.
Mr Lawless further said that, for the coming months, the price of spring would now be an increase in the real estate that would undergo a real test of the market.
``If you look at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast rate of sales and the constantly low interest environment, it is likely that housing prices will continue to rise in the next three months, ''he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he is contrary to the statements made by the Managing Director, peer Medau, and attests to this `as a Feldherr '.
The style of the university is not, so it is in the communication.
For example, the Medau family was already informed about the request of the university in the middle of June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July are definitely wrong, ''he says.
At the same time, however, he points out that the plans do not constitute `preliminary decisions or even decisions', but would say` preferences'.
It was also less dramatic than was feared for the castle, which was less dramatic than was feared for the castle.
It was nine metres wide and it was not mentioned.
It goes to the present state of 5.50 meters, it is a metre more wide than before, ''he says.
The argument of the Medau operator is that it is not possible to make use of it from students of the university in the future.
It is not allocated at all because it is now an intelligent solution that is now intelligently solved in the case of other public parking spaces.
Thinking of residents
According to the university president, the children's crib of the mountains, which is located on the grounds and on their doorstep along the road to the parking deck, is not to be affected by the university president.
On the contrary, it has to bear in mind that this is not just a question of children.
So there is much more to do with the interests of Mr Medau ', Mr Medau,.
Whether the criticism of the daughter of children's crib, with the expansion of the road, would be lost one of the few natural spots of Coburgs, ``the reader itself can decide. ''
At the beginning of October, Pügen l will be able to inform you about the development of the university by 2020.
Peer Medau informed the parents of the kindergarten last week about the College's plans.
Thus, the access for the new car deck is not meant to lead to the campus and to the Friedrich-Stahr-Strasse, but to the Medau-Berg.
This means that the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometre in length.
According to the high bills of the Medan, the traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would become ten-fold.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles on a daily basis.
To date, the city did not wish to speak about the project.
Glandorf comes from Handball Team back.
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Federal State of SG Flensburg-Handeoke led to health problems for this decision.
It is not easy for me to decide; it is over a number of months.
It is for me time to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team, ''the World Champion of 2007 shared on his Facebook page.
Thus, he will deal with a balance sheet of 167 countries and 576 gates for Germany in international retirement.
Now he will no longer be able to attend the new Federal Trainer Dagur Sigurdsson because he wants to go to Torehunt for some years.
With the Islands, which announced his Kader for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf led a long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have also inspired me as much as I am enthusiastic about my longtime players and my successors.
But for my club I would also like to be healthy in the coming years.
In 2012, the left wing had to fear his career.
Because of the problems he had to deal with, he was treated by team doctors of the German Handballys -LRB- DHB -RRB- with a cortisoninjection, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf announced a lawsuit against the team doctor; the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional careers and eleven years go beyond the boundaries of the body.
I have some health sites that I can not ignore
After the three attacks on foot operations that took place in a short time in 2012, I never managed to get my blood pressure right.
Some of the complaints that have been caused arise.
Even at the beginning of the year, I noticed that I controlled my head, but my body can not fool it, ''Glandorf'' in the interview ``Handball Time. ''
For a comeback, it would only be available in absolute emergencies.
``When all tear away, I am always ready to talk, ''the two-fold family explained to the magazine.
However, I can count on one hand for the years in which I can still play a hand.
I must also say that after my long period of hospital in 2012 I became rather devious of my health.
After my career, I would like to go at least than possible.
In addition to the WM-Ttitle 2007 and the winner of the Champions League 2014, he won the EHF-Pokal in 2008 -LRB- HSG Nordhorn -RRB- and 2010 -LRB- TBV Lemgo -RRB-.
In 2012, he also benefited from Flensburg as the European Champion of the Pokalwinner.
German Economy in Spring by 0.2 per cent
The crises around the world have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product declined by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014.
This was shared by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Only the consumption of the economy in the spring of the year continued to decline, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
For the first half of the year, a GDP increase of 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013 was due for the first half of the year.
Horstmar was the point of departure and the goal of the ``Münsterland Mooiste ''was taken by the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
On Sunday, the castle of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch.
The largest cycling network in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called ``Münsterlande-Mooiste. ''
Here you will find the largest cycling tour across the world, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants were grateful for their registration in Jos for the organization of these tours.
This tour was offered to those who are interested in various trade journals.
We come from Den Helder and travel by night to take part in this tour.
We also want to get to know the area of England in this way, ``Let the cyclists know the route through the towns of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration in the club sheim of the Protective Sta.
Katharina went to a small ``peace ''through the city of Wall, where it was also started.
Further, the route, which was awarded for three different categories, led in the direction of Herrenholz through the Schöppinger mountain to Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres of 1,175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometres of altitude and 145 kilometers of 1775 meters have been demonstrated by cyclists.
They were on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer of the company of Heinz Lölfingen was delighted to hear about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it has been a nice experience for all concerned.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents, ''Heinz Lölfingen draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not so many participants, as the organizer had hoped, which was probably based on bad weather forecasts and tragic rain.
``We see ourselves in 2015 again on 30 August or during another weekend, but cyclists promised to return to the heart of the city and the organisers are planning a new one.
He is one of the most difficult of those who love it.
In fact, it is more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Konstantin Wecker, songmaker, pacifist, politess activist, ex-prisoner, into paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more, he wrote his memoirs in Munich on 1 June 1947 and began writing each of the chapters initiated by means of a matching song text.
And he is ruthless: From the Onanie as a high school up to retail theft and drug use, he is not a source of human weakness.
Also to show how he has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also take abstract, but all the more important terms: Dear, soul, Ego, the being in now, spirituality - all that he tries to do so, is very philosophical, but also very personal.
And he also explains his pacifism, his critique of society, his political commitment and, as it did not only show the music, the opera lover -LRB- who became a soul and a rock musician -RRB-, but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the life of Konstantin Wecker closer to the asketic monk, who comes from subtraction, as he says, ``leaving everything out of the way. ''
Between all of the most sensitive views, there are also brief anecdotes to the earth: For example, there are about two of them in one of GIs or a crazy car in which he wanted to create a tree.
Here too he is ruthless.
Lenny Henry: My father has never taken me in the arm.
Has never said ``I love you ''
Henry was one of seven children of a family in Dudley in Dudley in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was worked in a factory was limited.
Henry tested a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work with some difficult childhood moments.
He visited ``many ''therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is sensual about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
He never saw his face, but he only heard his voice: ``Note with the collar.
Let your sister stay in peace.
Go away!
I want to look at cribs.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already out of age when I was a child, went to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious type of type in the corner that read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won an insight into how life was for him.
It is now a bit brighter, but they are dark, rough, deep stylized labyrinthe with floppies and smoke and lots of dust.
My father previously just turned into the bath and then he was able to hear him slowly how he began to sing, because he was able to wash the foundry.
When I was going there, I was aware that he had done so for years to put the meal on the table, and my respect for him was greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without love for his parents.
My father never smashed me; he never said ``I love you. ''
Only when my mother went badly at the end of her life, we began to say ``I love you, I love you, I love to say. ''
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love that he had missed as a child.
Could you stop saying ``I love you?
But ask me to change me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mother.
It is still married with French friends, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mother.
Henrys was a mother of his own mother.
That contributed to her death.
So when I was very busy and symptoms of diabetes showed, my doctor said ``You must be radical.
So I moved this fitness and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henrys career change may well be seen in its elegant and short-lived bar.
Since he was praised by the critics of his Othello, he was captured by the theatre.
It was followed by the comedy of the mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcom and comedy, which filled his busy working life.
He began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His TV career began in the middle of the 1970s. ``I was for a rather long time of the only black Imitator @/@ comedy on television. ''
He learned in the job.
I did not only need to know the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, when I was able to become an efficient Witz narrative machine, while I was a star on television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 in New Faces
As his manager had the stage right of the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment programme, in which the people of ``black anmold, ''led Henry his comedy for more than five years.
My family was very uncomfortable with that.
I wish somehow that it would never happen, but I do not regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this ``long award-winning light pillar of British television ''was also a`` grotesque parody of black people.''
By introducing figures that celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the 80s on an alternative Comedykreis.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went to the programme in 1984, and in the 1990s he was among others as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie Chef!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles were next in the next decade, but after its BBC-series, LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: ``What do you think everything feels as if you only get the time of time or come up with it? ''
Then there was a documentary series for Radio 4, which is the title of What is Great About?
The first consequence was Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was totally allergic.
I had never learned anything about him in school and was mostly in favour of a domain of the middle class, White in Struvaccinated and a coal head forward.
So I was very afraid of it.
All who interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said ``You should try it.
Do not make it bad if you do not know what you are trying to do.
Take a couple of words in your mouth and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare.
Henry made 20 lines out of Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I had the feeling that I was able to do so.
It was almost as if someone had finally put the head on my head.
``Therefore, it is a serious matter, take it seriously, you will get your text, researched a bit.
The samples were brutal and I read it for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that simply did not happen.
And soon he joined the comedy of the madness.
Suddenly I was in the national theatre and I could not believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, ``Oh, you changed you. ''
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to maintain the audience.
``A small voice told me,`` You now have to bridge 10 minutes while repairing the computer. ''
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea would go as soon as the problem had been solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said ``Oh, thank God. ''
I am not responsible for that.
I can leave that to someone else.
``You play in a play, so stay in your role. ''
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the eyes.
That too came well, so it is like a big shield of the Gods that I say ``This is your determination. ''
He says this, of course, with a Thursday vote.
So I stand by it.
I really love that.
I love to be in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedy - our conversation is crossed by humorous eruptions, while he repeatedly mimics people.
I decided not to make a stand-alone comedy because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of stranger is somehow dangerous.
If you want to do so, you go to a wall.
I sometimes speak live in the Apollo when I want to do so, but in general I do not have much of it before.
I ask him if he will once again make a stand-alone comedy tour.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to make a start, a middle and the end of a journey - I do not think I want to abandon it again.
Is this the new incarnation here?
I think so.
I love to be an actor.
It is fun.
One always tells a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi River blocks streets in Yemen's capital.
In the conflict between Shia Huthi-Rebellen and the Yemeni government, the Huit called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi-followers had occupied the central streets of Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman of the Huthi-Party said ``Ansar Allah. ''
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni reports from a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online issue of the paper, Huthi-leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi was threatened with a further escalation of the conflict, and his demands should not be met.
The Shia Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni Yemen and are calling for the resignation of the government.
The population of Huthi has been occupied for less than two weeks by the Yemeni capital.
Around 30,000 rebels built protest camps on the large access to Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there is always a bloody struggle with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers civil servants to contain ``clerers
Kenya began to register all of the state officials in biometric terms in order to delete ``ghost workers ''out of government salaries.
Staff who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay, was a statement of government.
The government claims that thousands of people will still receive salaries after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service in his time in office.
During a check at the beginning of this year, it was agreed that at least $1 million -LRB- 700.000 £-RRB- per month was lost to payments for ``clerers ''and other abusive financial practices.
The government claims that salaries will continue to be paid out on accounts after a person died or left the public service reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All of the officials must now appear in the next two weeks of identification centres to ensure that their data on biometric registrations has been reported in government.
Anyone who did not do so without a credible apology from the pay list passed the communication.
``This approach will help rationalise the public service by determining the real number of officials, and also the pay list on both levels of government - the`` ghost workers ''are eliminated, ``said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary of the Department of decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal of the art consultant, Helge Achenbach, will first be held in court on 11 November.
Five of the heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi Gründers Theo Albrecht, are calling for compensation from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was shared by a lawyer on Monday.
In the rehearsals, Achenbach was cheering in the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and charged Berthold Albrecht for higher prices that were actually paid for sale.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach purchased 121 million euros of value for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
For 44 years he was in the school service, of which 23 was the head of school.
From that time, Manfred Richter knows many of Petershausener and Kollbacher of their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried out by his desire to see the people in the student.
The snow is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif of his homeland.
Judges was born in 1930 in Trautenau @/@ North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
After four years after four years of secondary school, he was interested in the teaching profession for the teacher.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After several months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946.
So he was a judge of judges to the Upper Franconia.
The training of teachers took place in Bamberg.
To do so, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometres for the next station ten kilometers per week, go by train to Bamberg, go three kilometres across the school and return to school in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a red cross home in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 participants in a sleeping room.
In 1951, after three years of apprenticeship, he made the second state examen after three years of apprenticeship.
When Oberfranken had no free apprenticeship for him, he was in charge of Upper Bavaria and came to school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The ``milling room ''was his first`` service apartment'' in the school house.
In 1958, he referred to the school as a 3-room apartment in addition to the school.
This House bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach and five classes in Petershausen-Kollbach and Petershausen.
From 1968 @/@ 69, they were brought together in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association was founded, only primary school remained in place.
In order to avoid a decline in the smaller school, Georg Sigl in Karlsruhe and Manfred Richter changed his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain today's construction since September 1982, which was extended to Judge retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the senior mayor Ludwig Götz, who additionally built a workshop room and the extension of the building in 1997, although it was not possible to benefit from the guidelines for school buildings.
``Mayor Götz was very indebted, ''he remembered that he was grateful.
In his whole career, Manfred Richter never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had replied to a school council on justice and justice: ``They must never forget love. ''
``You must give the children two things: Roots and wings, ''the 84-year-old says today.
And he has had to know: ``This does not always succeed. ''whether he means only his students or his own six children, it is not entirely clear.
In any case, Judge was sometimes unconventional.
When students were subjected to testing, they did not receive a penalty from him and were not even beaten up.
At the expense of the community, judges tried to create two pair of boxing gloves and let the two compete against each other.
For the benefit of the school, judges as Rektor had a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz -LRB- CSU -RRB-.
This moved the partisan judge after retirement, in 1996, at least as a last on the CSU list for the municipal council.
However, judges was elected in the course of six and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days.
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists take advantage of the spa park of Bad Salzhausen in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen.
When cyclists take their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots Rast, this is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of impressions was only made: The 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour enjoyed a break at the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open skies in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
Under the motto of ``cycling and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig, ''the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: The cyclists took the first stage, 60 km from Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of the mayor of Hans-Peter, who was in Bad Vilbel with the bicycle, were greeted with the head of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and soul, all sorts of good things were prepared for good things: The agricultural women from the city of Rankenstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple, kennel, stream and cheese cake.
``These cakes can only bake land women, ''praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while he stopped another piece.
Cold refreshments could be found at the drinks office of the gym.
The ``duo Bravo ''was one of the well known melodies of opera and musicals.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
What is more, it is true that it is one of the people who live in one of the children of the world.
Meanwhile, the mayor and the business manager had to work: They were interviewed at the fountain before the drinking shop of reporters Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to promote the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also since the first hr4-Radtour of 2004, since the first hr4-Radtour of 2004, since the first hr4-Radtour of 2004, it was possible to go out and do plenty of technology on site.
He also wrote three phones and a radio device with his staff and sent a radio device to the police of Hessen, writing Facebook entries and making reports.
``The majority of participants came from the Rhine-Main area, ''he told us,`` but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach to the Taunus and even from many cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends on the accommodation capacity that is available.
In category I place the participants in hotels in category II in collection.
From the health resort, the cyclists had a good impression when they came back after a year and a half: ``Chüss! ''
``It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!`` They came to leave.
After the arrival in Scots the group was able to take a short break.
But in the evening the bikers were required to take part in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Association for Tourism and the City Marketing -LRB- GTS -RRB-, the park had a beautiful festive atmosphere and of course it was prepared to prepare a lot of food.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS-CEO Markus Hoßfeld, and MSC-Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sdge in his function as a member of the board of the ADAC Hessen-Thuringia welcomed the visitors.
The Three were clearly pleased to hear the ``multitude of operations in Scots. ''
DJ Tobias Hagen then left the dance stage.
The opportunity for the fun of riding under the open air has been eagerly used in spite of the sporting activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests, there were growing numbers of people who were as enthusiastic as the great spirits of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations of Birstein, Guarditersbach and Bad Orb were on the programme for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 km of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers due to ``conspiracy ''against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey as a result of the suspicion of the ``conspiracy against the government. ''
The police forces did not make a direct comment.
Among those who were arrested there are 14 senior police officers, who reports that he reports that the Daily News is available.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police were arrested because they were supposed to set up a organised criminal organisation and call telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -LRB- who was then Prime Minister at the time -RRB- described her as part of the activities that are led by the Islamist clerics of the period of life and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost across Ukraine opened on Monday -LRB- 1 September -RRB- after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazeera brought his daughter to school.
There, he told prisoners that not all schools had reopened but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in any school.
The sky is not peaceful throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, which is a huge, democratically elected seat of Ukraine, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slawjansk, talked about Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here and that children will receive an education that will be useful for them.
The first school year of the new school year will traditionally be celebrated, and the children wear embroidered shirts, hold ballons in the hands and give flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets a proud retirement age from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tor Party.
And it has its own frontal experience.
Her career began with the global management advisory company, Bain and Co., which changed it to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top post of the mother company Pearsons went to a young male colleague.
Nearly 1 million of them were killed.
Their political ranking is also sound.
It was recommended by Lord Browne, David Cameron of Lord Browne, to the former chairman of BP when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: She became a consultant in the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Even in May, I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned Kelch.
Not only is the BBC as a vast and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: Following on from the first guard of its own identity hierarchy in the BBC, but also on the outside as a voice of public concern and anxiety, when things go wrong.
This gives rise to an almost unsustainable dual pole, which requires full reform.
But, whoever would risk holding it would risk going to everything and dividing up an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while it may be his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that were not enough, many of them are still keen to see the BBC to see power, money, and status.
While the competition is approaching and new technologies threaten old and comfortable collateral, the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of EUR 145.50 per year, the British public buys the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: It says that it reaches 96 per cent of households and costs only 40 pence per day.
And apparently the BBC is back on the popularity scale: 53% support it today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The image and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I now get news on my mobile phone and later I see fit programs on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and considerable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found it.
Perry from Texas says that downdirected Tweet was not authorized to be authorized.
A Tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, included a downgrading remark about the democratic district prosecutor, which is at the heart of a criminal prosecution against him for abuses of power.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perl's user account.
A Tweet was sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
``I do not cheap the Tweet and have deleted it, ''he said in the later news.
Staff of Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perrys received official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavorable image of the municipal prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn in April 2013.
Perry put a veto on financial support of their offices when they refused to resign what led to an indictment of Perry - which may be a presidential candidate for 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweets is as follows: ``I'm not always drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level, but when I do it, I kiss Governor Perry when he fills it. ''
I am the most hated democracy in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the guidance of the study of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, selected by a Republican judge.
Perry is not guilty of guilt and he called the indictment a political trick.
His highly sophisticated team of lawyers requested in the case of the case and argued that the law that was directed against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is unclear in terms of defamation.
Perry stopped 7.5 million dollars of government money on the Public Integrity Unit of the State, based in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas, when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perl official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he completed the election assembly in Iowa in 2012 when he completed his presidency in 2012, Perry went into speculation that he was going to stop putting a Tweet of a photograph of himself in the vicinity of a lake, with the words ``South Carolina! ''
Berkeley explains the housing market again for ``normal ''
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England was once again at normal level.
Homes in the capital of the capital were hot in and subject to enormous price increases, which led the Bank of England because of widespread fear of a credit bubble to place ceilings on mortgage loans in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the highly classified construction company of Berkeley, said on Monday: ``Since the start of the current financial year, the market has again returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013, ''and also added that this is a`` stable act of action.''
The real estate market in London was well established during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Katowice Office, the prices in the area of the city rose by 18,5% alone in last year, far more than the average rise in England and Wales as a whole.
The average selling prices for private, affordable and student offers of private, affordable and student offers increased by about one fifth by the end of April by the 423.000 £.
But a stronger pound has made real estate property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been humiliated by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric by a possible ``Villance ''before the general election in May.
In last week of London, the London property broker warned that in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April would also lead to lower market growth in real estate sales as at prices.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the property market is cooled down.
Hamptions International, a other real estate agency, fixed its forecasts for the rise in housing prices in London in 2015 to 3%, on the basis of what is already now the weakening of the welfare of the skin.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now fallen year by year to a quarter, which is the broker of WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, because the fixed amounts for futures sales amount to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
In addition, Mr Pidgley added: ``The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best sites remained stable, and earnings sales remained stable.
In June, the company reported that it sold 3.742 new homes in the year until the end of April - nearly one third of the top of 2007 before the crisis.
The annual budget rose by 40 percent to €280 million, sales by 18 percent to $1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the Annual General Assembly of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year was expected to correspond to current market expectations.
According to analysts, the annual preliminary tax result has been paid out to 450 million.
On the afternoon in London, Berkeley shares stood at 23.96 £.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence released by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence will perform at the 85th Oscaror.
Naked photos of the Oscaran winner Jennifer Lawrence were released online by a hacker who claimed to have a ``master list ''of images of other 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star of ``The Tribute of Panem ''confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and hackers complained about`` blatant violation of privacy.''
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo album were allegedly received by a hole in Apple's online storage system, and the alleged ``master list ''of the hacker victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Wess and Mary-Kate Olsen, Buzzfeed.
It is not safe how many of images are real, even though Wish, Star of ``Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world ''also condemned the Hack on Twitter.
``On those of you who watch photos that my husband and I recorded years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so satisfied with you, ''wrote Written on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries `iCarly 'and` Vicinate' said, however, that when it comes to photos of images of her and tweetete, ``These so-called naked images of me are counterfeit, people.
Let's take a look at the beginning of the day.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a pop star Ariana Grande reported the authenticity of the supposed photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons of highly praised new novel about love and the letter ``J. ''
They began to melt, so they could best describe it, they could slowly end up like a cardboard that has been left in the rain.
Occasionally he said to him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, slow, and perhaps somewhat scratchy.
And let him shake his hand.
He knew what he had to do.
He was in stone, as was in Igel, yea.
The last victim of this barrage was a just starting affair, which was more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life, perhaps bringing him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a treacherous beauty with untold hair and a flushing heart of a village on the North Island.
She came to the south with an older accompaniment that Kevern held for her aunt, and the plot of land was inherited in a wet but heavenly valley with the true name of Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the House.
The tubes were leck, in the baths were still spins, neck necks had left their tracks on all windows and they believed that they were all of them, and the garden was supervised with weeds that looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house out of a playground of children, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel ``J ''stands on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern was one of the first to be one of the best known friends of the year.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was banned correctly - simply was not played.
It has been successfully outdated, as the word turns out to be obsolete.
The general taste of what would never have been achieved and what rules would never have achieved, and like the people of books choose to select the Vom-Teller of more luxurious memoirs, cookery books and love romans, which is why they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to take great feet in a grob-comic Serenade.
Ailinn did not understand that.
``This was a famous song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller,`` he explained it and he automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That had always done his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It began as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father played it with his own father, so he was told.
If you place a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a Penny.
It has not been a very funny game at that time, and it has not been very funny now.
He knew that he was expected to do so; it was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never had to be one of them.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly banned.
Improvising was no longer modern.
It was only place for a single in life.
People wanted to be at the beginning of a melody where they would end.
Also the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically pressed.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew anything about jazz from the half-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he did not have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of group talents, as was that of fate.
People with afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent, as from the nature of electronic talent, were blessed and were in charge of the task to ensure that no family remained without a working phone.
What had still been left of the Polish community was taken into account; what was left of the Greeks was crushed plates.
Those from the Gulf and the Levante, whose grandparents not quickly left the country, took WAR out of fear to be accused of being accused of fire; for fear, that the flames were supposed to eat them as next, were in favour of and were in favour of inaction.
Each according to his abilities.
As they only heard ballads, Ailinn was hard to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could ever become more expensive.
Music was the expression of love.
``They are not really insulting, ''Kevern said.
Not for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
He was too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the enormous carbon leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father love to love that?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in her present.
She already thought that he was somewhat curious.
``It appeared to him,`` he said instead.
She shook her head and left his head.
Around the world, there was nothing else to see, as it was unconnected.
There was nothing that he would otherwise have seen.
``If you say it,`` my without conviction.
But that does not explain why you think of it.
It seemed to be honest.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet do not do so right.
Perhaps your ankle, a small bit of money.
And you say you hate me because my ankle is too thick?
You hate?
Of course I do not hate you.
That is just the wrong song.
He could have said ``I love you, but for that it was too early.
``Your thick ankle is precisely why you get me, ''he tried to do it instead.
I am a bit disappointed.
That was not true.
It had to be funny.
When he was trying to be funny, he was often in trouble because, like his father, he did not have the calming charm that was needed to tface the cruelty of jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be Kevern, who was.
In spite of its friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was red and rose from her deck chair, the console threw out and the wine was drunk.
It was not an apology for him, in other words that it was a wine of wood.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like Palmwel in the storm.
``And your thick head is precisely the reason why I feel moved to you,`` said them
Except that I am not one of them.
It was sorry for him, both for the unnecessary disfriendliness of his words and for the fear that emerged in her eyes when she was opposed to him.
Did she think he would beat them?
She did not tell him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was essentially here.
The same huge and icy ocean collapsed there as on the shore.
The same confusing men, with even thicker skin and more elastic after the, WAR did so when it was their ancestors who were as smugglers and beach robbers; always moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who denied them or taken care of them.
The head of gravity?
They would have shown a thick fist if they did not stand up!
They were only able to crack - the most used word was for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter-gift to the nonsense of love ballets out of the console - they only beat and beat them.
According to Keyhound, this was an unnecessary refinement, because it was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign of his body.
He grew out of a deck chair like an old man.
She also felt stable, but the fate of his sorrow surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew about it.
She looked at him how he was distant - as seen by a room on the upper floor - a man who complained by something that he himself was calling for.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, even though some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned from her to prevent his back, his back was ashamed to defeat, without fighting spirit - why was it a sight that she seemed to know well if she was not able to remember a single one that she had previously seen before today?
When she was alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
For a number of years before the events that have just been mentioned, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnov, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, was working on a short presentation of the continuing violence at low and medium levels in precisely the way in which their reduction, if not abolition, had best been expected to be best expected in the face of
``much has already been done, and much has to be done,`` it has already been done, ''she wrote, ``she wrote, to denote the innate aggressiveness of a people that has led a thousand wars, and to have most of it, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness historically has rarely been felt by
But some of the properties turn out to be intractable.
The higher the church tower, the lower the passion that he continues to awaken.
The people of France who believe that marriage is one of the people who are in favour of marriage and family life, believe that it is not only the old raw materials that rural communities as well as our urban structures do in their hands, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and abandoned dispute at home, work, road and playing fields.
``You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate, ''she said that her mentor had read the whole report.
I suggest that you read fewer novels.
ESME Nussbaum cut its head.
I must also ask: Are you Atheist?
``I do not think I must say, ''ESME Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Again, ESME stopped her right to privacy, refusing the statement.
Feminists?
Again, silence.
``I do not question that,`` said Luther Rabinowitz finally, ``because I would be against atheism, lesbian or feminism.
This is a free job here.
We serve a society that is unbiased.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can occasionally distort the results you presented.
You yourself seem to have prejudices against the church, and these things, which you call to be ``silent, ''and`` roh,'' could also be interpreted by others as an expression of a sense of strength and vitality.
If you continue to go on what is going to be done, what happens is that if it were to happen if it was going to happen yesterday, it will mean taking the country into account.
ESME Nussbaum looked at itself while Rabinowitz mentioned.
Behind his head a LED font in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter-century or longer.
Smile your neighbors, add value to your partner, listen to your friends, listen to ballads, visit Musicals, use your phone, talk to you, tell you, tell you, vote to vote, vote to vote, excuse you.
Talk is better than silence, the spoken word is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
``I absolutely understand what you want to do, ''`` replied to ESME Nussbaum with a calm voice when she was sure it had spoken to end, ``and I say nothing else because we are not yet as effective as we are deluding ourselves.
My concern lies in the fact that, without prior warning, we may well find out how we repeat the mistakes that were only done at the time of the.
This time, however, it is not the others in which we leave our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed with the hands of a pyramid.
So that you can see some of them.
``You go too far, ''he said,`` If you call actions as a mistake that perhaps or even did not commit our grandparents.
They also go too far when you say that they would have missed their ``anger ''and`` distrust'' to ``others. ''
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past, as with the protection of the present, we do not speak `us' and` others'.
There was no and there was no `other '.
It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.
``If we are honest with ourselves,`` Let ESME throw, ``no part of the company can claim to behave well.
I am not afraid of anyone.
Whether or not it has been done, what has happened, has been done.
That was at the time.
Nothing else has to be said - we agree on that.
And just as no blame must be given, it is not necessary to blame it, if such deflation would be adequate and if there was a way to do it.
But what is the purpose of the past if we do not learn from it.
The past is that we forget it.
If I may say something about this -
Luther Rabinowitz abandoned his pyramid.
``I will remember her report,`` he said and he did.
On the next day, when they went to work as usual, she was passed by a motorcycle driver who, like passers-by, was on the foot of the foot in a kind of ``brutal rage. ''
There is one thing that exists.
Lesotho-military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Official officials of the military in Lesotho began to have a coup to overthrow the government, and they said that they were opposed to policemen who are accused of the armed forces of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and told him that the army of the country transformed his home residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of the capital.
The Premier brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after he reported threats to attacks.
Military spokesman Major Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup, but the military responded to the threat of ``political fanatics ''whose armed forces were facing the police.
``What was done this morning was that after he received several secret services in the police after he had received several intelligence reports, some elements in the police that actually wanted to kill some of the political and partisan young fanatics who soon had to arm themselves against devastating damage, said he said against Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman, Clayson Monyela, said that military action has made the impression of a crash.
``Although no one has claimed that the government has been torn by violence, all the reports agree that the activities of the defence forces of Lesotho have so far shown signs of a coup d'état, ''`` said.
Speakers of the military of Lesotho said on Sunday that the soldiers returned to their barracks and were silent about the situation in the capital.
In the meantime, the Deputy Deputy Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the governance of Thabanes.
Thabane told us that he believes that he has become the target of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
Since June, there have been high tensions in Lesotho after Thabane parliamentary meetings began owing to the disputes in its unity government.
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government, despite the contrary accusations.
Production in the Eurozone on a 13-month period
The increase in production in the euro area slowed in August to the lowest point of the last 13 months, with a study that has just been observed.
The final market purchasing index of the manufacturing company -LRB- PMI -RRB- fell in August to 50.7, after a booth of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 gives an expansion.
New orders went back and factories began to experience growth in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia on Ukraine.
The figures take place before the meeting of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to set up a clear plan to deal with the eurozone's hesitation and to prevent deflation from only 0.3% of inflation.
There are speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could give more details in the course of this week whether it would consider a quantitative easing for the euro area in line with those carried out by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
``Although a little growth is better than no growth, the slowdown in the rise of economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers has become clearer,`` said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The Fabrik-PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, was at the lowest level in 11 months of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46,9.
France remains a custody child, as well as the descent of Italy of a solid expansion of stagnation.
Evidence of the fact that growth incentives in key industrial mechanics in Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands no longer work are also not reassuring, ``said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is probably fueling the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57,3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global, said: ``The best that can be said for the procurement index of manufacturing in the eurozone in August is that the sector continues to grow. ''
He also added: ``At the moment, producers in the euro area obviously find life quite difficult, as the increased geopolitical tensions, especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine, increase uncertainty in the increasingly difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties clearly affect the economy, in particular and consumer confidence, and is likely to delay or even cancel some of the orders, especially large contracts.
He said that it is going to be `always more likely 'that the ECB must finally initiate a type of QE, even though we suspect that this will be limited. ''
Since the terrible siege of the school, ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people from Chechen militias were taken hostage in a school in Beslan in Southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped from the death of Greueltat in the classroom.
Exactly one decade after the appalling siege of the school of Beslan, with 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the start of a new school year, this seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then surprisingly transformed into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell is going to be pursued forever.
Your biggest hope?
It is now an end to the war that is now dying in Ukraine.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb back into the crumbling school sport hall.
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Settakov and known when she only tried to climb back into the crushed school hall after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother, Larissa, for 40 years.
Both were dead, but they survived.
``A woman told me that I should race for my life, but I could not say`` said Aida then.
My legs were old.
I stood up and climbed again to search for my mother.
A soldier brought them into security.
After a series of operations, she was completely cured, but yesterday said: ``three months ago the pain returned.
I fear that I must take action again.
Some grenades are still in my knees.
Your target is to become a dentist to help people, as helped by doctors.
``This tragedy changed my life, but it has not broken me, ''she says.
``This is what happens to me, and we can not change that
Once again, I always go to the sports hall to remind me of those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too high.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamt to go to school.
``I do not want to marry until I start my studies and my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege is always going to be part of it, although the memory of each year will become somewhat weak.
I am glad that many people around the world are still reminding us of our horrors, and we are so grateful for the aid we have received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me, as I back back into school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and help to do something that does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball shark, in the opinion, his mother was dead.
It was his first school day -LRB- Russians go to school for 7 years -RRB- and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said: ``Mama told me, I should show myself when there was an explosion and to keep their hands. ''
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: `.
Full of fear, he could be dead, fled him and saw on the way of a wine of small child, seized it in the hand and fled by a ballar.
His father, Vladimir, who closed his son outside, said: ``Damir told me that his mother died.
He said: ``I could not save them. ''
In fact, Tamara was out of the hospital and he was in hospital; in turn to believe that her son had died.
After reunification, she said, ``I was delighted to hear.
I could not believe it.
He burned and surrounded me.
Damir was later flown to London -LRB- from what was now released News of the World -RRB- to get the title of a Barnardo's of Children's Champion by the then Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
``This horror follows thee every day, but I wish, I could stop remembering, ''he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will shine in my memory.
I still know that immediately afterwards I threw all my toy guns away.
But now I can play computer games with guns, which is not a problem for me.
``I am not afraid to go back into the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember those children whom I played in the courtyard and who did not manage to go outside.
We never say that they were killed or dead.
We say that they remained in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially in the toys shop, where I was able to choose everything I wanted and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered.
This horror follows thee every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me.
``I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors,`` said Damir, who worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I would like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and I hope that they will take me next year at the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: ``37 children from our neighbourhood were killed, you can imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who were able to call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London did when I told our story.
At that time, I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and simply say that 10 years has passed, but I still remember the meeting of her and her husband in London, as did the Damir and myself.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat boredom and how she called all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played in a restaurant with waiters; Damir shot with his water gun on them and ran them and played with him.
And that was only one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British shared our pain and supported us.
She said, ``I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war now goes on, and every day kills people, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are such children as ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or work with something else.
I simply know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can not fail to feel that
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir was large and is a very gentle and peaceful boy, he is not even aggressive or angry.
He, for example, is not looking for revenge; he is not overwhelmed by the last horrors.
I know he is not keen to remember that, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go into the sports hall and the candles.
When he was small, he suffered - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa, which turned the face from us, for hours.
Failing to sleep, his eyes were open.
I still remember how he continued to beat all his weapons and other military toys; Damir is now 17, bigger than I was, benign, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was a few hours long that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked at me and saw hell around me around me, with the body parts that lie everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my small boy in this hell was unable to survive.
``I remember that I stopped him,`` Damir, Run, Run away, ''but I was also sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he has gone away.
And so, unlike many others, life goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The Young, whose terrible image became the symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan-overseas Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, on the right of an image of Georgij today.
His bloodless face was drawn by fear when he burned his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had taken him off for his first school day before she was moved to bring her older son Wladimir to university.
``I left the farm for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed, and so my small boy stayed for three terrible days alone,`` she remembers.
Not only was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the more it is to think about it and to talk about it.
There is no single day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it was long ago, I think it was going to happen yesterday, some scenes from these days are forever following me.
Nobody will ever forget that, I promise you.
Insistent: The image of Georgij -LRB- left -RRB- was one of the most shocking of the attack and was dismissed as a statue -LRB- right -RRB-.
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school this day.
I only knew that he was in life when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the wine-growing Georgian in San Marino.
Georgij does not want to see the image, and it is hidden among us at home in the bookregal.
I understand that, but I also believe that, thanks to this image, the people of all over the world feel our pain.
Georgias says today: ``It is important that this can never happen again.
``I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People repeatedly investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they investigate the crash of these Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something of some horror.
``I can not understand how it is possible
Ten years is nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget a small.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmare because of the siege, but then it was better.
I later went to school in 2004 and I was afraid of fear.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That is why I always go to the sports hall when 1 September is approaching.
I wish to pay tribute to my old child.
It is hard for me to go into the sports hall, but I must do it.
I do not feel like a sacrifice, this story is now part of my past.
I am not going to forget it, but I do not accept myself.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I will become the heart of heart.
My first election was a training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not leave that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgij Faniev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgians Faniev was trapped during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached on the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is really a miracle that he has not been killed.
``We feel it would have been yesterday,`` Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, was unable to do so because of his health damage.
It is still with me, it is nothing I left behind me.
I am older and people say that children can easily deal with terrible experiences - I must say that it is not true.
``In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt something better, but I can not forget it
And I would like to forget.
In 2005, in the year, it was the first and only time that I went back into the sports hall.
I lost the consciousness.
I will never return there and do not ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Overlive: Georgij Faniev today, with a photograph of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is incredible and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do not like to think about it or speak about it and they never asked me for school.
I think it is a good thing to do.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can now do well.
But because of my health, I was unable to study at the secret hospital of the FSB in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I also sent my documents and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have already had two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals from cats to cows.
He said, ``I knew that I would never tell my children of my experience.
Children should not know anything and they should not suffer them.
His mother Marina, 42, said: ``This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary is approaching.
I shall go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know that Georgij is not going to go.
It must be much more intense for him because he was there and I do not need to.
I waited home for him and could not help.
I am grateful to God for being returned to me; here in Beslan all of them were drawn.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that when something happens to be unfair.
He is a boy, he may be sport, but he can not attend to his knee
It has been operated on several occasions, it can run, but it is not going to do any sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but we can never completely overcome and forget that.
This terrible experience is always going to be pursued by us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege and that only increases my pain.
I lost many people whom I knew well and which were expensive for me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God was able to make me do, but my heart is crying out.
I know of families in which new children were born.
It is hard to accept that life continues, even if we do not want to do so.
I never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe that.
We were previously a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine, and many are being killed.
If all of these rebels were able to take action - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskevwa, 10
The baby, which was so done by a special intervention command was carried out in security.
Saved: Aljona Tskevwa is released by a Russian special intervention command -LRB- left -RRB-.
She is now ten -LRB- right -RRB- and does not even remember the atrocities.
In 2004, the world felt that the baby Aljona was born in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty they stopped their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister of Kristina and their brother Makhar in the school sport hall.
Makhar, at that time, was three years old, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Since then, her father, Ruslan, has since married and has a little girl with his new wife a little girl that he named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, ten years of age, does not remember the siege and has grown up to an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors.
``They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children,`` say a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that grow with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused girls of crossing the pedestrian pass in Fife.
A 78-year-old man is in court because of the slaughter of a three-year girl.
Gordon Steward is accused of having a girl on the transition to the transition to the transition in East Neuk.

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you are interested in making photos or videos under water, there is a choice of devices.
The most economical option is a water density Point And-Shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action-Cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are about 300.
I recorded these photos with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment there are some rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure that the battery is close to the battery.
Also place your camera on the photos or videos you want to take.
There are a number of cameras and cameras that are equipped with scenes and recording styles.
And before you jump, check the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Browse through our shopping guides and the ratings for digital cameras for conventional and watertight models.
Make multiple recordings because many will not fail.
Point board cameras have a LCD with which you can compose images, Action-Cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to look at it under water, and the correct image setting is a cause of happiness.
So do you a lot of pictures.
If your camera has a friction mode that makes a series of images with slightly modified exposure settings, use it.
Remain close to the surface.
The light is dramatically worse, depending on how you move away from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to bring more color into your photos; the lower you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good Council on land, but it is all the more important because of the poor light conditions.
It is especially important when you work with an Action-Cam: These devices often have a solid wide-angle lens, which means that you need to work with your objects if they are to fill the whole image.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes, even in such a giant organization as NHS.
As an advisory anaesthesia, he devoted his career to saving patients with the agony of the disease as well as the quorum of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife, his wife was a MI6-employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important to diagnoses and diseases, while the surgery mainly deals with something quite different: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the man whose suffering began.
``I did not feel, ''he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulty, I'm trying to clean.
While he fought with the gripsy symptoms, he noted that he was impatiently accused of his wife Juliet.
``I want to do everything as soon as possible, ''he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt that he felt that he did not feel any cause for concern.
Anything was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he was in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray inspection was present.
He was suffering from Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest of breast.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is mostly difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers are sick of lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients were previously smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all of the cases, the trigger is an attack on the fibre construction material, which was once deemed to have been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can easily ignore.
Finally, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos was no longer used in Britain since the 1960 ''s when industry voluntarily pledged not to use it.
There, too, where it was still used, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric of plumbing, construction workers, houseworkers and advertisers.
As an industrial hazardous material from another time, it does not seem to be a cause for concern today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is the culmination of an epidemic of mesh.
There are more deaths from Mesotheliom than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.
Annual figures of the Mesotheliomtodescases since 1980 and expected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are seeing the deadly effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years -LRB- in 1999 -RRB- is that a Mesotheliom has only developed after decades.
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not confined to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still living in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And so, Mesotheliom knows no class barriers, financial limitations, jobs or old age.
The privileged bases, ranging from elegant shops in London to private schools, are not a protected area.
The buildings of Parliament are contaminated with asbestos.
In the hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy, these deadly carcinogens have already been identified.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a plumber.
In fact, it was difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it.
``It looks like in the tunnels of Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos. ''
All of the students, nurses, doctors and Pförtner are using the tunnels.
One wonders how many old people will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
``From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and in the last five years of Mesotheliom, ''he wrote in a letter in 2010,`` I am the last one who still lives.''
How many more are we going to do?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February, he was 5.
It was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty per cent of all Mesothes died in 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore only repeat the question of Lawson: `How many are we going to do? '
The world's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the Indonesian epidemic is expected to come to a halt in the United Kingdom, more than 90 000 of the disease will be lost.
Most of them currently do not know that they will die.
An asthma mine in Quebec, Canada
A quick look at the files of the courts that often refer to claims for compensation shows the extent to which the scourge of the Mesothelioms is already spreading.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, were exposed to asbestos by Janice Allen.
She worked nine years for the chain from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship stores in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she began to work at M & S
Now she has two children in the kennel.
``Before this matter,`` she says, ``I never heard of Mesotheliom, I did not really know anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought that I would be concerned.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the concept of asbestos does not relate to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name stems from the word called ``Asstitse, ''a description of the fibre structure, which makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, which is also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common of asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof boards, floorboards, pipe insulations, ground isolation and even for brake coverings in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is considered to be the ``big health risk ''of the EU and the WTO.
What is more dangerous is the brown asbestos -LRB- Amosit -RRB- and the blue asbestos -LRB- Krokydolith -RRB-.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that ``it was clear, however, that this was a main reason for the uniquely high rate of mesh. ''
A staff of Marks & Spencer was exposed to the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, asbestos.
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical Mesothas victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their history is by no means uncommon.
He has presented a study of those who are affected, saying that ``a significant share of the Mesotheliomas, without known suspension by work or at home, has probably been caused by asbestos contact in the environment. ''
Most of these contacts are based on the ``normal use and ageing ''of our buildings.
It looks like nobody can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been vulnerable to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the services of the service were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres were able to be swallowed up by something as harmless as ``strong air movements ''.
MEPs are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Management Board of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the West Minster Palace had received a `clean health certificate ', it is now clear that 1 billion more than one year has to be increased over several years in order to renovate Parliament, to modernise electric installations and to remove the asbestos, and after the general election in 2015, MEPs will probably be able to meet at the nearby QE2 conference centre than on
The Godplay report also pointed out that ``the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective rules. ''
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
All we can do is to do so.
A person who was never able to determine the contact with asbestos was Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
``I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided, ''he says, but I can not prove in my case
It is so difficult to remember all the places in which work has been done and data is available.
What is still very reminiscent is the date of the beginning of December 2009, in which he received such a fever.
He was 45, and carried out surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly I had to burn frost.
It suddenly came to pass.
I felt terrible.
I believed that the journey to the House was no longer to be created.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest of breast.
But like Janice Allen he had no reason to suspect a Mesotheliom.
He did not work a month on work.
Doctors made X-ray recordings of his breast and put Pleurakathether to detect liquid from the lungs and to test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his job.
However, from time to time, symptoms returned back, often after sports and serious breathing.
In 2011, a patient came with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesotheliom.
But also now Abbott did not manage this with his own case.
After all, his patient was older and worked directly with asbestos.
The link in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbotts deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT-Sscans and X-ray images to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the reef and the chest.
I am an optimist.
I mostly do it simply, ''he says.
Frankly, I did not have so many concerns.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: ``It was said to me that it was Mesotheliom. ''
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly Abbott had dates with Macmillan-nurses, one of whom recommended to take a lawyer.
Only now is it the concept of the scale of the epidemic.
``It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings, where pipes were often isolated with asbestos. ''
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering.
And so Mesotheliom meets young people who did not work in the traditional professions.
The most dangerous tubes of plants in hospitals were under earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many people who ate in pedestrian streets from one building to another -LRB- such as Andrew Lawson -RRB- or in underground cantons -LRB- as Graham Abbott often did -RRB-, were most likely to be in contact with toxic substances.
It is clear that over several decades after the war, hospitals were likely to rescue patients for life, but to be life-threatening for the medical doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students put off their Bunsenburner on asynchronous mats.
And it does not just concern hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and urban halls.
Also schools.
In fact, many people had probably had the first instance of asbestos in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemical companies, students have shut down their Bunsenburner on asbestos mats.
On websites, the issue of asbestos in schools is often mentioned in schools.
And meanwhile, so many innocent items in our houses such as floors of floor contain asbestos by default.
``It is an industry that is included in large parts of our real estate,`` Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that was taken by a woman concerned was the demolition of a garrison in the 1970s.
So you can adjust how to remove your garden.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable is immense.
``It takes a while to process it,`` says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to go further, but I realized that I was not able to focus on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
The biggest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to a patient.
Like countless patients, he reminds him of the way in which he was overwhelmed by all the information he had to deal with.
``It was very difficult to record everything, ''he says.
``I asked my doctor, how long did I ask? ''
And there were about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, ``Then, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
That was `s then '.
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our life management mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most of the cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is swallowed up and the fibres are inhaled, it is possible to set itself up in the breast, the skin around the lungs.
Asynchronous fibres irritate the breast and can cause cell mutations.
``The problem arises with the ingredients that have been painted,`` for example, Professor Tom Treasure, a heart of the Thorax doctor. He changed to the guy's hospital in 2001.
Indeed, the hospital that suspects Andrew Lawson that it has exposed it to asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some of the others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital.
As soon as the asthma reaches the lung tissue, Treasure says that it is pressed by the respiratory tract to the edge, where the skin is.
It is from the very beginning of invasiv.
The usual options for other cancers do not work with Mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is extremely controversial.
Some believe that it is worth trying.
Treasure unites that.
``It is not possible to cut the chest, ''he says.
They do not come out of the knife.
Meanwhile, cancer is not very good for chemotherapy, but it can not be healed
``sometimes there are long-term survivors,`` says Treasure.
But at the end of the day, they are all dying.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott arrived in contact with Andrew Lawson, who after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and advisory office for those who were affected.
``hello, cancer central, ''he turned out to be happy with calls.
``He was very positive,`` says Abbott.
He had previously received his diagnosis for 4 years and was still very active.
Originally, there were six chemotherapy cycles, which last four months and are likely to only extend their lives by one month.
``I was desperate, ''he said.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson managed to let things appear in a rather more positive light. ''
After the advice of several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart of heart.
``We had an advantage that I did not need to be moved on, I simply called and got a date,`` gives Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and would have to wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is crucial to Mesotheliom sufferers in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments inevitably fail to fail, many face another financial concern - the future of the families that leave them.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
``It was known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health,`` says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s has changed to realize that a very small burden was a risk of health.
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually set their case, but it was not what Morgan calls ``full compensation '', because Lawson was not able to prove with absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, a spokesman of the guy confirmed that ``the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s. ''
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is an enormous problem for Mesotheliom patients who seek compensation, the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers were sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiff.
In response to this, there were clear new legislation in this year which makes it easier for those of Mesotheliom to claim compensation, even if their previous employers are no longer available.
The law has made a contact for all of the funds supported by the insurance industry for all diagnosed after July 2012, but was unable to sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiff receives 80% of what a court could have done in a normal compensation process - about 120,000.
About 300 successful applications in the program are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many of Mesotheliom, who was 350 million copies of a ``very good work ''of the insurance industry.
``This is a deal of insurers for insurers,`` he says, and it suggests that this figure is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if time had not been left over and it would be normal for the companies to find companies and would be normal.
Also, Mike Walding, the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Labour admitted that the law is not perfect.
But more rapid action in the face of seven deaths was necessary in the face of seven death victims.
``People suffer so much and now need help today,`` said to be sitting during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Law in December of last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first consultation, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expected a positive effect in contrast with Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-degree therapy that is able to present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt stronger.
``This is, of course, the most important thing,`` says Abbott.
This is something that is always seen in patients.
There is something to be done.
If you look at it, you will get worse off with you.
Graham Abbott moved to Operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he left the last of six chemotherapy cycles.
Subsequent scans did not show any signs of illness.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancers around my chest.
I was just going for 50.
That is not a question of life.
That is life.
Again, Abbott withdrew six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is more visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically demanding.
You must think of practical things - money if I no longer am, for example, or my wife shows how the boom time setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will get negative.
They must look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
``For parents that is difficult, ''he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not be old.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is a very sociable and unwieldy one.
She told her friends and we got very many calls soon.
Ellie was more cautious.
She did not say much.
Such discussions are something that all the cancer patients must do.
But, for Mesotheliomongue, such talks are not of hope, not of a trail of hope for survival.
The disease -LRB- as finally set up for Stephen Jay Gould -RRB- is a lack of security.

China refuses to use Hong Kong to vote for government,
On Sunday, despite the increase in calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the election in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach was probably charged with the long awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists who plan planning and mobilization within less hours after calling out. And
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the communist leaders to reject all of them.
``This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry,`` said legal expert Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing promised.
It has lied to the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Labour Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be chaotic.
Since 1997, when Britain withdrew control of Hong Kong, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants of 2017 to elect the government seat.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership retains the process of being controlled by a narrow committee committee controlled by Beijing.
A new clause will also allow only candidates to be admitted with love of land and love to Hong Kong.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong have taken place for a number of years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, Occupy Central with Love and Peace, whose organizers threatened to lift the financial district, is behind the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within a few hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters in the rain gathered ahead of the government of Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement reached a new level of civilian disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make any closer information, which is why they seem to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers told the organizers that ``the occupation of the central district was only considered last resort, an action that should only take place if all of the options for dialogue have been exhausted and do not have any other choice.
We are sorry to say that all dialogue opportunities have now been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have prepared for the announcement of Beijing for a number of days, and on Sunday before the government building there were stricter security measures, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.
The transport of people from the mainland reinforces competition for products and services.
Moreover, the fear that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing increases.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central-Movement, as they threaten the business operation - the life of Hong Kong.
``The protests from which they speak could cause major economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long they continue to continue,`` said legal expert Regine Ip, which has long criticised the movement.
We do not want to worry that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media recently reported about the democratic activists in Hong Kong as part of Western powers controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the right of election in which 78,000 people attended more than one-fifth of the electorate in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of early school sessions in the United States is now being transferred to the universities, where they are offered private aircraft.
We are happy to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxurious travel service of Britain for students of today.
To achieve an especially impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport lists such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten, or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also admitted that the service had a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise need to make use of their habitats in a dangerous car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that there were no new bookings, because the service was only introduced, but it added that ``students would book the service in the coming weeks. ''
The company also informed us that in spite of the tuition fees of 9,000 £per year, there was a demand for a market for this offer.
Students today differ from students to 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF it is possible to do so.
However, the National Students Union was critical of the service.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education said: ``This offer seems totally separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month with their studies face a crisis of living costs, as the available funds available in the form of credit and scholarships do not keep with the much rising accounts for the easiest way of life before they can even think about spending thousands of pounds of pounds for as little a day as the arrival in the student residence.
Feminists criticize racial and police behavior after Ferguson.
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sages, ``hands high, did not shoot,`` while they were waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mon, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the bloggers Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussion of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
But, while tensions in the Middle West increased and respected throughout the country, Perez saw that white women received 100% of the responses of white women.
In comparison with the responses of black women, shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as ``thinking about Ferguson by a white woman, ''and`` feminism, does not only revolve around the oppression of women.''
But for Perez this meant an important change.
``I do not think that in feminism many people find people who speak about the white, and privileges speak of such a high class, ''`` they said.
People felt forced to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnically that they must express that.
For English professors of Coritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems that face black American women every day but which are not considered to be ``women ''of women in the cultural sphere.
``I can publish something about Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere,`` said Mitchell.
When I say something about how farms stand under siege in their own country, the silence is stony.
``How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space? ''she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, the breed, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues cleanly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor for women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
``between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were yellow and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman,`` said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynchkilling.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women on the point in which white fighters analysed the country in the late years of the 19th century analysed and established that the fight for the right to vote could only have been successful for each group: Women or black.
``They met the decision to stand up for the rights of women, and the right to vote for black should later come,`` said Hattery.
When you remember such things, it is clear why coloured women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to be organized against the lynx in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed nearly 40 years after the original request for aid from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - a mirror of time in which white feminists played with the problems with which black women have tackled their lives for generations.
``It would not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to teach a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception. ''Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation, who built their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive funds, now seek to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist, Gloria Steiner, went to Facebook on Facebook after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a definite article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.
``I hope that women who have another, but parallel, have an inherent risk of understanding one of the body, and opinions on race, which are clearly different from public surveys will indicate change. ''
Although Steiner for a more intersectional feminism is mentioned in racial and gender subjects, some of her commentaries on the racial issue in America are some of them.
Christina Sommer, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of the author of ``Who stole feminism? ''
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But, when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were painful reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that comes into line with mainstream feminism.
After the US border police took up nearly 63,000 unattended minors on the country's southwest border this year, the issue of the reform of immigration is also returning to the surface of the world.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilized women for the reform of immigration, said that for a reconsideration of the subject, as an essential woman, she must only publish the stories of immigrant women.
``They speak for themselves,`` said Mercado.
When the vast majority of labour visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
``These stories are found in the women's organisations,`` they said.

The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120.000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the hotel - one that also belonged to a pig that had his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig on the photo is the pet of the owner.
``The photo was wrongly published and it was now removed ''said a spokesman of the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the previous collection as a ``unique detached house with a bedroom. ''
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears to be promotional material.
The domestic sale provided interest in the social media for interest in some of the questions whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SWCity Harvey is home to a new millionaire in the direction of Lottowin.
A lottery player from Harvey is this month.
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth lasts, with a happy winner who receives nearly $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
For the second time in five years, a newspaper kiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot in the draw of the first division to 1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
The shop owner, Steve Forward, said that the profit for communication in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everybody is pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA-winners celebrated profits last month in the first division, an appropriate conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
In August last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont previously achieved the megaprofit of $7.5 million.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said that the profit would allow them to travel worldwide and to buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly 85 million.
Leonidas asked in the gladiator arena
It was not only the gladiators in Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Roman Day in the art park of Matsch.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday, to defy the rainbow and to stand up in the cold cold and delight in the historical spectacle.
There were a wide variety of photographs, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and its importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force of the gladiator of Amor Mortis, which used every rain break to demonstrate in the arena that was prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner ``Leonidas ''turned out to be a humorous and experienced presator and sent his men into the ring to become the heroic ally in various gladiators.
First of all, the ``Provocators ''were first in line with the left leg and the head on the right arm.
It was followed by the ``Essedarii ''with chest of chest, short legs and face and iron gladiator.
In particular, the appearance of the ``Retiro ''which joined the`` Secutor,'' and recently fought for the Wall was especially impressive.
As it was the swords of the swords of metal, the shields and the worm flocked through the arena that a fear and bange could be the health of gladiators.
However, it was one of the most impressive ``Summa Rudis, ''the muscular referee who always had an eye on the eye.
``We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and the culture of the Roman era can be seen, ''explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the Association of Friends of Roman Channel,'' the intention behind the show.
After two years of preparation, an ``Oppidum Roman ''for one day became an`` Oppidum Roman,'' a Roman town like Vice-Chairman of Claus.
After all, the Romans did not only bring war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and many of the buildings that we admire today.
Remains of these were also seen at the Roman day, for example, ``Aquino marble ''from the 11 meter high and 1400 meters of long Roman canal bridge, which once stood at Lüelberg.
The Frontex company once and now faced water and energy supplies, and now Petra Fricke knew that ``We prefer to benefit today from the knowledge of then. ''
This also confirms the degree of study by the engineers of the engineering team two from Rheinbach, with the measurement instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma, or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim represented sketches and models of the excavations of 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypodermis, the hot air that once restored the Roman villa.
It was also impressive to see the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Court of Constance at the Rhineland left the remains of a Roman villa in the industrial park of Nord in Rheinbach.
One found a new building of an economic building with a intestine for the drying of cereals.
The building was probably known as a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property that explained the archaeological site of Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass of glass, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the fall of the Germanen in the Roman Rhineland, which was supposed to be Morunser.
In addition to this, the children also worked with the Roman wind of wind, similar to today's mill game, or wrote how once the Roman students wrote their names of metal.
At the stand of the Roman thermen of Zülpich, the children were allowed to put up mosaics and at the stand of the glass museum of Rheinbach glass mosaic and at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Centre there was a heavy wheat mill made of stone to show the flour for a bread or a cereals.
With the original Roman tour drawn up by two cold blossoms, the visitors went through the theme park and came to the impressive state of the city.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be brought to the end of 2000, with the death of Emperor Augustus more than 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and historical associations as well as the watchdog association, the Association of the Association and the World of Upper Austria, you will remember thematic hikes, a lecture, cookery and guided tours of school classes and guided tours of the Roman history of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legion of his work will tell the man of wax, presenting plants as living thinkers from the Roman era and offering a funny lesson in the event of international understanding between a group of watchmen and the inhabitants of the Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme in the context of a project.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, often visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be seen again.
In the Wachtberger Town Hall, a small presentation to the Fund of the Bercumer Matronenza will be remembered in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic of Western Africa
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned and international companies go by distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rotates on the fields that leave mines, and the markets have been orphaned - the virus has made it difficult.
Some international companies already go by distance.
``The Ebola epidemic is not only medical crisis, but also an economic, ''shares the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit
``It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money, ''says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia clothing.
The market only wants to buy food or disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia was hardest hit by the virus; alone, the fever was more than 600 people.
Recently, the health authorities said that the disease was exposed to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, thousands of others.
Foreign companies are members of foreign companies.
As far as resource-rich countries are concerned, companies rely on their operations.
Foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel company prefer to pull their employees, and several international airlines are no longer able to fly the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also reacting: Only a few traders leave their homes to obtain aftersupply.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans in the fields of export are being eradicated.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is going to be close to food
``People are increasingly going to travel, ''says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables, will rather stay at home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: Food is scarce.
In the markets, supplies of basic foodstuffs such as rice are disappearing.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international firms, is facing an image store - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time; Philippe Hugon says from the French think tank Iris.
It is crucial how far the virus will spread and how long the virus will spread.
For investors, the impression can be created, ``that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and so to invest, ''warns Hugon.
The disease also burdens the hard-pressed state budgets of the Member States.
The disease also burdens the already strained state budgets of the countries concerned.
Moody's rating agency fears that their budgets are strong on high spending on the health system and in addition to the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million -LRB- EUR 45 million -RRB-.
The impact has already been felt in Nigeria, where only a few ethanol cases have so far been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has so far not been affected.
But elsewhere, many people already remain at home from fear of contagion.
Also reservations in hotels go back.
Protect Your 50th anniversary
From 12 to 14 September the patron of ``Tannenwald ''Berngau will celebrate its 50th anniversary of the year.

A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festivities with their Dirndln.
The chapel of the castle is the castle chapel of Berngau.
The patronage has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State.
The original name of ``Protengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau ''dates back to 1907, when the Association was founded on 21 March.
In 1937, the Nazi regime led the dissolution of the association.
Until 1964 there were 19 young men who were born on 30 April.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a champion of a difficult initial time, in which it was primarily a matter of finding a club and installing the shooting operation.
As early as in the fall of 1965 in 1965, the patron of the patron began to compete with two teams.
In the following years, sports, which have now been organized in seven teams, were established in all classes through to the 1st Gauenstein.
For the first time in 1980, Rudi Meier was able to reach the city of Heidelberg.
As the performance of the active guard has increased, the number of members has also been positively developed.
After the ``Leininger ''association was no longer sufficient to meet the demands of a modern protectorate, the executive board under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future residence in the cellar rooms of the new`` Landgasthof Härteis.''
After a working performance of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988, pastor gave the church blessing to the church's blessing on 8 May 1988.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaushoot, connected with the solemn funeral of the new protectorate in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the protectorate celebrated its 30-year anniversary of the year.
In 1995 a fan group was established.
Josef Fernzl was mentioned as a member of the European Parliament.
A major challenge for the ``Bon ''and for the association as a whole was the alignment of the Bavarian Böll meeting in 2005.
In a lot of hours of volunteer work, the members of the United States modernised the premises of the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought about the latest state of technology.
Eleven of the World of Warcraft
It is also possible to see the sports services of the Protective Association.
In total, eleven teams are currently taking part in the rounds of race: Six airten teams, an airgun crew, a sports gun of KK1, a youth and two AH teams.

Tony Stewart suffers accident in return to the race.
Tony Stewarts' return to the circuit ended half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went to the wall for the second time against the wall after his right to finish in round 172 and his evening ended.
Stewart drove his shaman car into the garage and left it without talking with journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that his 14-year-old team was disappointed, but now focus on the race for the upcoming weekend in Richmond, Virginia.

We go to Richmond and we hope that we can do it better.
Stewart went back on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to repair the right-hand side of his car.
``I entered a good result today with rather good hopes of a good result, and I added:`` It simply did not work. ''
Long after the second accident, Stewarts car was loaded and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an Aschenbahn race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in persecution.
He returned to his job, while an investigation into the tragic incident, which led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr, who took part in the driving track during a race came to face Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities informed us that the investigation into the cause of the accident will last at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken on whether Stewart has to count on charges.
The three-winner Champion was received with a great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start to 12, Stewart was back in the first 10 and was temporarily on space.
After a reboot in round, 122, bushs came to fall.
Cars with No 18 except control after the exit of curve 2 collided with Stewart, driving both cars against the wall.

Ukrainian Army has abandoned the airport of Luhansk
In the Ostukraine the prorussian fighters continue to be on the march.
After heavy fighting, in which Russian tanks were allegedly involved, the Ukrainian army has abandoned today, Monday, the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk.
The army also said that seven soldiers were killed in the last 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroenko had previously had the human consequences of the heavy rainfall of his army in the fight against the separatists, and announced changes in the Supreme Army of the Army without giving details.
Prorussic separatists shot plane from the end of the day.

NATO is not going to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia as a result of the planned operations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said on Monday in Brussels that NATO was in favour of the United Nations Summit on NATO in 1997.
But the NATO leader, however, accused Russia of ``a resounding of the deal. ''
``Today we must face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner, ''such as Rasmussen.
Documents and opinions from the Russian side show ``that they consider us as enemies. ''
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that it wants to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A ``Readiness Action Plan ''at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that`` we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is needed,'' Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow on new gas talks
According to official figures, Russia and Ukraine agreed to discuss new talks on the settlement of their gas strikes.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, the Russian Energy Minister, Alexander Nowak, said on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision by the European Union whether it would also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has no longer received fuel from Russia for weeks.
Finally, Mr Oettinger, the European Energy Commissioner for Energy, was able to communicate between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned, Russia could also suspend the gas supply for Europe.
Europe is referring to a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, with much of it flowing through Ukraine.
Merkel talks about the word of power: Toll is going to be ``clear ''.
Once again, the Chancellor clearly recognises this.
But it is not a licence for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the passenger car toll have increasingly stifled the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has discussed a right of power for the introduction of a passenger car toll after persistent opposition from its CDU.
``To make it quite clear: It is in the coalition treaty and it is going to come, ''the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU senior bodies in Berlin.
However, on a detailed model, Merkel did not set itself up for the moment.
Certain parameters were called ``certain parameters ''in the black and red government program.
The Federal Transport Minister of Alexander Dobrindt -LRB- CSU -RRB- has made a proposal and it is now going to continue working. ''
However, the NRW-CDU insists on their `no 'to a toll on all the streets.
Merkel, also Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble -LRB- CDU -RRB-, has constructively contributed to the debate on a draft law.
In addition to the topic, Dobrindt also talked about other ways of activating more private capital for investment in infrastructure, for example, in terms of broadband.
``It's nothing that is special, ''Schäuble left a`` mirror'' report on Sunday to give up his own concept to pay motorway investors with toll revenue after the election in 2017.
CSU-chief Horst Seehofer subsequently warned against developing toll concepts for the lead minister in the Cabinet.
The third party of this House has confirmed his objections.
``The coalition deal never went out of it,`` all of them went out of fashion and the federal lines said, ''said.
In that respect, it is an important signal that hake has now announced that it should again speak about the issue.
Resistance to the plans is also due to the CDUganda associations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
In the background, it is worrying that a toll affects small border traffic with neighbouring states.
Seehofer asked for the release of the toll from the ranks of the CDU coalition.
The Left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
``The Murks-toll is dead, ''said leader Bernd Riexinger of the`` New Lessback Zeitung'' -LRB- Monday -RRB-.
``With toll the minister fails, ''Dobrindt wants to introduce a duty of vignettes on all German roads to start 2016.
However, according to the association agreement, domestic car owners must not be burdened with additional charges.
Therefore, they are supposed to receive full compensation for the toll through the car tax.
However, the model must not penalise foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often wrongly diagnosed
A britin said that she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she was only a few years old after she was diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease -LRB- CMT -RRB- - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the back.
Charity CMT UK told us that misdiagnoses are a frequent problem with CMT people because they know little about this disease.
Some 23.000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motorized disorders such as muscle weakness, insecure gear and curling.
The disease is incurable and progressive, and this means that the symptoms are getting worse.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought that she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is more than 51 years old, said: ``As a child, I knew I could not do the same as the others.
I fell forever and all of it took me longer.
I could never go with the other children, it was driving and the school was often going to go and running to run.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations for the discharge of her Achilles and feet of her feet, she saw her as a hospital when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from IAs.
``I felt guilty because I was curious, so I did not tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to FA-Gesellschaft,`` she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and I was struck by terrible panic.
I thought that I would be with 18 in the wheelchair and would die with 25, and slowly all my abilities would lose.
I made that with me alone and I planned my own funeral.
She said that when it was 17, it became clear that its abilities had not declined as much as they had imagined and asked their doctor.
He was simply standing up, and hug me and said, ``My love, I do not think you have that, otherwise you will already be in the wheelchair. ''
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests the CMT was detected.
``When he explained what CMT was, I felt as if I was a winner, ''she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT free month to draw attention to this disease.
Since the closure of the former forces of force, D. Berni Diether has been working as fire workers since the closure of the former force of force.
For less than ten years, the former force of force in Münsingen has no longer been shot.
In spite of this, there are still millions of ammunition in the heart of the Biosphere Reserve of Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they must be seized on the ground.
One of them is the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the final sharp shot on the court of Münsingen, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation fell.
Since that time, the 6500 hectares of land are the core of the Biosphere Reserve of Swabian Alb, opened on 13 marked paths for hikers and cyclists.
Taxation of businessmen in the area of Washington increases with economic recovery
Recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
Public and local tax exemptions for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published study of last week, and firms in the area of Washington were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland, and Virginia together paid $27.6 billion to state-owned and local authorities in the financial year of 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the revenue of $26.6 billion in 2012.
The national and local tax burden of companies rose by 4.6% last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9% in the year, and it was the third year of growth in the period after several years of decline from 2009 to 2010.
Government taxes increased more than local taxes, 4.6 per cent, so that the study was carried out by the Ernst & Young Service Agency with the center of state taxation, a fiscal policy group.
More than half of the revenues of the District, 56 percent, came from corporate taxes, while 36 per cent of the income of Marylands came from companies.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, achieved the lowest tax revenues from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is based on recovery of companies ''property values, telling the researchers, which led to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years of growth rates of less than 1%.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it also appears to be meeting Washington.
Companies in District, Maryland, and Virginia together paid more than $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of a year of 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in property values is not so effective in the increase in government and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes amount to less than one-fifth by companies.
Companies in Virginia and DC pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
``In Maryland happens: A large part of real estate, especially in the tax area around DC, it is either either in the possession of the government or of non-profit organizations that pay no property taxes,`` said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
Liberia is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes to offer the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not be estimated solely on the recovery of the real estate market
Company revenues also seem to recover, so that is the data.
Companies in the region reported on income taxes in government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
1 billion in corporate income taxes, 1 billion in corporate income taxes, was one of the highest figure in the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase equally in all three places.
The exit rate in the district was equivalent to 4.3% of the national average, while the increase in the rise in the world was significantly higher, 4.6 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an above-average tax rate of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6% in all three areas of office, has far less corporate income taxes -LRB- in all three companies -RRB-.
The company's tax rate is at 8.25 percent and in the district at a relatively high rate of 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, less state-owned and local corporate taxes would be demanded.
In the study, the district was not investigated.
Despite its benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same sentence as Virginia has passed, and the sentence will fall to 5% next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets next year, this law could reduce the national income tax rate from the State to 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime, it appears to be better off in the area of Washington, so they therefore pay more public and local taxes, in other words the recent study.
Corporate taxes paid by small businessmen as personal income taxes - a transition structure that is organized by most of the small companies - in District, Maryland, and Virginia, last year rose by 20% to $2.4 billion, a much faster growth rate than corporate taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes throughout the country is probably going to last this year, with an increase in the general added tax revenue for the state and the local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period of the year.
Nevertheless, the area of Washington could lag behind when the government's spending cuts impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German beer for Guangzhou
Hopfen and Malz - also in China a popular combination.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner town in China is now looking for a brewery and is also hoping for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in the district of Guangzhou in Frankfurt is the urgent desire of officials in China.
``We would be very happy if a German brewery were to settle in our city, ''said the vice secretary of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week during the visit of a delegation in his city.
Time and again, China's ruling Communist Party came back in the process of calling on this issue of the twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also named in Germany, is one of the richest cities of China.
Thus, people also felt the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessische SPD-Chairman Thorsten SchählGümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he was going to attend the project in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
``For beer, it does not need much: Good water, grain, and joy of life, ''he added to lunch with the party upper in Guangzhou.
Mr. Li was already able to enjoy this joy; he was the host of the host.
After that, the function from Guangzhou came from Guangzhou, which was served as a red wine that was served as food.
The Chinese brand of Tsingara goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed in accordance with German purity.
More commerce
A second request from the Chinese host would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice President Li said.
The Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 it was deleted for economic reasons.
``It would be worth it again, ''the local public felt convinced.
``Trade between our two cities continues to grow. ''
At present, travellers would have to take the detour of Changsha in the province of Hunan.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for flight connections.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, gave priority to this desire to discuss it with the Social Democrats.
``This is a very good idea, ''replied Shepherd Gümbel - the Chinese Vice-Minister of Li Jinjun, an intimate expert of Germany.
Well-kept Partnership
The leutri leader of Guangzhou hopes that Frankfurt will be able to attend a partnership meeting next year.
Li was already on the Main, but he was not yet in this function.
He was only in office this year after his predecessor was promoted for charges of corruption.
Also the local party chef Wan Qinglian had to go.
The way in which the governments of Guangzhou are acting is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is enforced by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked in front of his party career for an American company, which is very unusual in China's Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was the top manager of Fujian, where the car VW built a large work.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers of Guangzhou is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example with a exchange of students.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South China metropolis of Pearl River is almost like the whole of Hessen, with its economic power.
In the coming year, it wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion.
The family of Joan Rivers ``expresses the thumb '.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her arrival in a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has now become hopeful that the 81-year-old Komicers will recover from their sickness.
Thank you for your continued love and support, ``said Melissa Rivers today in a statement.
We are pushing all the thumbs.
Her mother was released on Thursday after an emergency due to heart of heart at the Upper East Side, Yorkville endoscopy, into Mount Sinai hospital.
The doctors deliberately put them on and closely monitor until they are satisfied with their state of satisfaction, which is still described as ``serious. ''
The response came from many pages, including in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly dams and rising wages
In future, more stringent environmental standards apply to cars and dams that come into trade today.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new dust exchangers from 1 September receive a label on which the buyer can see central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, in the category of ``Euro 6 '', more stringent nitrogen oxide values apply.
In addition, there are more money to be paid for the authorities: They receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of EUR 10.25.
Amazon buys TStop for $1.04 billion.
Amazon just confirmed what information was reported on Monday morning: The online retailers - and video printers and a large number of other things - buying the video streaming service for $1.04 billion -LRB- 970 million USD -RRB-.
The announcement comes surprising, not because no one was expected to take it out, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, the sale of cash to the video service of Google for a cool billion was decided, and cooperation also appeared to be of course.
TPlug, which was founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it became a platform for players who wanted to release their bravourpieces in games called ``YouTube for live games ''.
The Twitter interface.
And ``let's play, ''a video genre in which Better -LRB- mostly older -RRB- play a painting of intelligence theatre are already very popular on YouTube.
It is precisely that YouTube is often named when you want to describe Tone, so the message that you want to buy YouTube TSave has recorded something bored, a textbook example of established technology that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery of why the deal with YouTube did not happen, because the company reported that it was ready to pay as much pay as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Scheiar, President of TSwitch: ``We decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us to get there faster. ''
Another secret is, to be honest, the incredible success of TStop.
For snobs like me who explain that they prefer to play sports than to do so, it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes that, instead of even seeing the control console, you can take the control panel.
It is one thing to look at a friend at 3: 00 in the morning, while it is easy to see for yourself by resident evil and something quite different, to see how he is shot 20 times in Call of Duty.
You could now just look at all of these games.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego games, so without your own control over the viewing perspective, it is a real recipe for headaches.
I admit that the rapid trials in which the Roger Banners of our electronics age complete all games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as it is not a game or virtuoso that is, his Twitter channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do sceptics like me already know?
TStop is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It is hard to imagine that TPlug is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video, which would simply have taken you away.
But TStop has something that any company would like to see: Thousands of young men who are being recruited as advertisers.
As the President of Tlosar said, Amazon and Tzero believe that both believe in the future of gaming, ''and the medium does not show any signs of contraction.
At the castle of Burgundy at the Castle of Burgundy there was a lot to be done.
The concept of the organisers was agreed.
Despite the intense rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music lovers came to visit the open-air festival of the castle garden.
At times, the admission had to be stopped.
``That was annoying, ''said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salads of light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name of Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is supposed to radiate the brightness of the day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes anyway from your own.
This was already on the early summer evening when the first visitors arrived at the Open Air.
A celebration for all generations were promised by the organizers.
And that is what they have done.
Around the farms on the Castle Gardens there were salads, but also guests from the closer and near surroundings.
They followed the first live performances, and cool drinks were enjoyed by foot.
And right through the generations.
While one of them was lying on the white sand on the beach bar, some of them moved to a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, made up of the offspring of the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the case of children, the volunteers literally had all the hands of the word to become the captain and bring imaginative creations into the little faces.
In addition to this, you will also be able to find out what you are trying to do.
Until the rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he settled on the visitors, especially families.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop this.
``More people were expected to be expected, ''said Ron Sem, who spoke of a`` success throughout the line.''
This is why a repeat of the great party is not close to the end of the year.
Although it is necessary to work on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear that on Sunday, the popular vote was taken.
As annoying, he said that in the meantime he was to be stopped.
Apparently, the security company was booked with too little power.
As a result, some who already paid were no longer on the site.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler spoke of about 1200 visitors, who were in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
He was one of the first to be one of them.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned Shishaxe lounges could not be built, because the tents were not able to be brought to balance because of a tyre pot.
``In the coming year they will be there, ''the organizer will be.
The premiere of the Amula-Open Airs was more than achieved by the number of visitors.
And what in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made a number of errors which need to be taken again for the first time, with the second edition which must be eliminated.
Also in the social network of Facebook, the organisers must be critical of critique.
``Unfortunately, but for twelve euros, one is no longer expected, ''Melanie Meier says on the event page.
``You have unfortunately taken a bit of it, ''Ele Zimmermann thinks at the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems as much as they are.
I think it is very good that some people are not just being stupid, but also trying to do something on their feet.
Beware: Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.
Now the organisers will have a year of time to remedy these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wax that has shrunk
That is not what is expected.
Rather, it is waiting for the component to be used in the distinctive structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the creation of the Space Observatory Tira is completely renewed.
With a diameter of 47.5 metres, the new radom will be slightly smaller than the old one.
But the size still remains world record.
The final step towards the completion of the new shell is the Kappl.
The upper part of the old shell is separated and taken with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new shell will be set up.
As soon as the weather is played, the action is to take place on stage at the beginning of this week.
Participating in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain as much as its icy water was cast above the head was that it injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge went painful.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had so much love with the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she was responsible for the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain created so much when its icy water was cast over the head to hurt the structure of its face structure.
``The water was so cold that I screwed, and while I am the fact, my jaw remained simple, ''she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is thrown out over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that did not go, the jaw was missing, and then I understood that something did not agree.
My mother and my sister saw this also, and I did so in front of laughter almost in my trousers, but I had to get into the emergency.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was brought in to hospital to return the jaw after participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the Burgundy clubs soon going to pull together?
Last but not least there were two of them between the two Wolfratshauser Burgundy.
Now we need to think about a possible level of cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former Chairman of the Wolfratshauser Castle, led the project in the French Guédelon project.
Only one year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the castle of Burgundy.
So far, the positions seemed to have been dealt with in the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and possible reconstruction.
The two camps are now moving: We should soon be holding talks on a common approach.
This is confirmed by the main offices of Torsten Sjöberg -LRB- Burgundy -RRB- and Herbert Piffl -LRB- Burgundy -RRB- on demand of our newspaper.
``I called Mr Piffl and proposed that we could put ourselves together, ''Sjöberg reported.
In his opinion, all of the members of both clubs would again be able to work together in the future.
That is how fast visible successes can be achieved.
During the summer of the year, the castle is at the heart of the castle.
Herbert Piffl, Chairman of the House of Burgundy, was delighted to hear about the call.
Since the death of Pakistan, he is standing in front of the castle.
A new chairman is to be found in a membership session in the middle of September.
At the moment, the club has about 40 members of its members.
``After the death of my friend, Richard Dimbath, we managed to rest the club out of respect first. ''`` This ``was necessary to think about how it could go forward.''
According to Piffl the new chair is to go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the members of the castle would also be able to make a current mood within their group.
There is still no candidate for the presidency, Piffl says.
``But I'm confident that someone will find himself. ''He himself does not want to stand because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman was supposed to be a cloud.
The Tölzer wanted to continue working on the project.
The different points of view of reconstruction will probably continue to exist in the near future.
He appreciates Dimbath as ``missionar, ''who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similarly advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
They are a tourist magnet through the high level of participation of the population, as well as by volunteers from all over the world.
Piffl: ``I too was sceptical about it.
But, over time, I was more likely to believe that it is wise to promote the project, ''which could create a ``single place'' for the Flösten City.
There is nothing here to do here.
The project would also be able to finance the project through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors.
``I personally do not just want to throw the idea of reconstruction on board personally; I hope that the Burgverein will perhaps have something to do in this matter.
Its aim of documenting history first is ``important and good. ''
After that, we could continue to see.
Clever ways of saving with Uni-Lehrbooks
As the cost of university books for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the Fast-Zweitsemestergraduate of Matt Schroeder oversaw a clever austerity concept.
He found a temporary system for books by students and offered nominal compensation to delay sales.
``My mathematics book normally costs $180, but I received it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks,`` said Schroeder, 19, which visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
There were about 120 of them.
The division told us that on average students spend more than 1,200 or more on textbooks and studies that would allow students to have different savings options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schrovers are increasingly the solution to the choice of students.
The rents of textbooks become more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much lower price.
Neebo Inc, which runs more than 250 university bookshops, said that the lease of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that, for example, a quarter of the books in the Columbus book shops was rented in the last spring, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of the textbooks are bought by the National Association of College stores in Campus-bookshops.
Here is the unique one for the best deals.
Buy online online
Some new books cost only one third of the price for which they are in the campus-book.
However, the ninth edition of ``almost $290 in the year of the year, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler of the year nearly 290 of the year, can only be obtained from the specialised apprentice dealer of Chegg.com for $239.99.
Need to Buy
If one of the notes of other or normal usage tracks is nothing to do, used books are a good option.
To do so is needed to have Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, final student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent 42 Cents on Amazon.com 42 Cents for a used edition of ``Strategic Media Decision: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether earlier spending is permitted.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenses may often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest output.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half .com of eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting out
The rental of textbooks is worth a sense of thought if you treat it reasonably well, thinking that you do not wish to keep it back.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could borrow for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the terms of the business you rent.
If you do not return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-Books instead of traditional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg, you can rent a ``of course ''for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Let us look at each other.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School recommends the ISBN number for the price of books, as it is possible to find the right course.
And before ordering an online order, you should check whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks in delivery and finally paid the full price in the collage book.
Why ``Guardians of the Galaxy ''
``The Expendables 3 ''by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of USD 90 million in US in the US, while`` Sin City: A Lady to Kill For ``only $12 million in his budget of $70 million.
The film ``Sex Tape ''designed by Cameron Diaz only played $14.6 million in the opening weekend, while children's films were also able to disappoint the revenue even in revenue.
An article of the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children's films the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the cause.
In 2014, Collin was ``the worst year for children's films, and described`` Dragon by light ''as described as ``functional'' fantasy.
However, in films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly was able to show the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic rating for every summer film, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th July 2013.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that it is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is now working on Disneys soon, said to Hollywood Readers: ``I think the times change. ''
We must accept that and not try to buy the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash performance of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently made revenues of $1.2 billion in output of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as in the past year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
During the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on the films of comics and predicting a ``core melting ''of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy could well contain a true core.
Owing to the expected potential cash awards, including Avengers, Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World are other representatives of the film industry:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in cash results recently as ``cyclical, ''and it said to Hollywood reporters:`` The next summer will be the biggest summer of the cinema at all, and no one will worry about business.''
When, a few years ago, the 2nd ping-pong district was deleted, it was a step in the right direction.
Now the German ping-pong band has taken part in the programme.
As a result, whoever has not risen has risen.
However, in the coming season, in the coming season, the most important team of gods avoided the decline, but only scored five hundred in the coming season.
It is a fourth class that remains in the regional league, despite its grandiose history.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Dutch League, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
In addition, there is also a new association of members of the company, which is one of the largest companies in the world.
For the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Association League, the Torpedo-Second in the National League.
What looks like a better county class is now the new district of the south.
Here, TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Booming SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC will take part.
In the district league, as regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of the TTC II, Rot-white, the Booming SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III, the members of the Board of Directors at least start in the direction of the rank.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
In the district league you run Torpedo III and Sattenhausen @/@ Wölldorf.
With the nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district of the SCW-boys - there is still Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Booming SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded Regional Association, the two diaries start with nine teams.
In the west season there is the Rot-white II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV, V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengbs II.
In the east season you will play among Sattenhausen @/@ Wöllgraben breaks, Nikolausberg and Landgolfshausen.
The Damen County League consists of Sattenhausen @/@ Wöllringen ausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in a circle of Easter.
What is striking is that none of the six 2.circle classes is achieved, here the innovative and moving circle will once again have to think about it.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend, there were protests from opponents of the NATO Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered into an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, around 150 people in Cardiff joined the city hall to hold a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for the weekend for us and has talked to demonstrators who travelled from Bridgent to Belgium.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains
Two young rabbits were brought into security with the rope after they were caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man stopped on Sunday in Govett Leap in Blackheath.
Worried relatives called the police at about 20 p.m. when the two were not back at home.
A search guide from local police and rescue services broke down and the pair was found around 23: 00 in the vicinity of the Bridal Veil Waterfalls.
The girl had fallen on his knees and the man was overthrown and had beaten his head.
Rescuers stayed at the pair for night and they were flown on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable state with a hospital in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
Around 1000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, the Minister of Information said Pervaiz Rashid.
After just half of an hour, the station was resumed.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged equipment in the editorial staff.
Deaths or injuries were not reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the Heads of State or Government.
The police told us that about one kilometer from the residence of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was brought back on Monday to clashes of around 3000 demonstrators with security forces.
After hospital data, a policeman has been injured.
On the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to invade Sharifs residence.
They are calling for the Prime Minister's resignation.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military called for a political settlement of the conflict, wasting time and using it without violence. ''
It was also mentioned in the communication: ``The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state. ''
The escalation of violence has fueled concern for military intervention, which has already had much more widespread use in the past.
Since the Independence Day on 14 August, the protests made by the opposition politician Imran Khan and Prediger Tahirul Qaddafi have been due to take place on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to withdraw.
Khan and Qaddafi had called for their supporters on Sunday.
``We are not going to decline without having to resign, ''Khan said.
Qaddafi has spoken in a similar way.
Khan discards that the parliamentary election was won by fraud in May last year.
Qaddafi is calling for the resignation of Central and the provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is supposed to reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the district of government.
At first, the demonstrators had peacefully defeated Parliament calling upon Khan and Qaddafi at the weekend to enter into Sharifs residence.
After two seasons of season, Hummdorfer will be on the table in three of the table.
With the 2: 0 on Val Gardena, for Rapid, a bitter week on Sunday ended up in conciliation.
``The victory is very liberating, ''said trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate head in the Europe League on Thursday.
``The experience of success was extremely important, ''Captain and Torprotective Steffen Hofmann confirmed that he had three of them with green white.
With the second season of season, Schrammel-Dream tor has shown the right response to the disappointment of Helsinki and is in contact with a successful experience in the country game break.
``We wanted to show a positive response, ''said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course of victory with his beautiful guide from the 1960s in the 14th minute.
``I thought I was watching the whole of the whole of Thursday and I made it under the`` Bar, ''I thought of the 26-year-old.
When on 13 April 2010 was taken in a federal state, it was still for Ried.
He will therefore stay in contact with him for the first championship in the Rapid-Dress.
``For me this is something quite special, I'm out of the rapid-boy, ''Schrammel said.
As a result of Mario Pavelic's short swimming pool, Schrammel from the left, Schrammel moved from the left to the right and made his cause very good.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position.
The gate has earned him, he has already done some assists this year, ''and Barisic praised him.
Team also shows character: 0 by Hofmann after a good one hour, which finally made the decision.
After all, it would also have been possible for the guests to write.
Thank God, we had something lucky today, ''Schrammel, who played on the gap of performance and earnings in recent weeks, also said: ``The results did not vote, but it was always good in comparison with last year.''
Barisic even found that ``in many of the games it was better than today - against`` the strongest team that played in that season in this stadium. ''
The first three-point since 26 July has therefore shown that the team structure was intact in spite of setbacks: ``Today my team has shown that it is character. ''
For him not less: ``We have finally played zero again. ''
A lot of work during the break of the country is also the fact that with Brian Bats, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger, several failures have been reported, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their debut debut, making victory even more precious.
``You must not forget that, ''Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Britten and Pavelic players, said`` they were very stable in recent times.''
The break of the country must therefore be used to ``clean up wounds, and in the physical field, ''said Barisic, who has five thirds of U21.
Captain Hofmann is one of those who are particularly close to the break.
He gets angry with the crew, he goes over pain.
Especially at this difficult period, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, ''which was Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game of Rapids before his confusion in the 68th minute, but also achieved the second gate.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350, he was the first hit from the game since 2 November 2013 -LRB- 4: 2 on the admira -RRB-.
Hofmann: ``We must not believe that now everything is good,`` We certainly had a bit of luck, but at some point the happiness must also come back.
Now it was high time, ''Hofmann said.
However, he was wary of concentration: ``You must not always see this in black and white.
In recent weeks we have not been so bad, as has been pointed out.
But we must not believe that everything is now good.
He was unable to contest the importance of his role in the team.
It is a very young team that I can very much help at the moment.
They think of me in certain phases, but Hofmann said.
It was not until the end of the year that there was a lot of fun to do.
He regretted the rapid backlash from the magic tor, as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40min, which was wrongly recognized by arbitrators.
The only charge I can make to the team is that in some phases we were not sufficiently specific towards Tor.
We had too little qualifications.
Defending Maximilian Karner was similar to it: ``It has started very badly, but then we found it only and even made a gate.
On the whole, more would have been in place.
There is no shortage of water and there is no shortage of water.
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series ``My piece by Rhöner happiness, ''on last Friday.
Several of these trees still exist in the district; the selected copy is the ``scourges ''above Unterweibrunn.
A walking path leads up to the about 600 years of old oak.
It is past Koppeln, Basaltsteinholm and Basaltsteinmeeren.
A piece of stone below the quarry of Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, it stands.
The natural monument is based on the natural monument; it towers over the other trees of the area and is reminiscent of an amount of more than eight metres of an American hole tree.
A small Buddha on a tree suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intense research, there were only references to the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bishop of Wikitravel and consulted older people from Unterweibrunn to find out what the change of life was with the scourges.
The result of his research was the rather sober statement for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the people of goat were supposed to have driven their animals from Unterweibrunn, from the more difficult and from the streets that were liberated by rocks.
At the foot of the tree, the animals exhausted by the rise are to be settled.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the fields of meadows there are actually goat herds.
The area has also been explained as part of the core area of the Biosphere Reserve.
You should let yourself be careful when entering the stone collections, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place of interest.
A footpath leads from Unterweibrunn to the tree, but it is hidden.
Further paths are available to climb towards Hochrhön and to invite you to a wide hike.
What is the place of water?
However, a waterburg, which is sought in our next task, is very rare.
There is already a good impression of the construction of the building, but in the district we have some historical buildings on which the building could fit.
Where is our ``piece of luck ''?

After a week of weeks, Italy Premier and the EU's President of the European Union, Matteo Renzi, won the nomination of his Secretary of State at the European Council of Ministers last week in favour of strong conservative resistance to the EU special summit, and it will be followed by the successor of the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, such as the government of La Repubblica, France, also considers it to be a favourite of the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects a boost to his `reform package 'in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to make it calm, because Mogherini is one of those who are increasingly in contact with him.
In comparison with the conservative representatives of the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the Council of Ministers, we will see the dominant opinion in Rome so that a political balance is created.
After all, the EU 's chief diplomacy will also be the deputy of the President of the Commission.
The European Parliament which is still absent is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would have mentioned the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the governing Democratic Party -LRB- PD -RRB- as an important recognition of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica optimism is that for almost two decades in leading party offices the ``enormous challenges ''have grown to show their ambitions.
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organisation of the so-called Democratici di Sinistra -LRB- Left Democrats -RRB-, which in 2008 merged with the Catholic Center Party Margherita to today's Social Democrats.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth -LRB- European Young Socialists -RRB-.
With the election in 2001 in the Party Council of the Left, she went into high party politics and worked in the foreign policy of foreign policy.
It was the traditional regional policy of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, and studies on NATO in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved in a cluster of troops, were aware of the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi was Prime Minister in February 2014, he was in charge of his foreign minister.
If the PD once again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to more than 40% of the party in the European elections in May, then, as in PD-circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The conversation in Brussels, which has too little diplomatic experience in the new EU's external committee, is thus lacking in substance, and the PD is going to grow.
In Brussels, especially from Poland and the Baltic States, realistic accents of fashion are persecuted for the crisis in Ukraine and diffused as a ``anti-grassroots course. ''
It is in favour of the Nord Stream pipeline run by the Russian firm, Gazprom, to be transported directly to southern Europe, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi began his term as Chairman of the European Union in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow.
Photos, which they showed with Putin at the Shake-hand, were captured in Brussels, just as they invited the Kremlin leader for October to attend a summit of Milan.

The Socialists in France should ``keep the mouth and order France, ''said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left of the Left to show their love for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet was overthrown by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves all of his respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
``It is our duty to stay on his side, ''he said.
As an important gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite heavy demands for a relaxation of the regime of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.

``And the new will not survive the fall or winter,`` said to let Le Pen stand up for supporters.
She repeated the reputation of her party after a dissolution of Parliament and said that she was confident to emerge as the winner of early elections and be prepared for the government.
The ruling party of France was struck by defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front at the European elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking into several rival groups before the end of the term of the term of the term of the term `Dutch '.
Pascal Perrineau, a politician at the Sciences Po University, warned against the fact that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and the employment of the new socialist government.
``There is a small window for options, but public opinion must feel fast that things change, ''he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.

Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A pekingfidelity group moved close to the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the permanent committee of the National Assembly passed a framework law, which will only allow for only two or three candidates for the decision in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support for a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with pekingloyal members.
By means of this decision, it will be almost impossible for opposition democrats to vote in favour and to use pro-democracy activists to make their threats and to dismantle the financial area of Hong Kong with ``Occupy Central ''protests.
Political reforms have long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong; and China's party leaders fear that calls for democracy spread to other cities.
After the release of a Beijing White Paper, which was presented in June by China's dominance of Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on electoral procedures in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands of people in the city of the city marched and organized a sit-in.
Lis questionnaire is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The deputy chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice President of the Office for Affairs of Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei should be consulted in the course of the day.
Student activists advised to gather in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Until the end of the year, Britain has not seen any democratic elements until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin calls from Kiev to take the ``state of state talks ''with the Ostukraine.
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media, on Sunday, the Russian government announced that the Ukrainian Government will cease fighting against the United Nations separatists in the east and will immediately start negotiating the breakaway region of the breakaway region.
Later, his spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, made it clear that Putin did not mean that under control of the separatists a part of Russia would become part of Russia, but that his status with Ukraine must be redefined in order to give power to the Russian-speaking region to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to Kiev's government to negotiations on an eye with the pro-Russian insurgents, but seems to adapt to the strategy that has followed by him since the start of the aftermath of the riots over five months,: Aid to the separatists and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossiya de facto independence for an alliance with Russia
In an interview with the national TV channel channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the territories of the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which took place in March and April in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
In recent times, the Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the ``Novorossija ''or`` New Russia,'' a concept that reminds us of the pre-revolutionary glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians, are in favour of the elections on 26, and while government groups of civilian communities in the territories that were held by separatists are likely to be trapped in their illusions, ''Itar-Tass reported.
``We immediately need to start detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state of the state of South-East to preserve the interests of the people who live there. ''
Peskov said that Putin's reference to the state is to be seen in the context with greater autonomy, which has been discussed since months of the Kiev leadership, to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
It is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, ``because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine. ''
The statement by the Kremlin for correcting Putin's remarks highlighted Russia's declaration of leadership when dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, unlike the direct rise of the Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants of ethnic Russians are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in the Ostukraine, because most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from time before the conflict gave rise to a broad majority for the country that was left in Ukraine.
The autonomy mentioned by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate own trade and foreign relations, and to give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula of the Black Sea five months ago is the port port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Nagorno-Karabakh region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on the inauguration of the United Nations Convention on 7 June, the Ukrainian President Petro Poroishi proposed that Ukrainian legislation should consider the constitution of the Constitution, which would include greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his vision of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, which is accused of creating weapons and setting up Moscow.
Putin's latest demand in Kiev to negotiate with the separatists leaders to an level of equality, was followed after a continued attack on the rebels in the last week, after Russia troops and tanks over the former peaceful region of the Sea of the Sea to enter the Baltic Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, are the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Nowoasowsk.
That is why massive civilian and military preparations have begun to support Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants that is between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea Peninsula.
On Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels, Porostan urgently asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
``We are on top of a point on which there is no return, ''Porostan warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine's territory.
The EU Summit did not adopt any specific actions, calling for the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which are to enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks of tanks and 1,000 soldiers joined the Donetov region to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council was forced to withdraw from Kiev on Saturday in Kiev.
The first of these were about 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped in Ilowajsk, and on Sunday they were replaced by 10 Russian pitfalls, which had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko informed Lysenko on Sunday.
Nutfotoscandal about Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret about his anger about hackers, who presumably stolen the naked images of his wife, Gabi Grecko, and a Who of the A Who stolen the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is in turmoil, after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacker scandal around Promis on the Internet.
The hackers, who are responsible for this, probably have more than 60 nudist photos of Lawrence, Star of the Tribute of panem and superstars, including the models of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, of the singers of Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actresses of Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were allegedly also published on the basis of a sexier.
On the list are 101 of Promis.
Most of the last month with Grecko said, ``It's wrong. ''
All private letters and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information is stolen and can be passed on to others.
Grecko, at a time in New York, according to reports, according to reports, a news website said that the Hack was ``shamefully ''and that those affected felt`` injured.''
The hackers will probably have 30 images of palmer with their former friend, Scott Speedman, including two recordings that are at the top of the pool.
Among the film works of Palmers, ``Love is undefeated ''with Liam Hemsworth.
Yesterday, Palmer, Chuck Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the chopped images.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ: ``It is an outrageous violation of privacy. ''
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hackers in his Tweet: ``Come images from a cell phone is nothing more than the sale of dog ware. ''
From a legal point of view, it should not be possible to tolerate the dissemination of stolen images.
At the end of the 20th century, at the end of the 20th century, he was one of the most successful cities in the world.
The tour, which was one of them, was an easy training for the other.
In one day, however, everyone agreed: It has been fun.
Thomas Studanski was likely to have slept well at night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler brewery took place yesterday with the wheel on the Feldberg.
For the good purpose.
It is easy to remove the small muscle kater, which is because he has personally brought a valuable insight into the participation of the Great Feldberg in favour of the association.
That is a great thing.
``I now know that I can do this - perfect! ''
Is there any way to get out of the way of the applause?
Snow, if I had stopped once, he was out of his life.
Like Thomas Studanski, who is seated in the Chamber of Lords in the Chamber of Lords, many of the 718 participants died yesterday in spring to mountains and came close to exhaustion.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the good eleven kilometres between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
At the end of the day, the very latest of Green's politicians from the course of the day - red Dress, red Bike - at the start of the day there was still something on understatement -LRB- ``Every amount of professionals here is the target! ''-RRB-, but then proved to be half a professional and went for 45 minutes without breathing after 45 minutes.
He was also driving the route in a slide, such as Nina Kuhn, Pressesprecherin of the City of Oberursel.
For the two triathlon athletes, ``Feldberg-Radeln ''was not necessarily a sports challenge:`` here we are talking about charity, we would like to have an exit - we would already have made it today,'' Kuhn.
On the way, they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy -LRB- 12 -RRB- was left to Oberursel in the morning to return to the height.
At the end of the morning at 9: 00 at the end of the year, the Frankfurt Florian decorz was back in the saddle, ``made the field mountain two times to roll with fun at home.
It was also called ``Fritten-Toni. ''
For the head of the Oberurseler cult kiosks, bike tours through Feldberg are simply one of them.
He had taken 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo wheel wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to do so, ''Andreas Balzke said.
The trained Mainzer says that it is a ``ambitious racer. ''
He also has to be one of them, because he was on the road.
It was not only the 20 walkers who climbed up above the White Wall and left the centre of the summit, but also a Jogger, who at a Kordel came to the top of the church.
He is one of the most beautiful in the world and it is one of the most beautiful places in the world.
The 718 participants - and thus so many as never before - were sent to the line in the morning.
The hikers first arrived at 9.30 a.m
It was followed by the first cyclists and runners at 10.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers stopped.
Led Hansen, Chairman of the Association of Radeln on the Great Feldberg, gave the start commands and wished to visit the participants.
For next year, he hopes that it will succeed in blocking the course of the field mountain to the safety of participants.
