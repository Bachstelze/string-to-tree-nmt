Returning to the very American ideal of the working rights as human rights
The Congress for Congress and John Lewis have put forward a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights.
``As trade unions die, too will die the middle class jobs, ''said Ellison, a democrat of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud to be proud of the Staff Regulations Act.
This pioneering law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions such as other forms of discrimination - to stop anti-union forces.
The addition of the national legal law to create an opportunity for discrimination against workers in the organisation of a trade union in order to complain about justice before a civil court and to obtain compensation or penalties.
But there is certainly no radical initiative, certainly not to American standards.
Indeed, the best way is to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal suggest, to a very American idea.
In spite of the setbacks that have been exposed to the trade unions over the past few years, Americans have once again encouraged Americans to recognise, extend and comply with working rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, free speech, freedom of the press and the right of association.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his family encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy was replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions have a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that the rights of workers are guaranteed on association and on joint negotiation and action.
When the United States meets Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his team are the Germans to write a constitution that would make sure that fascism replaced Adolf Hitler by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organise, and their voice to be raised in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly said: ``The right to establish associations to safeguard and improve the work and economic conditions.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it are zero and void; this is illegal.
When the former First Lady was chaired by the International Commission on Human Rights, the General Declaration of Human Rights was drafted by the United Nations by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the other author, to guarantee that any of them has the right to defend their interests or to join them. ''
For generations, Americans have been able to accept the fundamental rights of human rights.
As this country, Americans told us how to shape civilian and democratic societies, that the right to establish a union - that this trade union should be protected as an equivalent partner with companies and government authorities.
Indeed, following these rights in America, it is indeed very wise to give the American ideal to the fore, which is why the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free, open society.
As Martin Luther King Wilson said fifty years ago, that was said:
History is a great teacher.
Now all of us know that the labor movement does not reduce the nation's strength, but enlarged them.
By increasing the living standards of millions of people, work has created a market for industry and has raised the whole nation on an unprecedented level of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history keeps them.
History reminds, and that is what we should do.
The formal recognition of the rights of human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights, as the protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Kevin Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and got the promise of democracy.
Judge stops on a temporary law that all forms of abortion are forced to be closed.
On Sunday, a U.S. Federation stopped the implementation of a law in California, by the lawyers, that it would probably have ended up to all of us.
This measure, raised by Felix Jindal, Governor of California, in June, and on 1 September, would force doctors who are carrying out abortion to acquire a patient service at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortion for the time being.
``The plaintiff can continue to carry out law, while they try to obtain these rights, ''wrote Federal judge John devolelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing is scheduled for the judge to make a more lasting decision for the law.
The decision was welcomed by the youngest in a series of judgments against similar measures.
``The decision taken today means that women are going to miss the wrong law that wants to take their health and rights, ''said Nancy Norup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproduction rights, in the name of three of the five hospitals in the State, to stop the law.
It was not just clear whether the verdict was also extended to the doctors from the two clinics, which the complaint did not apply.
It is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws.
Key to a law in Texas, which was the majority of the hospitals remaining in the state was stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
The American College of Ostelltricians and Gynecthos as well as the American Medical Association have agreed to demand unnecessary restrictions on the rights of doctors.
Contrary to what is said, the measures are aimed at protecting the health of women, although some have also welcomed the effects of the closure of hospitals.
Only a doctor who is carrying out abortion has the center of reproductive rights.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to carry out abortion, this doctor would no longer carry out the surgery.
In their argument against the judgment, the representatives of the State said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortion.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates by egg cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have sent a video for their mother online.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of egg cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data from more than 1100 Australian companies, and found that only 25% of them were still in life after the diagnosis.
The research of the researchers of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDER: New medicinal products could slow down lung and egg cancer.
Researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of woman influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was further advanced for the diagnosis, survival rate was lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions, the mortality risk was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the town died of the more likely loss of egg cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that a delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centers are possible factors for this.
``This disease is treated in the best of gynaological Onkologists, and these are usually found in major cities, ''`` she said.
In spite of improving telematics services to counter the distances, they proposed a strengthening of the service of frozen doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women with their place of residence.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, irrespective of geographical status, showed a bad life rate for women in egg cancer and stressed the need for better treatment.
The study carried out by Rio Tinto will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elther Neave, a young mother of 33 years, learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of egg cancer.
Garden centers to regret a lack of domestic ownership
The decline, together with a reinforced Sinken of the number of people under 35 years, could lead to the loss of 10 thousand pounds per year if the young consumers today are reporting after a study of HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that passengers spend an average of 55 percent of the amount to spend people in their garden.
The growth of people who live in highly urban areas without gardens are the popular process of constructing parks for parking purposes and threatening the garden size, threatening the industry, which is estimated to be estimated $5 billion in sales.
In the area of London, in the case of a period of 6 years, the minimum expenditure on garden products per household will be reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horwark Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can not plants
Guy Barter, chief chef for the RHS, said: ``container fermentation is very popular for rent, for example, because they can take their plants in a move.
The HTA report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the ``golden age ''of the garden because of rising domestic property and economic prosperity from the late 1980'' s until the middle of the 1990s.
He also predicted a better market situation for the better flying weather in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan goes further to the protest movement in Pakistan.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators have raised the State Television PTV.
Information minister Pervaiz Raskel said that soldiers could have been able to push out of PTV buildings.
The transmitter sent its operation for about 40 minutes.
At the same time, about 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometre away from that, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police led Trenengas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharifs resignation, but that is rejected.
The army of the country meanwhile calls for a political solution to the conflict, without wasting time and without applying violence.
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military told the army to guarantee the security of the state.
The military plays an important role in Pakistan.
The opposition politician Imran Khan raises Prime Minister Sharif when the parliamentary election in May last year.
The protests took place in the weekend after Khan and his followers had called upon their followers to resign to Sharifs Residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey ordered U.S. diplomat on the basis of espionage.
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed the oldest US diplomats in the country to enter into a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs said that the business officers of the US and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The mirror as well as the online magazine The IntercConcept, show that Turkey was a major practice area for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan found the importance of the report and said that all the important countries have become members of each other.
A previous report, which was also targeted at the most important intelligence service in Germany Ankara, caused a much more disrespectful response from the Turkish Government.
Warning: The guides are threatening to compete with the consequences for commors.
The Federal Ministry of Justice could also interfere with the movement of people in Germany on Monday evening.
The event was announced for 18 to 21.
The main sequence of warning is freight transport.

Said the district leader of the trade union of the Federal Trade Organization -LRB- GDL -RRB-, in Düsseldorf, in Düsseldorf.
We expect a lot of delays.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main sequence of warning is the movement of goods.
Deutsche Bahn announced that everything should be done to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where she likes to strike, that it is difficult to predict the consequences.
Die Polielect of Magokf of corruption
On Friday, on Friday the office of the Public Prosecutor provided evidence for blackmail by police officers and employees of the town of Calvià.
The chef of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested after corruption allegations by businessmen and barowners in the notorious Binge-free estate Maggorf.
The main Commissioner of José Antonio was taken against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which the majority of bars and nightclubs are by Maggorf.
Following the information of the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the Ministry of Justice presented the Office of the Public Prosecutor for the fight against corruption on Friday evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of Calvià.
Two others have been arrested by the Spanish Civil Civil in relation to corruption and are consulted jointly by a judge.
The national Spanish daily newspaper ABC reported that the angry night dog owners said that the authorities have a serious impact on their business.
``It is no longer money to earn, ''said one of the businessmen in the court.
Let our livelihoods come from the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer, Magacrof took up international headlines on the basis of a six-year-old British tourist that took place in 24 men.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the unlawful behaviour of non-alcoholic tourists in Maggorf, by minimizing the number of participants to the notorious non-alcoholic beverages.
The Playhouse Club, in which the coat took place, was forced for a year of closure, while Playhouse and the pub Carnage have to pay a penalty of 55,000 €-LRB- 73,000 -RRB-.
The tourist town Maggorf, who is popular with young British tourists, is also known for several accidents in alcohol, including the ``Balconing, ''in which people jump from one balcony to the other or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first time of early life with wet weather conditions is caused by flights from the airport.
The spring has brought South Africa a winter surprise, with strong showers and strong wind, that caused flights from the airport.
In the evening until 21 p.m. there fell to the city after 6.6mm, which was already in the night for Sunday.
The final result was the result of a series of short and long runs, including a gopping, which started shortly before 20 am, for almost 4mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter of last week, the temperatures in the city on Monday fell to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C
The bad weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight of Virgin Airlines of Melbourne.
The plane had to land shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a hammer wind - a sudden change in the wind speed or a short distance from the road.
The wind reached about 50 km @/@ h on the ground on the airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start on a second landing flight and finally set up about 20.40.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some of the other flights, including one from Dubai and a quantas flight from Sydney.
For Liverpool, a maximum temperature temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday.
Matthew is one of the most important in the world.
In the face of the fascinating technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech switches, Bernd Matthew is with a very familiar electronic accessory.
While I write this here, I look at the spiral cable, which connects the phone to the phone, and I think: Boah, which is what is happening?
But behind that: If the cable would not be, would be able to fly in the house in a very short time.
Anyway, anyway, on the ekeltronic?
No, typographical errors: Electronic -RRB- the rule that the world premiere of today is the electric waste of tomorrow - outdated.
And those of us today have a silver TV in the living room that says that he is rejecting television in principle.
Why?
Because we are pushing the Ifa on the radio tower in this week, our absolute incompetence leads to questions about electronics.
The Laie, who was blind to the washing machine and CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the equipment that will spread to him: ``Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies promise us the press office.
Yes, what's going on?
What are we going to talk about people who seem to spread voluntarily?
In fact, for about 20 years, we have been in favour of linking our house.
That is why the yoghurt takes care to tell us that it is burning out in the working room.
And would it not be wonderful when we come from the office out of the air condition on our immediate arrival?
Yes, that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will definitely be true: We put our hands in our hands, say ``Saugen! ''
It is misleading.
Everything is going to be less than a revolution: ``The boundaries between white and brown goods will combine the washing machine, you can combine the washing machine with a headphones, the steam bath will show the weather report and the data brille shows how long the pizza is needed in the oven, but what does nothing make sure because we stand in stau.
From daily practice we know that if a newer device is really needed, the battery is empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable will survive on the phone.
Israeli children are returning to their schools after the war in Gaza.
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near Gaza returned to schools on Monday, when they had spent the summer in air defence, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, the schools stayed in Gaza.
The school start was a feeling of joy and expectation, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, employees of the ``Pashosh ''children garden, which was hit by a rocket, went to the walls and boots in the old town of Ashdod.
``We have a bit of fear, but they are excited, ''said that Ronit dons.
Many children from our area urgently need the return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani of Shani said that she feels ``a bit of fun ''to go once again into school.
``It was difficult times, and we did not go out of the house, ''she said.
President Revven Sinlin visited Kigi near the border with Gaza to offer its support.
Until a ceasefire last week, thousands of residents of the border communities stayed in their homes, or left their homes to escape from Gaza in safer areas.
Many residents of the Middle East, a municipality near the border with Gaza, are still returning to the return.
The Ministry of Education told us that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children have been housed in other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town on Gaza.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said that we will make sure that your knowledge can be acquired.
Israel and Hamas agreed on a permanent ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided for an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, as Hamas's demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Palestinian blockade in Gaza is in Gaza.
Israel is asking for the disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two to the fighting.
A new round of indirect discussions is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of civilians, and at least 494 children after estimates of the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these claims and estimates that it is at least half of the movement but does not have any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza broke 4.591 rockets and brain granents during the fighting in Israeli cities, which are most in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli military led to more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks were damaged or destroyed by thousands of homes in the Gaza region, with about 100 UN schools.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective rooms, the education authorities postponed last week at the beginning of the school year.
``I hope the school will soon be opened so that we can learn further, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children, ''said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl is questioning NPD
In the face of the death loss of the NPD in Saxony, CDsubsole has expressed itself as the end of the current NPD ban before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - Laut CD subsole by Thomas Strobl will find the current prohibition procedure against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court.
``The NPD is worse off than in the last time, ''said Strobl, who is also CDUland in Baden-Württemberg.
This is a good development in the right direction and development that leads me to the result to fight the NPD politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
In the vote on Sunday, the NPD failed to fail.
A first attempt for a ban on the right was failed in 2003.
In December 2013, the Federal Council received a new request in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now housed in tents now.
The headquarters of the headquarters for refugees in Harburg turned out of all the seams.
Now, the internal authority has put in place three tents from the Red Cross.
The members of the Chamber have just been informed - they are hardly enthusiastic.
``There are no opportunities for the citizens and do they not have any opportunity to participate constructively in the humane housing of refugees, ''says the President of the Group of the Greens, in the Harburger District Meeting.
Their party claims that the district administration of Harburg is available for accommodation at the moment.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reason for filling up in the first photograph is the Anran of Help - and the fact that the authorities are unable to provide enough places in the future.
Many refugees remain longer than the normal three months.
The skin prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years.
The RP-data from Monday in August rose to 1.1 percent in August.
By this increase lies the total increase in June, July and August at 4.2 percent, the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more like the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not distributed evenly over the country.
The research director of WMData, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne have a two-divided market.
The figures of WMData show that the skin prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, against 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Liverpool, Brisbane and Darwin, in which prices rose by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, the scale of the spectrum lies in the volume of government spending.
Mr Lawless further said that, in the early seasons, the next few months would be a rise in the properties that the market would have on the market.
``When you look at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate, and the constantly low interest environment, it is probably that the home journey will continue to rise in the next three months, ''said he.
In an opinion on the New Press, he is contrary to the statements by the business leader of peer Medau.
The style of the university is not.
That is why the Medau family was informed about the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only known in July are definitely wrong.
At the same time, it refers to the fact that the plans are not ``pre-found ''and decisions, but would be`` preferences.''
The expansion of the narrow road to the castle is also less dramatic than from the Medaus.
From about nine meters wide road was and is not the speech.
It goes to 5.50 meters, that is a meter wider than before.
The argument of the Medau operators is that they will only be used by students of the university.
Because this can be solved intelligently, it is now intelligently solved by other public parking spaces.
Thinking about residents
There is a lot of people who want to stay in the area.
In fact, it is important to bear in mind, that it is not just about the children, but also about the people of the people.
It is therefore a lot of things that are far greater than in the interests of the gentlemen of Medau.
Whether the criticism of the child was criticised, with the expansion of the road, one of the few natural spots of Coburgs would be ``the reader can decide. ''
At the beginning of October, Pruml wants to inform the city about the development of the university by 2020.
Peer Medau last week informed the parents of the children about the plans of the university.
Therefore, the access to the new parking deck is not going to lead to the campus and then to the Medau Berg.
In this way, the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometre.
According to the high accounts of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Burgundy would make ten times.
There are about 2,000 vehicles per day.
In the past, we did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf comes from handball team.
Dominique Glandorf will no longer play for the DHCP team.
The 60th anniversary of the Federal Ministry of Commerce led to health problems for this decision.
The decision is not easy to say, she is living over several months.
It's for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team.
It is therefore taking stock of 167 country games and 576 gates for Germany in international retirement.
Because of the fact that there is still a lot of people, he will no longer be able to go to the new federal trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Islands who announced on Tuesday his Kader for the country games against Switzerland, Glandorf introduced a long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have enjoyed me as much as she will enjoy.
But for my club I would like to be healthy in the next few years.
In 2012, the left wing had to fear his career.
As a result of Achilles, he had treated himself from the team doctors of the German Handballbundes -LRB- DHB -RRB- with a cortisoninjection that later triggered a strong inflammation.
A emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then, Glandorf announced a complaint against the team doctor who ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven national music go to no body.
I have a number of health sites that I can not ignore
After the three attacks on foot operations that took place in 2012, I never got my blood pressure in the grip.
For this purpose, there are a number of other self-related complaints.
As early as the beginning of the year I noticed that I am going to control my head, but my body can not be '
For a comeback, it would only be ready for absolute emergency.
``When all take up, I'm always talking, ''explained the two-fold family father.
But I can count on one hand the years in which I can play.
I also have to say that, after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have become a fairly defriendly thing about what my health concerns.
After my career, I would like to go at least than ever.
In addition to the 2008 and the winner of the Champions League in 2014, he took part in 2008 -LRB- HSG Nordhorn -RRB- and in 2010 -LRB- TBV Lemgo -RRB-.
In 2012 he also secured the Europapokal of the Pokalwinner.
German Economy in the spring of 0.2 percent
The crises around the globe have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014.
This shared the Statistical Office and confirmed preliminary calculations.
Alone, the economy in the spring, while the investment went back.
The economy is also slowing down the economy.
The first half of the year was the first half of the year on the first half of the year, compared with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the target of the ``grand map ''that led to the castle on Sunday.
The castle of Horstmar lived on Sunday an invasion of Dutch ``Fietzenriders. ''
The biggest wheel sports association of the Netherlands, NTFU was organized.
Here you will find yourself the biggest bike tour on the east coast.
More than 1000 participants thanked themselves with their registration at Donald ter Hueno for the organization of this tour.
These tours have been offered in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and went overnight to participate in this tour.
We would like to learn this way.
After registering in the association, Sta takes place.
She went to the city about the wall, where the journey was started.
Further led the route that was posted for three different categories, in the direction of Man, in the direction to Coesfeld, in the direction of Coesfeld, in the direction of Coesfeld, and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres, with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 metres and 145 km with 1775 altitude meters cyclists have proved their good condition.
They have been covered in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main example of the course was the success of this cycle.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all parties.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents, ''Heinz Lölbegan took a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, as many people as the organizer had hoped what was probably the bad weather forecast.
``We will be able to return to the summer months in 2015, but the cyclists have returned again and plan to start the event.
The reason for this is that there is no doubt that they are free of charge.
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, in the case of the death of Wecker, singer, Pacific.
It was not chronologically, but more thoughts for thought networks was written by his memoirs on 1 June 1947, each chapter takes place through a matching song text.
And he is free of all honesty: From the Onanie to the shop theft and drug use that he does not have a human weakness.
Also, in order to show how he has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow people.
There are also abstract things about abstract, but the all the more important terms are: Love, soul, Ego, that is in the Now, spirituality - all he tries to go on the grounds, on a very philosophical basis, but also in a personal manner.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and also as it did not just shaped music.
The latter has also brought the living to the asketic monk, who, as he says, ``by making everything. ''
Between all the highly spiritual views, there are also short anecdotes to the earth.
He is also very honest about that.
Lenny Henry: My father has never taken me in the arm.
Has never said ``I love you
Henry was one of seven children in Dudley in Dudley in 1958.
His father, as Henry 19 was, worked in a factory and its relationship.
Henry tested for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father, from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of regent and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work with a number of difficult children.
He visited ``many ''therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is beyond his relationship with his father.
It was difficult to know him.
There was never his face, but just heard his voice:
Let your sister be quiet.
Think about you!
I would like to look at bands.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - which have already grown - went to him in the pub and talked about things such as the form of beer.
I have never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life he was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a consortium in Dudley, while the conditions are better than during his father but have a look at how to have been the life of him.
It is now a bit lighter, but she is dark, tired, deep.
My father was once in the bath and then he was able to listen to him how to sing because he was able to wash.
When I went around, it was clear to me that he had done this for years to give the food to the table.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without love of his parents.
My father never said that he never said ``I love you. ''
Only when my mother went badly against the end of her life, we began, ``I love you, I love you, I love to say.
Through his own daughter Billie, he was able to share the love he was missing as a child.
Let's stop you with the ``I love you ''?
Oh, I would like to get rid of ourselves!
Hello, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still in French that he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
She was a mother of her own mother.
That contributed to her death.
So when I was very keen to show symptoms of diabetes, my physician needs to be radical.
So I moved to this fitness and had to make a dramatic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is hard.
No one likes to eat.
Henry's career change can be found in its elegant, short cut bar.
Since he was praised by the critics, he was united by the theatre.
It followed the comedy of the misings, and then Falls of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and compartments that have filled his busy working life.
He started with just 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage and wrote about him.
His television began in the middle of the 1970s. ``I was for a very long time of the only Black Imitator / Comcoon on television. ''
He learned in the profession.
I had to learn not only about the public but also from 1975 to 1985, and I was able to become an efficient Witze-narrative machine, while the television was a star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 in New Faces
Since his manager had the stage law on the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people ``black anmold ''led Henry his comedy there for five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I would somehow hope that it would never happen, but I regret that I have done it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a great audience.
But this ``years of award-winning light pillar of British television ''was also a`` grotesque parch of black people.''
By the introduction of the figures that the British black culture has celebrated, Henry worked in the 1980s on an alternative Comedycircle.
The first series of lenny Henry Show was published in 1984.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series, and film rolls took place in the next decade, but after its BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: ``what do you want to do? ''because it feels as if you only feel the time.
Then a documentary series for Radio 4 came to the title.
The first consequence was about Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare I was actually allergic.
I had never learned him about him in school and was mostly in favour of a domain of the middle class.
That is why I feared great fear.
All that we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Yang n, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said you should try it.
Do not go bad if you do n't know what you are doing.
Take a couple of words in the mouth and then understand why we love all Shakespeare.
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary and was enthusiastic.
I had the feeling that I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put the head in the right direction.
``That is what it is, it is a serious matter, you are serious about your text, you will learn a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that did not happen.
And soon he went to the comedy.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe.
There was a moment when I thought, ``Oh, you have changed you.
There was a technical error and Henry felt that he had to listen to the audience.
``A small voice told me`` You have to bridge 10 minutes, while they repair the computer.
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea would go as soon as the problem was solved.
I went out of the stage and something in me said ``Oh, God is to me.
I am not responsible for that.
I can leave that to someone else.
``You play in a play play, therefore stay in your role.
Henry in Falls on Dush Theatre
The text was learned to learn.
Panic is very good, and that strengthens the view.
That too was good, and it is like a great sign of the gods that tell me.
He says this, of course, with a Thursday vote.
That is what I would like to do.
I love that.
I love to be in a sample room.
Henry has always had the head of a comcoon - our conversation is broken away by a lot of emotion.
I decided not to make a stand-alone comedy, because I think that this type of immediate satisfaction is dangerous to a room of any kind.
If you look for it you will go to a wall.
I'm sometimes working live in Apollo, but on the whole there are not as much as before.
I wonder whether he will once again make a stand-alone Comedytour.
The fun I have in one room with a director who helps to make a start, and the end of a journey - I do not believe I want to give up.
Is that the new Inkarnation?
I think it is.
I'm happy to be an actor.
It is fun.
There is always a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi-Rebgens are blocking roads in Yemen's capital.
In the conflict between Shia Huthi-Rebgens and the Yalta government, the Huem has been called into the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi had central roads in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman of the Huthi-Party.
The access to Parliament was also blocked.
Ashenite media report of a traffic chaos in the capital.
Following the use of the online edition of the newspaper, Huthi-leaders had called for the action on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened to have a further escalation of the conflict, and should not meet his demands.
The Shia chicken is fighting for more independence from the Sunni Yemen and is asking the government to resign.
For about two weeks, the Huthi was the capital of the island.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps in the great vicinity of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are always bloody battles with the Yalta army.
Kenya registered officials to ``ghost workers
Kenya has started to register all state officials, in order to delete `ghost workers' from the government's salary lists.
Employees who would not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay, was a government communication.
The government claims that thousands of people are still receiving salaries from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenya promised to combat corruption in the public service.
In a test at the beginning of this year, at least 1 million per month was lost in payments for ``ghost workers ''.
The government claims that salaries continue to be paid to accounts after a person died or leaves the public service
All officials will now appear in the next two weeks at identification centers to make sure that their data are included through biometric registrations.
All who did not go out of the salary list went on to go on.
``This approach will contribute substantially to rationalising the public service, by identifying the actual number of officials, by eliminating the salary list on both government levels - that is what the`` ghost workers ''are being eliminated,'' said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal about the art adviser Helge Achenbach will be held in court on 11 November.
Five of the heirs to the Aldi's founder of the Italian, son of the Aldi, are asking for compensation from Achenbach and two of its companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was published on Monday on Monday.
In the thesis, Achenbach dismissed the purchase of works of art works, and in the event of real estate prices, calculated higher than indeed purchase prices.
That was also the result of the agreed commission.
Achenbach purchased for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school service in 44 years, including 23 as a school director.
From this time, Manfred Richter is aware of many detandous Petershausener and collision from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always due to his desire to see people.
The snow tea is the most popular mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Judges was born in 1930 in Trautenau @/@ northern Bohemia, today Trutnov.
Already with 14 he met for the teacher profession after four years.
A year after that, the Sugha German was lifted.
Within half a hour, the family had to leave their house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946.
That's why it was going to go to justice in the middle of the valley.
The teacher formation took place in Heidelberg.
For this reason, Manfred Richter had to take ten kilometres to the next train station for ten kilometres, and on the evening back to the centre to go for three kilometres across the entire city.
After two months, Manfred Richter received a sleeping room in a Red Cross Home in Germany: Together with up to 15 mites in a sleeping room.
In 1951 he made the first in 1954 after three years of teaching.
Since Oberfranken had no free lessons for him, he went to Oberbayern and came to the school on 1 November 1954.
The ``milling room ''was its first`` service apartment'' in the school house.
In 1958 he referred to a three-room service apartment in the newly-built teacher house.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school was dissolved in Karlsruhe in 1968.
Until then, there have been three classes in the school association of Petershausen-Beibach.
From the school year in 1968 @/@ 69, these were brought together in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary class remained in the place.
In order to avoid a return in the smaller school, the then release of Georg Sigl changed to Karlsruhe - and Manfred Richter.
But Petershausen grew up, and from September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to build today's construction, in 1997.
Manfred Richter is the most comfortable of the former Ministry of Culture, with the exception of a workshop room and the expansion of 1997.
``The mayor of Götz was very busy, ''judge reminded.
In his whole career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative, who responded to a meeting of a school council on law and justice.
``You have to give the children two things: Roots and wings, ''says today 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: ``That does not succeed ''.
In any case, judge was sometimes illegal.
When students looked after themselves, they did not work on him and did not sit for them.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had to create two pairs of boxed shoes and took them against each other.
For the benefit of the school, judges took a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz -LRB- CSU -RRB-.
In 1996, she was able to meet the party, at least as a last on the CSS list for the local authorities.
But judges was elected on the ground and went to the CSU.
180 km in three days.
HR4-RADTOAST offers about 50 people in the spa park in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen.
If Radler is on her tour in Bad Salzhausen, this is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of people will have the impression that the 700 participants of the 4-Radtour enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the free sky in the Scottish Alteburgpark.

Cold refreshments have been possible to enjoy the drinks in the gym.
The ``Duo Bravo ''kept the visitors with well-known melodies from operettes and musicals and took enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park has been relaxing.
A Lord also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: `He deserves it, and finally he has already put him back to the frozen bicycle chains today.
Meanwhile, the mayor and the crew had to work.
She was also interested in working on the site.
It was also the first time that he was able to give him the opportunity to meet.
``the majority of participants came from the Rhine-Main region, ''said he.
The number of participants is a bit about the accommodation capacity that is available to you.
In category I, participants will be accommodated in hotels, in category II in collections.
From the spa, the Radler had a good impression when she broke out for about one and a half hours: ``Chüss!
``It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!
After the arrival in Schots, the group was able to take a brief break.
But in the evening the wheels were requested in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for tourism and urban marketing -LRB- GTS -RRB-, the park has been given a beautiful festive atmosphere and has naturally been prepared.
Ministry of Culture and the Board of Directors welcomed the visitors in his role as a member of the Board of Directors.
The three were clearly pleased about the ``many operations. ''
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance platform.
The opportunity to eat was used in the bike in spite of the sporting activities.
Among the guests there are an increasing number of people who have been able to enjoy themselves.
On the second day, for cyclists, the stations of Birstein, Falltersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert.
The athletes met in Bad Vilbel yesterday, after 180 kilometres.
Dozens of Turkish police officers for the government against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as a result of the suspicion of the ``conspiracy against the government. ''
The police authorities did not have a direct comment.
Under the arrests there are 14 senior police officers, filed in English.
Some of them have been involved in corruption against government officials, including four government ministers in December last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -LRB- who was Prime Minister -RRB- described her as part of the activities that are attributed to him and others in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday -LRB- 1 September -RRB- after the summer holiday.
This day is traditionally an important day for families.
He told him that he did not open all schools, however, that he decided to defend the country for future generations:
The September 2010 was not held in every school.
The sky is not everywhere about Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge joint Ukrainian population in Ukraine must fight for a peaceful sky.
He was born in Sjurjansk, who visited the school in Sjurjansk, who visited the school in Sjurjansk.
We hope that there will finally be peace and that the children will have a education that will be useful to them.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated while the children wear, keep in the hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC was perhaps the great director she needs.
She meets with a proud rest from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tor Party.
And she has its own front experience.
Her career began in the worldwide management advisory company, Bain and Co..
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and went back to a younger male colleagues as the top post of the mother company Pearsons.
Their withdrawal supposedly amounted to almost 1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by David Cameron of Lord, the former Chairman of BP when she was looking for more private knowledge in Gujarat.
Your husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May I described the task of the Chairman with a poisoned Kelch.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence is in two directions: On the inside, the first guard has become a voice of public concern and anxiety when things are going to be wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol that calls for a full comprehensive reform.
But what sort of new leader it would risk, go to everything and spread an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while it may be his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if it were enough, many are interested to see the BBC - power, money, and status.
While competition is closer to the future, new technologies are threatening to threaten the BBC with a special risk to the BBC.
For the modest sum of 145.50 per year, the British public will buy the world in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: She says that it reaches 96% of all budgets and costs only 40 pence per day.
And apparently, the BBC is increasing its popularity at the top of the past: 53 percent supporting them today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The visual and user habits for the BBC have changed: I get news on my cell phone today and see the desired programs later on on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she has found it.
Perry from Texas says that they did not authorize Tweet
A Tweet of the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday there was a decrease in the democratic community lawyer, which is at the heart of a criminal charge against him.
The Tweet was later replaced by a different form of Perl.
Just a Tweet was sent by my account, which was not authorized by me.
``I did not miss the Tweet and he did n't delete him, ''he said in the later message.
The employees of Perry did not reply immediately to comments.
While the Tweets went to the wrong user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the former Tweet there was an unfavorable picture of the Minister of Association by Travis County, Rosemary Lauthberg, who was sentenced to the tax in April 2013.
Perry was acting as a veto against financial support for their offices when she refused to resign what could be a charge against Perry.
The text of the tweets is: ``I do not go forever with the three-fold alcohol mirror, but if I do it, I hate Governor Perry when he gets rid of it. ''
I'm the betrunkest Democracy in Texas.
Lauthberg Office was not in charge of studying the Grand jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry does not commit himself and called the charge a political trick.
His highly technical team of lawyers asked in the case of the case the judges who refused and argued that the law was held in the hands of the oldest governor in the history of the State of Texas.
Perry abolished 7.5 million dollars of government money to the Public Integration Unit of the State - determined in Travis County and, in cases of state corruption in Texas, refused to resign.
This veto resulted in a public complaint on the basis of a left-wing watch group.
Perpology official user account is often updated - and sometimes known.
After he had completed as a five during the election meetings during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry went to speculation that he was going to stop by going to a Tweet of a photos of himself in the silence near a lake, with the words ``South Carolina,!
Berkeley explains housing market again for ``normal ''
One of the most prominent architects of London pointed out that the housing market was returned to normal levels in the south-east of England.
Private homes in the capital have been hot and are the subject of enormous price rises, which the Bank of England found on the basis of widespread fear of a credit bubble, in June limits on mortgage credit.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: ``Since the start of the current financial year, the market returned to normal transaction levels since the top of 2013 and added that this is a`` stable practice environment. ''
The real estate market in London was well placed during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed to the capital.
The prices in the urban area increased by 185 percent last year, far beyond the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices rose to approximately one fifth in the past year, at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has become less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them, even through the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible `Villtax 'before the general elections in the coming May.
The London real estate broker warned in the past week that the mortgage market report for April was presented in the second half of the year in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decrease in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the housing market is cooled.
Hamptions International, a different real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in housing prices in London for 2015 after 3%, on the basis of a already weakened skin price of the skin.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Pattaya and Kensington has fallen for a quarter for a quarter of year, as far as the broker WA Ellis is concerned.
However, the desire for a home home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, because the amount of money amounts to more than 2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: ``The demand for the right product in the best locations remained stable and remained as a result.
In June, the company reported that 3.742 new homes had been sold during the year until the end of April - almost one-third more than the highest level in 2007.
The annual contract earnings rose by 40% to 280 million, the turnover of 18 percent to 1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the annual assembly of the company, Mr Pidgley told us that the revenue for Berkeley would be in the current market in the current year.
The analysts estimate that the annual pre-tax result is paid to 450 million.
In February, in London there were a number of people in London.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
More than 100 years of experience are sure to help.
Naked photos of the Osh Prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hackers who claimed to have a ``master list ''of pictures further 100 star users.
One of the members of the Stars confirmed that the photos of Shakespeare are real and complain to the hackers for ``blatant violation of privacy ''.
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who share the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos published originally on the photo gallery 4chan have supposedly been purchased by a gap in the online storage system of Apple.
It is not sure how many pictures are true, though the rest of the world has also condemned the Hack from the rest of the world.
``At those of you who look at the photos that my husband and I have taken years ago in the private environment of our house, I hope you will be happy with you
However, Victoria is one of the most important in the world.
Let's go to the beginning.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a speaker of the Popstar Ariana Grande left the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jelsons, a new novel about love and letters.
She was best described, and she was slow to get to like a cardboard that has been in the rain.
Sometimes he said unto him that he was too serious, laborious, intense, close to her, and perhaps something of scratch.
And then he left the hand.
He knew he knew.
He was stumpy, as happened in Igel.
The last victim of this bariness was a just beginning affair, which was more promising for a relief of the little bores of his life, which might even have given him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fine beauty with untold hair and a wardrobe heart from a village on the northern island, which was even even more expensive than port.
She was brought to the south with an older accompaniment to the south.
For several years, no one was living in the house.
The pipes were leck, in the bathrooms, they have still left their traces on all windows and believed that they belong to them.
It was like the house from a children story, both threatening and attractive, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jelson, his novel ``J ''on Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the next week.
In the past, she was able to give him the opportunity to meet her.
Your feet are too great.
Songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
It was not prohibited - nothing was wrong - simply did not be played.
It has successfully become obsolete, as the word is obsolete.
The general taste was created, which would never have succeeded, and as people choose in books, the Vom-Teller choose to choose millionmatic memoirs, cooking books and love of love, so they have the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kinnn began to play an imaginary piano.
Ailinn did not understand that.
``This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller, ''said he and her automatically two fingers to his lips.
That was what his father was doing to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father was played with his own father.
If you want to put a word with a J, without putting two fingers over your lips, you will have a Penny.
It was not a very funny game at that time, and it was still not very funny.
He knew that was expected to do so.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn has never been part of this.
Jazz, even if he was not directly prohibited, was not played.
What happened was not modern.
It was only a place for a single.
People wanted to be sure that they would end.
That is what the mind is.
His inpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musical in music.
Though he was 10 years old, without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kinnn knew about jazz from the half secret collection of his father.
But at least he did not have to explain that Fats Waller was black.
In her age, she probably could not remember a time in which Popssinger was not black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A coherent society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of the group.
People with afro-Caribbean origin have been suitable for entertainment and sports.
People who were originally born by the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and have been working with the task to ensure that no family remained without proper service.
What was still left by the Polish community was put in place for the canalisation, which was broken by the Greeks.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, met WAR, SAR met WAR from fear to be charged as a way of fire.
Each after its abilities.
As they have only heard ballads, Ailinn was difficult to understand, as the offensive words that the Kinnn had just sung could be more expensive.
Music was an expression of love.
``These are not really offensive, ''said Kinnn.
Perhaps for people whose feet are too great.
My father has never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
He was too much, but the neglected garden gave him the misleading sense of security.
Nothing was able to overcome the sound insulation of the giant coal leaves.
Ailinn still does not.
Why would you like to love your father?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but in its present two fingers put to the lips.
She already thought that he was somewhat strange.
``It seemed funny, ''he said instead.
You feel that you have a head of your head.
There was nothing different about the whole world than to see the uncoated rabbit of rabms.
There was nothing that he otherwise would have seen.
``When you say that you say, ''without conviction.
But that does not explain why you tell me.
She seemed to be concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He saw it once again.
Your feet do not go directly.
Maybe your buttons to have a little bit.
And you say that you hate me because my buttons are too thick?
You hate?
Of course, I do not.
That is just the stupid song.
He could have said ``I love you, ''but it was too early.
``Your thick buttons are precisely the reason why you miss me, ''trying to do it instead.
I am a bit of pervers.
That is wrong.
It had to be comical.
If he tried to be comical, he often brought himself into trouble because he did not have the reassuring Charm that he needed to hit the cruelty of cruelty.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be.
In spite of his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was born in red and came out of her deck chair.
There was no excuse for him for him.
In her passion, she seemed to catch them, as Palmwel appeared in the storm.
``and your pole head is precisely the reason why I feel you feel ye feel that`` she said them
That is not what I am.
She was tired of him, both for the unnecessary infriendliness of his words and also for the fear of his eyes when she refused to go against him.
Did she think that he would beat them?
She did not tell him about the life of the cold northern archipelago, but he had no doubt that it was essentially here.
The same huge and polluted ocean broke out here, as it was there on the banks.
The same confusing men, with even more thick skin, took WAR as their ancestors as they have been as a pig and beach robber, WAR went to pub to raise the hand against a woman who refused to commit themselves.
Is there a lot of people in the world?
These would have shown a thick mind if they did not meet!
You will only be able to jump the word for an erotic attraction between men and women.
After Kearity, this was unnecessary because it was already a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign by her body.
He rose from the deck chair as a old man.
She also felt himself, but the amount of his anger surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew.
She saw him as to how he took himself in the upper floor.
Adam leaves the garden, thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some raised their hands against them.
A man turned from her to resist his back, defeated, without fighting - why it was a sight that she seemed to know, if she could not remember a single time in which she had already seen it just before the day?
When she was alone, Ailinn Solomons looked to her feet.
Several years before the events that have just been raised, ESME has been working on a brief talk about the continued violence at low and medium-sized levels, in precisely the way in which their reduction has always been expected, in view of the money and energy that has been invested in the eradication of this violence.
``It has long been done, and much needs to be done, ''she wrote, `wrote them,`` to the feminist aggression of a people, led a thousand of wars, and gained the most of it, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness has seldom been felt.
But there are a number of features.
The higher the church tower, the smaller the passion he continues.
The people of the people who live during the hearing are aware of stories, and they are aware of the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only the former crude as well as our urban fabric are also in the hands, but are also evidence of the emergence of a new and left dispute in the workplace, in the workplace, on the streets and even on the game fields.
``You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration, ''said her mentor, when he has read the whole report.
I suggest that you read less stories.
ESME Walks cut their head to their head.
I have to ask: Are you going to be Atheist?
``I believe that I do n't have to say, ''replied ESME Hafbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Once again, ESME was calling for the right to privacy and refusal.
Feminists?
I would like to turn to silence.
``I do n't wonder, ''said Luther Rabinowitz, that's because I would be against Atheism, reading or feminism.
This is a decent job for us.
We serve a free society that is free of charge.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort the results you have presented.
They obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things that you call themselves ``empty ''and`` roh,'' could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a power and vitality of course.
If you go on to go out, the IST was executed as if it would happen if it had happened yesterday, that the country will have the essential power to live.
ESME Mount Tree saw himself, while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head he repeated a LED ad in Flamingorosa to give advice to Ofnow to the country in the last quarter.
Smile to their neighbours, tell your partner, listen to your partner, listen to ballads, visit Musicals, tell your phone, talk to your phone, tell you, tell you, listen to, listen to, vote, forgive yourself.
Talk is better than silence, the word word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
``I absolutely understand what you want, ''replied ESME What was sure she was sure that ye had to go to the end,'' and I say nothing other than that we are still not effective, as we ourselves do.
My concern is that, without prior warning, we will be able to find out how we repeat the mistakes.
This time, however, it is not the others in which we can give our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed with the hands a pyramid.
In order to indicate a Engelspatient d.
``You go too far, ''he said that if you call actions as an error, our grandparents maybe or even have not committed.
They go too far when you say that these ``anger ''and`` mistrust'' would have disappeared.
It should actually not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about understanding the past.
There was no `us' and there was no` others'.
It was a time of weakness, that is all we know.
``From when we are honest about ourselves, ESME would prefer to say that there is no part of society to be able to behave.
I hate no one.
Whether it was bad or good has happened.
That was at that time.
There is nothing more to say - and that is what we are agreed about.
And just as no fault needs to be assigned, there is also no fault to blame, if such relief would be appropriate and would be a way of tilting them.
But what does the past do if we do not learn this?
The past is that we forget them.
I would like to say something about this.
Luther Rabinowitz abandoned his pyramid.
``I will remember her report, ''he said.
The next day, when she went to work, she was beaten by a motorcycle driver, who, as he described, was in a kind of ``brutal anger. ''
There are cases.
Lesotho-military member says that no coup was planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Official representatives of the military began to have a coup to the collapse of the government and said that they went against police officers who are accused of military fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and admitted that the army of the country occupied its office of office.
The Premier brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa when he reported about terrorist threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup, that the military was acting on the threat by the police of the police.
``What was happening this morning was that the head of the defence forces was in the police, after having received several secret service reports in the police that there are a number of elements within the police that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party political young fanatics, who are still suffering from war, ''said he against Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action made the impression of a crash.
``even if no one has claimed the government to be thrown away by violence, all the reports agree on the fact that the activities of the defense forces of Djibouti show signs of a coup d'état, ''said he said.
Speakers from the military of Ramallah passed on Sunday with the soldiers to go back in their homes and be able to stay in the capital.
In the meantime, the Deputy Minister of Mothetjoya takes over the government during Thabane absence.
Thabane told that he believes that he was founded on the basis of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
Since June, there have been great tension since June when Thabane parliamentary meetings took place on the basis of the dispute in its uniform government.
He said that his actions would have failed to undermine the government.
Production in the eurozone
The rise in production in the eurozone slowed down in August to the lowest point of the last 13 months.
In August, the final Markite shopping directory fell to 50.7 in August, after a booth of 51.8 in July.
An indication about 50 adds to expansion.
New orders went back and experienced factories in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures meet the meeting of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- on Thursday.
The markets expect a clear plan for dealing with a reluctant recovery of the eurozone, as well as threatening deflation at a rate of inflation.
There are speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information in the course of this week whether it would consider quantitative easing for the eurozone, in accordance with those carried out by the UK and the United States during the financial crisis.
``Although a small growth is better than not growth, the slow effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for the manufacturers have become clearer, ''said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The Fabrik-PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner in Russia in the EU, fell to 51.4 with 51.4.
In the meantime, the most important economic nation in the block, France, PMI fell to 46,9.
France remains a landlord, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence of the fact that growth incentives are no longer used in key industrial derivatives in Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are also not reassuring, as Mr Dobson said.
The drop in industry is probably the fire of analysts that expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Sisko, chief economic expert at IHS Global, said: ``The best thing is to keep the sector going to grow.
It added: `producers in the eurozone obviously find life difficult to achieve, given that the current geopolitical tensions are increasing - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - uncertainties in the difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and presumably leads to the fact that some orders are delayed or cancelled, especially in large orders.
He said that ``it would become more and more likely to call for the ECB to initiate a kind of QE, even though we suspect that this will be limited. ''
The survivors of Beslan died: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children themselves are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people of Chechen militias were taken hostage in a school in Beslan.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, have been killed.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims.
Exactly one decade after the appalling siege of the school of Beslan, with the 334 people, the heroic survivors died last night before a new Apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatical Islamist terrorists and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disrepute, and turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell is going to follow them.
Your biggest hope?
An end to the war that Ukraine is now dying.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb back removed.
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer.
Aida was totally confused after her mother Larissa, 40 years ago.
Both were kept dead, but they survived.
``A woman told me, I was going to race my life, but I could not, `said Aida at the time.
My legs were overflowing.
I stood on and went out to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them to security.
After a series of operations, she was completely cured, but yesterday, three months ago, the pain returned.
I fear that I will have to operate again.
Some granals are still in my knees.
Your aim is to become patient, in order to help people.
``This tragedy changed my life, but it did not destroy me, ''she says.
That is what I have happened, and that can not be changed
Once in the year I am always in the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try to talk to others.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future class of Sisera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small.
``I do n't want to marry until I start studying my career.
On a family I think later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, though the memory of each year will become somewhat weak.
I am glad that many people in the world remember our horror, and we are grateful for the help that we have received from people to the UK.
If I look at the photo of me as I return to the school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help us not happen again.
The boy who fled through the balloon, believe that his mother was dead
It was his first school day -LRB- Russians go to school for 7 years -RRB-.
As a seven-year, he said: ``I told me that I should put myself when there was an explosion.
After an explosion he thought she would die.
She said to him: ``Run.
Full of fear, she could be dead, and saw on the path of a small child, took it in hand and fled by a ball hagel.
His father Vladimir, who joined his son outside, said: ``Damir told me that his mother died.
He said: `I could not save them.
In fact, Tamara was on the outside and in the hospital, in fact, in the assumption that her son was turned.
After their reunification, she said: ``I dream about joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran out and turned me to me.
Damir later went to London -LRB- from the now opened newspaper News of the World -RRB- to get the title of a Barnardo's Children 'Champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
``This horror is followed by you every day, but I wish I could stop by remembering that he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is in my memory.
I know that I directly took up my toy gun.
But now I'm able to play computer games and that is not a problem for me.
``I'm not afraid to go to the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, whom I have played in the courtyard.
We never say that they have been killed or dead.
We say that they are in the sports hall.
I remember very well about my journey to London, especially on the toys, where I was able to choose what I wanted.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of disaster that he and his friends have suffered.
This horror is followed every day, but I wish I could stop to remember that.
``I'm sorry about all those who are suffering from the dolphins, ''said Damir, who worked in a monastery last week.
I would like to help.
I want to go to the police a day and I hope that she will take me next year in the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: ``37 children from our neighbourhood have been killed, that you can imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was simply no children who were able to go, and this silence took many months.
She remembers her journey to London with Damir.
The people in London, when I told our story.
I understood how people can understand our feelings on the other side of the world.
She was grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie, and you just say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting to her and to her husband in London, as the Damir helped.
I remember how Damir would like to eat Borsh and call them all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played in a restaurant.
And that was just one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British shared our pain and supported us.
She said: `I always think that this world has not become better in these ten years.
The war is now going on in Ukraine, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killed.
That is exactly what we have.
I think that for many of the war there is a part of the news they hear when they are bored or with something other than others.
I just know what these people feel.
And I ca n't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people want to kill each other and that is sad.
Damir was great and it is a very quiet and quiet boy, he is neither aggressive or angry.
He does not look for revenge, he is not overthrown by the past Greuules.
I know that he does n't like to remember that, but he has six close friends from the class and they go occasionally in the sports hall and they destroy the candles.
When he was smaller, he suffered.
His eyes were open.
I would also like to remind myself how he did all his weapons and other military games.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure that he was dead, that he would never see him.
When I came to the legs, I saw the hell to share me.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell was able to survive.
``I remember that I took him to him,`` Damir, run away, ''but I was also sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he went away.
And so the life, unlike the many of others, go to us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The Young, the terrible image after the siege to the symbol of the Greuel of Beslan
Convenience: The Beslan-overlive Georgij Lyin with his mother Höma after the siege of 2004, on the right of a picture of Georgij today
His blooded face was painted by fear when he was able to live his life.
His image was one of the shocking symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Höma, 54, had him for his first school day before she was in vain to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
``I left the courtyard for about two minutes before the terrorists went to him, and thus my little boy stayed for three terrible days, ''she remembers.
Not only was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer to this date, the more serious it is to think and talk about it.
There is no single day to which we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it is long, I think it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days are following me forever.
Nobody will forget that, and that is what I promise.
Finally, the image of Georgij -LRB- the left -RRB- was one of the most shocking of the attack and was dismissed as a statue -LRB- right -RRB-.
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school this day.
I knew that he was in life when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the vineyard in San Marino.
Georgij does not want to see the picture, and it is hidden in our book.
I understand that, but I also believe that the people of the world feel our pain.
Georgij says today: ``It is important that this can never happen again.
``I doubt that we ever learn the truth.
People always investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they investigate the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it has caused?
This world is becoming something of horror.
``I can not understand how that is possible
For ten years, there is nothing to do with the pain.
We need dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a couple of times because of the siege, but then it became better.
I went back to school in 2004 and feared every day.
I thought to my friends and class players who were killed.
That's why I come to the sports hall when the 1st September moves closer.
I would like to pay tribute to my old child.
It is hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I do not feel as victims, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I am not.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visit a medical school in Wínkawkaz.
I will become heart chirurg.
My first choice was education in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that did not happen.
Georgij Faniev, 20.
The Young, though he was caught on the feet of a murderous terrorist was caught.
A miracle: Georgij Faniev was caught during the siege on the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was caught in the sports hall.
It is really a miracle that he was not killed.
``We feel as if it would have been yesterday, ''says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB, because of his health damage.
It is still with me, it is not what I have left behind me.
I'm older and people say that children can easily handle serious experiences - I have to say, but that is true.
``In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I really felt a bit better, but I can not forget it
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - this was the first and only time that I went to the sports hall.
I lost the awareness.
I will never go back again and ask me not to show you where I have been sitting in this famous picture.
Sown: Georgij Faniev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is immense and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do n't like to talk about it and they never asked about school.
Physically, it is good to me.
I should be careful about my injured age, but I can now run well.
But because of my health, I was not able to study the secret service academy of the FSB in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have sent my documents, the medical sent and they have replied that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have had two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals ''from cats to calves.
He said: ``I knew that I never wanted to report to my children.
Children should not know anything and they should not.
His mother Marina, 42, said: ``This pain leaves me never.
He is in my soul worse when the anniversary moves closer.
I am going to go to the celebrations.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It has to be much more intense because it was there.
I waited home to him and was unable to help.
I am grateful to God for being returned to me.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now a adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that if something is met.
He is a boy, he like sport, but he can not participate on his knees
He has been operating on several occasions, it can run, but there will be no sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you never forget that.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbours have been killed during the siege, and that only strengthens my pain.
I have lost many people who I knew very much.
My son is in me, and that is the greatest gift that God was able to make me, but my heart of the wine is about the rice.
I know of families in which new children have been born.
It is difficult to accept that life continues, even if that does not want.
I will never forget my heart in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can not believe that
We have been a friendly country in the past, as can be that we are now fighting?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and are still being killed.
As far as we are concerned, if all of these are going to go, it will be possible to go as far as possible.
Aljona Tskönwa, 10.
The baby that was taken care of by a special assignment in security
Save: Aljona Tskönwa is brought to security by a Russian special acting party -LRB- left -RRB-.
She is now ten -LRB- right -RRB- and does not remember the atrocities.
The world took the breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was born in the poor of Russian police.
The terrorists let them go, but held in their cruelty their 30-year mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, at the time there were three years old, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous mixed.
Her father, Ruslan, has once again been secret since then and has a small girl with his new wife, a little girl that he was named after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today, does not remember the siege and has grown to an intelligent and happy girl.
``You are now a great family and Aljona and Makhar, are the two great children,`` says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save all the memories raised by the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused girls on a pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on a pedestrian road in Fife because of the remediation of a three-year girl.
Gordon Steward is accused of having a girl in East Neuk in East Neuk.
The charge is that Mr. Steward has controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and violated the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, put the suspect before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair supplied the procedure for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos.
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most expensive option is a water density Point And-Shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a Action-Cam as the GoPro heroin 3 + Silver Edition, which are both for about 300.
I have added these photos to a family with several cameras that are available for a price of less than 350.
Irrespective of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a water density camera, you will be sure to have the battery.
Place your camera on the photos or videos that you want to start.
A number of cameras and cameras have been optimized for the background of the exposure time.
And before you jump, check what depth of your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and ratings for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Make multiple pictures - because many are not.
Reference cameras have an LCD that allows you to create images.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to look at this.
So make a lot of pictures.
When your camera has a friction mode, you can use it with a series of recordings with slightly modified exposure settings.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is dramatically worse, as long as you remove yourself from the surface.
If possible, you will stay close to the surface if you make pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
It is also a good Council, but it is all the more important for the poor light conditions.
It is especially important if you work with a Action-Cam: These devices often have a fixed wide angle, which means that you have to go to your objects when filling out the whole image wire.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in a gigantic organization like the NHS.
He devoted his career to the patient to avoid the disease.
Under his patient, his wife was a MI6-employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important to the diagnosis and diseases, while the treatment is mainly dealt with with something quite different: Pain.
One day in 2007 he was the one whose head began.
``I did not feel me, ''he wrote in May this year.
I have had difficulties to get rid of me.
While he fought with the grippelike symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Juliet impatiently.
``I want to know everything immediately than later.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unlucky and without reason concerned.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his breast.
It was only two weeks ago that he was in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was taken.
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an explosive cancer that attacks the cings to the skin.
As with most cancers, the precise trigger is usually hard to determine.
For example, a few smokers of lung cancer have not been ill.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asynchronous load - contact with the fiber tree, which was once recognized as deadly.
For the majority of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos is ultimately a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has no longer been used in the UK since the 1960s when the industry has voluntarily committed itself to using them.
Also, where he was still employed, only people worked directly with the substance - plumbers, construction workers, rooms and advertising workers for instance.
As an industrial hazardous material from a different time, it seems to me to be a cause for concern.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, today is the highlight of a Mesolonic epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die on this disease as traffic accidents.
Annual figures of the Mesotheliomtodesy since 1980, in the aftermath of future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years -LRB- in 1999 -RRB-, it is that a Mesotheliom is only being developed for decades.
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and often still, in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we are learning and shopping.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial boundaries, jobs or age.
The privileged Bastions, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are not a protective room.
The parliamentary buildings have been contaminated.
Even in the hospitals, in which we are going to be healthy, there has already been a result of the legacy of this deadly massacre.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also no plumber.
It was indeed difficult to imagine where he might have been able to contact asbestos.
Then he found it.
``It looks as if there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels when I graduated for six years.
All - students, nurses, doctors, and Pförtner - use the tunnel.
One wonders how many people are suffering from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
``From the four doctors who have been trained in the Guy's Hospital, and the last five years of Mesotheliom, ''he wrote in a letter,`` I'm the last who is still living.''
How many of what are we going to do?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed in the age of 48 years.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty per cent die within 8 months after the diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore only repeat the question of Lawson: `how many of what are we going to do? '
The leading expert of the UK for Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto takes the view that, between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to end, 950,000 of the disease will be lost.
Most of these still have no idea that they will die.
An asynchronous mine in Quebec, Canada
A short look at the files of the dishes to which the people concerned are often looking for damages show how far the scourge of the Mesothelioms is already spread.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, have been exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years ago when she started her business at M & S.
Now she has two children in the vicinity.
``This is what she says,`` I never heard of Mesotheliom, but I did n't really know something about asbestos.
I would never have thought that this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the concept of asbestos does not include a substance but a group of six minerals.
The name of the word comes to a description of the fibre structure, which makes the material resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is now far from the most frequently found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe insulation, wall insulation, and even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other asthma forms, but it is regarded as a ``big health risk ''by the EU and the WHO.
However, the most dangerous is the brown asbestos and the blue asbestos -LRB- Krokydolith -RRB-.
Britain was once the world's largest importer, and experts suspect that ``it was clear, but indirect evidence suggests that this was a main reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomrats. ''
A staff of Marks & Spencer was held in the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, asbestos.
Janice Allen has perhaps not seen himself as a typical Mesotheliomage, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their history is far from unusual.
He has put forward a study of the people affected, showing that ``a significant proportion of the Mesotheliome has been caused by the environment.
A large proportion of these contacts are based on the ``normal use and aging ''of our buildings.
It looks as if no one can expect to be sure.
A report by Captain Consulting, who studied the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance in the hearts of the government.
In 2009, he reported that the services were contaminated with asbestos behind the committees of Parliament.
Members of Parliament are often accused of dealing with their own interests, but that is where the opposite is true.
While the management of the Parliamentary Employment Service insisted that the Western National Palace has received a ``clean health certificate '', it is now no doubt that 1 billion of work needs to be spent over several years to modernise Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos.
The Aporian report also pointed out that `the presence of asbestos was not carried out in accordance with the respective provisions.
Nobody can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
All we can do is to wait.
A person who has never been able to understand the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, he claims that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
``I worked in a hospital, it was decided to be positive, ''but I ca n't prove it in my case.
It is difficult to remember all the places in which you have worked.
As far as he is concerned, the day is early December 2009, in which he got a kind of fever.
He was 45, and just late in the evening he had a surgery.
Suddenly, I had the courage to hide.
It was suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I believed that the journey will no longer be created.
As a doctor Abbott knew that the pain of the breast, the skin came up around his cings.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect.
He did not work for a month.
Doctors made X-ray recordings of his breast, and Pleurakathether to test liquid from the cings, and testing in the laboratory.
But his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved, and he returned to his job.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned to life, often according to sporting activity.
In 2011, a patient was diagnosed with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesotheliom.
But as far as it is concerned, it does not work with his own case.
After all, his patient has been older and has worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbotts deteriorated and his owner brought to a group of users.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time was introduced with a camera in the cave between the reefs and the breast.
I am an optimist.
Mostly, I say he says.
To be honest, I did not have so many concerns.
But Rachel, my wife, was concerned.
The result of the biotechnology was in the week between Christmas and New Year: ``You told me that it was Mesotheliom.
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had dates with Macmillan-nurses, who recommended him to take a lawyer.
First, it is the scale of the epidemic.
``It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings, where pipes were often isolated with asbestos. ''
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings now fall.
And thus Mesotheliom meets younger people who did not work in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes in hospitals in hospitals under the earth, therefore, patients have probably not been exposed to the substance.
But many employees who would like to change from one building to another -LRB- like Andrew Lawson -RRB- or in underground cantines -LRB- as it often did -RRB-, came with the greatest probability in contact with the toxic substances.
It shows that, over several decades, hospitals could have been life-saving for patients.
It is still being removed today.
Students raised their Bunsenburning on the end of the company.
And it does not just affect hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and cities.
Also schools.
Indeed, many people have probably had the first asthma contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemical patients, students have left their Bunsenburning on asbestos.
On web pages, the subject of asbestos is often raised in schools.
And meanwhile, as innocent items are included in our homes such as floor plates or shoppendrooms by the use of asbestos.
``It is a industrialist that is included in large parts of our properties, ''commented Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his process against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact taken by a woman concerned was in the 1970s.
Therefore, as you want, you will be able to turn your clothes.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is fatal is immense.
``It takes a while to process, ''says Graham Abbott.
I went to work and tried to do further, but I noticed that I could not focus on what I did.
I was in practice two weeks.
Then I knew that I had to deal with myself.
Yes, I'm not going to experience Christmas.
The greatest difficulty was to change the perspectives from the position of a physician.
As many patients reminded him, he reminded himself of the way in which he was able to meet from all the information he had to meet.
``It was very difficult to include everything, ''says he.
``I asked my doctor how long I have? '
And there were about 12 months.
I remember that I thought that I will not experience another Christmas.
That was what happened.
Mesotheliom is especially popular because it is our life treatment mechanism - the breathing itself - that the deadly cancer is caused.
The majority cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asthma.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is captured and the fibres are used, they can be placed in the breast.
Asthma fibres confuse the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations.
``The problem is caused by the ingredients used in the body, with the same name as Professor Tom Treasure, a heart Thorax-physician who changed to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
It is precisely the hospital that Andrew Lawson claims that it is exposed to asbestos.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training.
As soon as the asthma tissue reaches the lung tissue, rulers say that they are pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From the very beginning, it is from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancers do not work in Mesotheliom.
For instance, the effectiveness of a surgery is hot.
Some believe that they are worth trying.
It is the only thing that unites the people of the world.
``He can not cut the breast skin, ''it says
They do not come with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer does not talk very well to chemotherapy.
``sometimes there are long-term overliving, ''says Treasure.
But at the end all of them die.
Fortunately, some patients are actually living long, much longer than that.
The author of Stephen Newton died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott was in contact with Andrew Lawson, the four years after his diagnosis.
``hello, cancer, ''said that he was happy to meet.
``He was very positive, ''says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott was offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would only be extended by a month.
``I was desperate, ''he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to show things in a rather positive light.
After the advice of several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazyelski.
``We had an advantage that I had to quote.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is essential for test patients in order to be able to perform the best available therapies.
But if these treatments fail to fail, many are concerned about the future of the families that leave them.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field LEASING Waterhouse LLP.
``It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health, ''says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that you realized that a health risk was also very low.
And here the negligence of companies began to play.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually found their case, but it was not what Morgan called for full compensation, ''Lawson was unable to prove absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom was due to the use of the guy.
After the investigation to his death, a speaker of the guy 'confirmed that ``the asbestos fibres have been removed in the cellar area in the 1990s. ''
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is a huge problem that leads to compensation.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that time is for them.
As a response to this, there were significant new legislation in this year that makes it easier to collect compensation, even if their previous employers are no longer.
The law has acquired a fund sponsored by the insurance industry from 350 million to all that was diagnosed after July 2012.
In these cases, the plaintiff will receive 80% of what a court could have been able to talk about them - about 120,000.
About 300 successful applications in the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks that 350 million people are living in the insurance industry for 350 million.
``This is a deal of insurance for insurers, ''says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers have had to pay, if the time would have to fail and would be able to keep the company normal to the company.
Mike also said that the law was not perfect.
But, like Morgan, it is necessary to carry out rapid action every day in the face of seven deaths.
``The people are suffering so much and today need help, ''said Peing during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazyelski for 19 months.
After its first consultations, Lang-Lazyelski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation treatment and chemotherapy.
Abbott felt strengthened.
``This is of course the most important, ''says Abbott.
That is what patients see.
There is something about what you are going to go on.
If you look at you, it's very fast.
Graham Abbott went to the surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August he went to the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
In the past, there were no signs of the disease.
Then, in March 2014, I had a scan.
There have been several cancers around my breast.
I was just going to 50.
That is not sustainable.
That is what is happening.
Once again, Abbott moved to six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no trace of the tumors.
But the process is physically and mentally very demanding.
You have to think about practical things - about the money if I'm no longer, for example.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
They have to look to the future.
As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
``He is difficult to say, ''says he.
It is hard to know what one is going to say.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I would have a disease with which I would not be old.
They reacted differently.
Tamsin is very close to you.
She told her friends and we soon got very many calls.
Ellie was cautious.
She did not say much.
Such discussions are something that needs to be carried out by all cancer patients.
However, such talks are not surrounded by hope, not from a track of hope to survival.
The disease -LRB- as was ultimately the case for Stephen Newton -RRB- will bring about a high level of security.
As Andrew Morgan says, ``Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

A compensation programme of 350 million will be announced.
Asbestos is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos will continue to be used in many countries of the world.
Worldwide production is about 2 million tonnes per year.
China is refusing Hong Kong law on government elections, demonstrators
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided against democratic reform against the nomination of candidates for the elections by Hong Kong.
This procedure was probably announcing the protests in Hong Kong for the long time, while activists are in the process of planning and mobilising within a few hours.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders to be able to reject all non-pekingloyal candidates.
``This does not happen unexpectedly, but it does make us angry, ''said the legal expert of Lars y Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing promised.
There were the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In its defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice president of the Standing Committee of the National People Congress, said that the approval of public nominations would be chaotic in the elections for the Hong Kong Government.
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to elect the residents from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, but the decision makes it clear that the Chinese leadership retains the process through a nominal nomination committee controlled by Beijing.
After a new clause, only candidates are to be admitted with love for the country and love of Hong Kong.
The decision follows a summer, in which some of the largest and ad hoc protests took place in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the movement of Occupy Central is in favour of Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to escape the financial district, if Beijing does not allow any real general vote.
On Sunday evening, within a few hours after the announcement, hundreds were gathered in Hong Kong about the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
In the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement reached a new level civilian disorder and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
But they have failed to prevent problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers shared that the movement of ``the occupation of the Central District has only been considered as the last resort, an action that should only take place when all dialogue options are exhausted and does not have any other choice.
We are sorry to say that all the dialogue has been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for the announcement of Beijing for the past days, and they were held on Sunday before the government building.
The riots are reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their town.
The movement of people from the mainland strengthens the competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear that the values of Hong Kong like democracy and free speech begin under the growing pressure of Beijing are beginning.
Some of them criticised the demonstrations of the occupation of the occupation because they are dangerous to business - the life of Hong Kong.
``The protests they are talking about may cause great economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long they continue, ''said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
There are no fears about Hong Kong.
That impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media in China recently reported about the democratic activists in Hong Kong than by Western powers.
In this summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on electoral rights in excess than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in the history of the region.
The tradition of school disputes in the United States is now transmitted to universities, where they are offered by private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transportation prices such as private aircraft, helicopter.
Mr Stewart also admitted that the service had a security problem.
This service is an ideal alternative for students.
Together with our new VIF-options we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A corporate speaker said that no new reservation was added, because the service was only just introduced, but added that ``students would book the service in the next weeks.
The company also admitted that there is a market for this offer.
Students today distinguish between their expectations and the demands of students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it's important for you to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can exactly do that.
However, the National student union criticised the Service.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for higher education, said: ``This offer seems to be totally separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start this month by studying are faced with a crisis of life costs because the available financial assistance in the form of credits and grants does not keep with the heavily rising invoices for the easiest conditions of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something less than the arrival in the student residence.
Feminists criticise racial matters and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenagers were killed by police officers in Ferguson at the beginning of this month.
The participants raised their hands in the air and in the hands, ``hands high, not shooting,`` while they were waiting for the fruit.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mon, because of the killing of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the Bloger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change to the online discussion white feminists.
After their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequality.
While the tensions in the Middle West, however, grew and respected throughout the country, Perez saw the answers of white women to 100% of the race.
In comparison with the answers black women, shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as ``thoughts about Ferguson by a white woman ''turned to the oppression of women relatively late.
But for Perez this was an important change.
``I do not believe that one finds many people who speak about the white.
People felt themselves to be able to express themselves.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are, because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnically that they have to express that.
Ferguson has brought Ferguson to the light in the cultural area, for English professors from the Ohio State University, on the issues of light that are exposed to black American players.
``I can publish something on Facebook about me and my partner will publish and get 150 likes of all of them, ''said Mitchell.
If I have something about how Farses are under siege in their own country, the silence is empty.
``How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship? ''she wondered.
For black women like Mitchell, the race, gender, and sexuality, there is no poet between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the themes; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hlasty, Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mason University say that their predecessors did the opposite.
``There were at least 10,000 black men and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman, ''said Hlasty.
White women had to be involved in history.
For Hlasty, the division between white and black women came to the point, with the white fighters in the country in the late years of the 19th century, demonstrating that the battle for the right to vote could only be successful for each group: Women or Black.
``You met the decision to stand up for female representation, and the right to vote for black should come later, ''said Hlasty.
If you remember such things, you will realise why coloured women do not trust white women.
We have not done our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote, there was still a decade to which white women organized against the sperm in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was born almost 40 years after the original request for the help of pages of black women.
For Mitchell is the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - a mirror of time, in which white feminists played with the problems with which black women have been affected by generations.
``It would not be great if the activist activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to the education of a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception. ''
Feminists of the second generation trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist took part two weeks after the discovery of Michael Brown on Facebook and published an important article by Rebecca Carroll, the slogan of the Guardian, in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on racism.
``I hope that women, who have another, have the danger of understanding the body.
Though Stein is in the field of more intersectional feminism, just like gender issues, some of their comments about the race in America are still being confused.
Cristina Summer, research director of the American Enterprise Institute and author of the People's Republic said to the People that young men in the United States, in particular as their sisters, ``but Steinems comments to Ferguson in contrast to their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, put in to help the most vulnerable young black and tribal men, gave it great reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem.
When the US border police took up almost 63,000 unattended minors on the southern coast of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is once again on the surface - this time as a female.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong, a organization that mobilised women for immigration reform, said that she would simply publish the stories of immigrant women.
``These speak for themselves, ''said Mercado.
If the vast majority of labor visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
``These stories can be found in the women's women, ''said she.
The ``pig house ''in Ipswich is available for sale.
The image of a house of sale was removed as shown clearly, that there was a lot of pigs that was comfortable in the living room.
The free house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000.
To the details there was a picture of the living room of the house - with one of them that had his head on a sofa.
Real estate broker Connell said that the pig was the pet of the owner.
``The photo was accidentally published, and it was now`` said ''a speaker of the company.
In the portrait of the house, Connell described the former as a ``unique family house with a bedroom. ''
While the broker has removed the image from the site, it appears on advertising material.
In the social media, domestic sales have been interested in interest in the social media than some wondered whether the pig would be included in the purchase price.
The SWCity is a new millionaire for pilots.
A pilot player from Milton is this month.
The search for a new millionaire takes place in the southwest of Scotland, with a happy winner who receives almost 1.1 million from the pilot on Saturday.
For the second time, for the second time, the jackpot took the jackpot in the drawing of the first division, after 1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner needs to be informed.
The shop owner Steve said that the profit care for talk material in the small town in the southwest of Kiev.
The city speaks of nothing, and all are pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could happen.
Last month, eight WA-winners took advantage in the first division, for a few happy weeks for the players in the State.
Last week, a player from Canning Alto became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple of weeks from Belmont only a few weeks ago the meggains of 7.5 million.
The winning couple had been played for twenty years, and the profit will give them the opportunity for a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in Seychelles in this year, with a total of almost 85 million.
Leonidas
Not only the granators were wet in Matsch at the first Rhine at the first end of the Rhine, in the area of the park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract yesterday as far as 1000 visitors.
There have been a colourful friction of illustrations, performances, games, exhibitions, and information about the times of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was certainly the martilian fighter of the Stone School of Amor Mortis that took out any rain break to demonstrate its robust combat art.
``Leonidas ''proved to be a mystery and expert presentation, sending his men into the ring for the heroic class.
First of all, the ``Provocators ''have been on the right arm on the left hand.
It was followed by the ``Esedarii ''with a chest of chest, short legs, and flaps.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the ``Pas arius, ''which took place against the`` Secutor,'' and recently fought the Burschen on the ground.
As a result, the heavy metals in the sky were filled up by the arena that there could be a fear and a bange to get the health of the flower.
But on that, the imposing ``Summa Rudis, ''was always an eye of attention.
``We wanted to revive the Roman daily routine and to experience the culture of the Roman era, ''explained Chelsea Euskirchen, Chairman of the organizer of`` Friends of Roman Channel,'' the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparatory time, the park was used for one day a ``Oppibel Roman, ''a Roman town such as Vice President of the Lord, in his welcome word.
After all, the Romans have not just brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we admire today.
The remains of these were also admired at the Roman day, for example, ``Aquoco marble ''from the eleven high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridge, which was once at the end of the city.
The troika society was once and now faced with the water and energy supply, and now she knew: ``We are still making use of the knowledge from that time.
This has also been confirmed by the Bachelor of Excellence by the ``Engineering Team Two ''from Rheinbach, by the Romans, as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented the exhibits and models of the excavations, as well as bricks made from the original hypotruest, the hot air juice that was once the Roman villa.
There were also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two years ago in the footings before they were turned out.
In 2011, the office for floor buildings had the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park of North in Rheinbach.
You have found a division of an economic building with a Darre for drying from cereals and to the Mälzen.
The building has probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural commodity.
A series of sites from these excavations took them in a glass of fruits, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate halace.
The Villa has probably existed from the first to the fourth century, until the fall of the Germanen in the early Roman Rhine.
In their work, the children are also with the Roman wind of wind, in the same way that the Roman students wrote their names.
At the stand of the Roman thermal baths, the children could have themselves finding themselves at the stand of the glass museum of Rheinbach glass mosaic, and at the stand of the natural center of Eifel Nettersheim to use a heavy wheat mill from stone to show the flour for a floppy or a cereals.
With the old town of Rome, the visitors went through the park and returned to the impressive booth of the city.
With a Roman week from 13th to 21 September, the municipality of Lentberg will also present itself to the Rhine region in 2014 to remember the death of Emperor Prince 2000 years ago.
Together with the home history and historical history, Oberbachem will be able to remind you about the history of the city.
For example, a Roman legionist of his work will tell us about his work on the farm, presenting plants from the Roman era and finding a funny lesson in the field of international understanding.
Within the framework of a project, the primary school of the city is devoted to the Roman theme.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, but often not more visible traces will be made possible by the Romans in Wachtberg.
A small presentation will be remembered to the Fund of the Bercumer Matronenheiisch of the Bercumer Matron.
Emerola: The epidemic of Western Africa
The Ebola-epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are being orphaned - and international companies go to distance.
The devastating Ebola-epidemic is a serious blow to the economy of Western Africa.
The harvest rotates on the fields, the mines are left and the markets were orphaned - the virus has made the region difficult.
There are also a number of international companies that go to distance.
``The Ebola-epidemic is not just a medical crisis, but also an economic, ''
Liberia on the hardest
``It is a total disaster, we lose very much money, ''says Alhaji Bamogo, who sold on the second largest market in Liberias capital Monrovia clothing.
On the market, only those who want to buy foods want to buy.
Liberia was hit hardest by the virus, and the fever fell more than 600 people.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease was put in place in every corner of the country.
The virus was also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people, thousands of others, died.
Foreign companies prefer employees out of business.
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies rely on their operations.
Foreign companies such as the Steel Group of Arcelor Mittal prefer their employees to fly several international airlines.
The local traders and farmers are also reacting: Only a few of them are leaving their home sites to try out.
In a number of areas in Sierra Leone, Liberia, which are under quarantine, are being wiped out among others for the export of important cocoa and coffee beans on the fields.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes.
Food
``The people are always going to travel, ''says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of Western Africa.
The man, for instance, who normally goes to the market and sells its vegetables, would rather be able to stay.
The population will therefore feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: Food is scarce.
On the markets, stocks of basic foodstuffs such as rice are being destroyed.
At the same time, the region heavily affected by international companies is a kind of image, with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time.
It is crucial how far the virus is spread and how long the virus is going to spread.
In the event of investors, the impression is that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia
The disease is also burdened by the harsh state budgets in the Member States.
The disease also affects the states that have already been affected.
The rating agency's rating agency fears that their budgets are heavily dealt with by the high spending on the health system and in addition to the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars -LRB- 45 million euros -RRB-.
The effects are also reflected in Nigeria, where there have been only a few EIB cases.
The oil-rich region in southern Niger has not been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are afraid of fear of contagion.
Reservations are also clearly returned in hotels.
Defend their 50th anniversary
Berngau was founded on April 12 until 14 September.
The preparations for the 50-year foundation will take place from 12 to 14 September.
The event is planned on Friday, 12 September.
On Saturday there will be a lot of Bon.
After that, in the great place of the evening, there is also the ``Stoapbezer. ''
The guitar is made for the music.
Highlights on the Sunday will be at 14 p.m. in the parish church on Sunday.
In the afternoon there is also the price distribution of the federal and Gauber.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 in front of her.
The band of Berngau is the band of the band.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State have taken over the association.
The original name was founded in 1907 when the ``social entertainment ''was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime has led 1937 to the dissolution of the association.
There are still 19 young men in 1964 who, on 30 April, took up the ``new`` Rebenwald ''of Berngau.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club by a difficult starting time, in the first time in which it went mainly to find a club and install the shooting operation.
As early as the autumn in 1965, the patron started with two teams to compete with two teams.
In the following years the sports protected, which was meanwhile organized in seven teams in all classes.
For the first time, it was reached by Jeff Meier for the first time in 1980.
As the performance of active attention has increased, the number of members has also been positively developed.
After having been able to meet the demands of a modern protectorate, the company of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future residence in the cellar rooms of the new ``Landgasthof hardness. ''
After a working performance of 2700 hours on 8 May in 1988, Napoleon raised the church blessing.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaushoot.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 celebrated its 30-year anniversary of the foundation.
A Bon group was founded in 1995.
Josef Randzl was referred to Bon.
A great challenge for the ``Bon ''and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Bon meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the United Nations have modernised the rooms last year and brought about the latest technology.
Eleven teams in Render Race
You can also see the sports services of the Protect Association.
As a whole, there are currently eleven teams in the past: Six airguns teams, an air gun team, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Catherine Ellrich, Steffi degrees and Kerller Keller grew up 1 in the course of 2013 in the course of 2013.
The 2nd team with Armstrong Krasburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Shomann and Tobias Graml grew up by the Gauk League in the Gauster League.
In addition to the shooting sport, you will have events such as Bockfer, carnival and royal football.
In this respect, they are also among the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffered accident in return to the race.
Tony Stewarts return to the circuit ended by its race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went to the wall for the second time after his right to meet in round 172 ended.
Stewart went to the garage and left it without talking about journalists.
His team was told to be disappointed, his 14-inch team was disappointed, but the race will focus on the race for the next weekend.

The army also admitted that seven soldiers were killed in the past 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has previously announced human consequences in the battle against the separatists, without calling details.

NATO does not want agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia through the Ukrainian crisis as a result of the Ukrainian crisis.
NATO Secretary General Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is in the founding agreement of the NATO Convention of NATO in 1997.
The NATO leader, however, accused of Russia ``a sharp attack of the deal. ''
``Today we have to look to the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner
From documents and opinions by the Russian side, ``that they consider us as an opponent.
Increasing NATO
Mr Rasmussen has also announced that the NATO presence in Eastern Europe should be strengthened.

Kiev and Moscow

Merkel speaks of power: Toll will be ``clear ''
Now the Chancellor is aware of this.
But there is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The conservative concerns from the CDU against the car toll toll have become much more powerful.
Chancellor Angela Merkel talked about a power word for the introduction of a car toll toll.
``To tell you clearly: You are in the coalition agreement, and she will come, ''the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU-top committees in Berlin.
On a detailed model, however, Merkel failed.
Certain parameters have been referred to in the black-red government programme.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt -LRB- Christian Democrats -RRB- has made a proposal and will continue to work.
However, the Cold League insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel also stressed the advice for a bill in the discussions on a draft bill.
In addition to the theme, he has also spoken about further opportunities to enable more private capital for investment in infrastructure.
``There was nothing special about this, ''says a`` mirror'' report on Sunday, his house reviewed its own concept to pay for motorway investors with toll revenue - after the election of 2017.
It was then warned about developing toll concepts against the responsible minister.
CDU-edge vize Armin reaffirmed his objections.
``The coalition contract never went out of it, said all the cross and federal roads that said that the North American CDUland leader said.
In this respect, it is an important signal that hake has now announced to talk about the subject.
Resistance to the plans is also caused by the CDUland associations of Baden-Württemberg and the Rhineland.
The background is that there is a limit to small border traffic in neighbouring countries.
Hake was required because of the toll criticism from the head of the CDU coalition.
The Left failed to have plans in the face of the dispute in the Union.
``The Murks-toll is dead, ''said the leader of Bernd Riexinger of the`` New Zealand newspaper'' -LRB- Monday -RRB-.
``With the toll, the Minister`` Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette on all German roads that is supposed to start 2016.
However, domestic car owners must not be burdened by the coalition contract.
That is why they are going to have a full compensation for the toll through the car tax.
However, the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often wrongly diagnosed
A Britin said that she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that it would die.
Karin Rother lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she was only a few years ago when she was diagnosed with another illness.
She actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease -LRB- CMT -RRB-.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnosis is a frequent problem for people with CMT.
About 23000 people in Britain are probably suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness.
The disease is destructive and persistent, and the symptoms are worse than time.
When she was 13, she believed that she would be able to survive with very poor survival prospects.
He thought that she would sit in the wheelchair before she would die 18.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said: ``As a child I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I fell constantly and everything took me longer.
I never had to go with the other children, and she was often going to go.
Amy said that in the age of 13, after several operations, she looked at her feet, when her physician had left the room and read that she suffered in FA.
``I felt guilty of me because I was curious, so I have told anyone, but I went to home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA-Society, ''`` she said.
When I wanted to reply, I was amazed and came into panic.
I thought that I would be with 18 in the wheelchair, and with 25, all my abilities would lose.
I made everything to me with me and work on my own fruits.
When she was born 17, she became aware that her abilities were not as strong as she presented and asked her physician.
He was easy, and told me, and I said, ``my love, I do not believe that you have that, otherwise you're already in the wheelchair.
I believe you have something far less of life.
After some genetic tests, the CMT was detected.
``When he said what CMT was, I felt as if I was a winner.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Aware month to draw attention to this disease.
Since the closure of the former military force, he worked since the closure of the former military force.
For about ten years, the former military place in Munich was no longer shot.
Nevertheless, each month of todous ammunition is found in the heart of the biosphere.
The granents are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be carried out on the ground.
In the heart of the biosphere area, there is a steather in the middle of the course of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the military site of Germany, closed after 110 years of military operations after 110 years.
Since that time, the 6500 hectares have opened the core of the biosphere of Bisanic Alb, open to 13, for hikers and cyclists.
The tax burden of businessmen in Washington is increasing with economic recovery.
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
The government in the country grew slightly in the country last year, and the economic recovery was accelerated, the newly published study took place last week, and the companies in the area of Washington did not form the exception.
Companies in the area of District District, Germany, and Virginia paid $27.6 billion to government and local posts in the financial year 2013, an increase in the rate of 3.8% compared to the revenue of 26.6 billion.
Last year, the state and local tax burden on companies rose to €671 billion, compared to 3.9% in the year, while the third growth year was in consequence after the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than the local charges, by 4.3 percent, in the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State taxation.
More than half the tax revenue of the District, 56 percent comes from corporate taxes, while 36 per cent of the revenue of the company originates from companies.
Virginia achieved the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is justified in a recovery of the properties of companies, telling the researchers what led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent in that year after the three consecutive years, with growth rates of less than 1%.
While there was a large proportion of these gains from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the deal seems to be put in place for the area of Washington.
Companies in the District, Germany, and Virginia spent more than $10 billion in government last year, compared to $9.6 billion - an increase in the course of a year of 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in terms of the increase in government and local tax revenue, as real estate taxes amount to almost more than one fifth of the tax gap in companies.
Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of its national and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
``In fact, the following is: A large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around DC, is either in the possession of the government or by non-profit organizations that are not paying real estate taxes, ''said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State taxi.
It is therefore forced to rely on income taxes for instance to offer the same services that other states have.
The recent recovery on tax revenue by companies can not be guaranteed for the recovery of the real estate market
Corporate revenue also seems to recover, that is the data.
Companies in the region reported about income taxes at state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
1 billion dollars in corporate income took the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies is not increasing in all three places.
The exit rate in the district was equivalent to 4.3% on the national average, while the rise was significantly higher than 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported an underaverage tax rate of 4.1 percent.
With 6 percent in all three quarters, Virginia has the significantly lower corporate income tax -LRB- in all three, of course corporate tax rates -RRB-.
The corporate tax rate is at 8.25% and in the district at relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that, in Virginia, lower government taxes and local corporate taxes are required.
In the study, the district was not investigated.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has decided to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same sentence as Virginia, and by 5% in the coming year.
If the state continues to achieve its income objectives next year, this law could reduce the corporate income rate from the country to 2017 by 3%.
In the meantime, the small business seems to go better in Washington, and they pay more State and local taxes, so the recent study.
Business taxes paid as personal income tax by small businessmen - a transition structure after which most of the small companies are organized - in the district, Germany, and Michigan last year by 20% to $2.4 billion, with a significant faster growth rate than the corporate tax as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country will probably continue to last this year, with an increase in the general added tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014, compared with the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the area of Washington could lag behind when the government spending cuts affect the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German beer in Germany
Hams and Malz - also in China a popular combination.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt Partner City in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, made in Frankfurt in Frankfurt - is the urgent wish of the Official in China.
``We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle themselves in our town, ''said the deputy party secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Taylor, during the visit of a SPD delegation in his city this week.
The role of the ruling Communist Party in the course of the conversation came back to the concerns of the twelf-million metropolis.
Shanghai, known in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
That is why people too have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
He was born in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
``For beer it does not need much: Good water, cereals and joy, ''added to the party upper during lunch.
This joy of joy has already been put to the host by Mr Li.
As a result, the function of the company came to life with the same name as the wine that was served by the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingvre is returning to German brewery art.
Tsingtao-beer will be cooked after the German purity.
More commerce
A second request from the Chinese host would be a flight direct link between Frankfurt and Germany.
The Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but in 2012 they were withdrawn from economic reasons.
``It would be worthwhile, ''the local politicians proved to be convinced.
``The business between our two cities continues to grow. ''
At the moment, passengers would have to take the replacement about Changsha in the province of Hunan.
The administration of the province of Michigan, the capital of Germany, hopes for the flight connection.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, focused on this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
``This is a very good idea, ''replied the Chinese vice president, Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany.
Partnership in France
He hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt in the next year.
He was already on the top, but it was not yet in this function.
He was only in office this year after his predecessor was transported out of office for corruption.
Even the local party chef Wan Qinglian had to go.
The action against government officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is enforced by leader Xi Jinping.
The new Heads of State had worked for an American company in front of his party, which is most unusual in the Communist Party of China.
He worked as top class in Fujian, Germany before taking office in Germany.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen cities.
The connection to the 9000 km will belong to those who are being cared for by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis in the Bible is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse.
In the next year, she wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros.
The family of Joan Hill ``hit the thumb ''
Joan Hill has been in the hands of a hospital in New York City for three days, but their daughter proved hopeful today that the 81-year-old comker recovered from her illness.
``Thank you for your continued love and support, ''said Melissa rivers today in a communication.
We hit all the fingers.
Her mother was born on Thursday after an emergency in a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville endoscopy, in the Mount Sinai Hospital.
The doctors keep them deliberately and carefully observe until they are satisfied with their condition, which is described as ``serious. ''
The reactions came from many pages, even in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly waste water and rising wages
In the future, more stringent environmental standards are applied in the future.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new dust cleaners are obtained from 1 September on a label on which the buyer can recognize central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, the emission class ``Euro 6 ''applies to more stringent nitrogen oxides.
In addition, there are more money for those who receive a domestic minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys numbers for 1.04 billion
Amazon confirmed what information was reported on Monday morning.
The announcement is surprising, not because no one was expected to take hands, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago, when the sale of Tlock took place in the video service of Google for a cool billion, and the cooperation appeared of course.
Thang, founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general cluster service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it was quickly a platform for players who wanted to publish their Bravourpieces in games, a ``YouTube for live games ''.
The Twitter interface.
And ``let 's play, ''a video genre, in which the better are playing, are very popular on YouTube.
It is precisely that YouTube is often called when you want to describe the message.
It is a mystery that the deal did not come with YouTube, because the company reports that it was ready to pay.
All that we know at the moment is the statement by Emmet Röar, President of Tash: ``We decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us to get faster than they do.
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of TStop.
It's hard to understand the attraction that takes place in the game.
It is a matter of looking at a friend at 3 p.m. on the shoulder, while she can see him in the head.
All these games could just look at you.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are Ego games.
I admit that the quick steps in which the Roger banners complete all the games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as it is not a gambling or Humorvirtuosis, his Twitter channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do I know what we know, as I have already said?
TGA is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet transportation.
And what exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It's hard to imagine that TStop is so elegantly integrated in Amazon instant video.
But TTrack has something that each company would have liked: Thousands of young men who are being used as advertising.
As the Chairman of Thang, Shar, said, Amazon and Tpe believe both in the future of the Gaming, ''and the medium does not show signs of being damaged.
There was a lot on the sunny night.
The concept of the organizer agreed.
In spite of the strong rain on the Saturday evening, about 1200 music fans came to go to the Open Air-Fest in Burgundy.
In the meantime, the rest had to be stopped.
``That was annoying, ''said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt light and fun.
There are two Spanish words that have formed the name of Amula.
Because the Open Air is going to shine on the day and on the evening by several shows.
Oh, and the fun comes anyway.
This was already on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors made to the Open Air.
A celebration for all generations had promised the organizers.
And that has been achieved.
There was also the possibility of being able to meet the needs of our guests.
You followed the first live performances, and you will enjoy cool drinks - relax and enjoy.
And that goes through the generations.
While one of them is on the beach bar, others will find themselves in a quarter of wine in the wine cellar, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the children's mouth, the volunteers had to do all the hands of all hands in the true sense of the word to become the captain and to create imaginative creations in the small faces.
The most advanced took part and took part in a lively workshop that was used by the Goodfootcrew.
To the great rain.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. prasselte he turned to the visitors, especially with families looking for the long and dry ones.
But the attractiveness of the House did not do so.
``There were more people than expected, ''said Ron Sem, who talked about the whole line.
That is why there is nothing contrary to a repeat of the great party in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event needs to be worked, Sem made it clear about the popular vote on Sunday.
When he said, he said that he had to be stopped.
Obviously the security company was booked with too little power.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the site.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the salted co-organizing talked about about 1,200 visitors who were living in the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound technology.
He was born on the top of the road.
The technicians were unable to create a fairly reasonable sound.
The plans could not be created because the tents could not be brought to the sea because of a tyre cot.
``In the next year, they will be in the event, as far as the organizers are concerned.
The premiere of the Amula-Open Airs was paid by the visitor.
And in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made a number of mistakes for the first time, while the second edition will have to be eliminated.
The organizers have to be criticised, even in the social network of Facebook.
``sorry, but for 12 euros you have just expected, ''says Melanie Meier on the event page.
``You unfortunately have taken over a little, ''says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems completely.
I think it is very good that some people try to put something on the legs.
Stand out, ''writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
The organizers will now have a year of time to address this criticism.
New Radom in Berkum: Wax of the landmark.
It is not good enough to do so.
Instead, the integrated part is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation radar will be renewed.
The new cycle will be slightly smaller than the old with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
But the size is still world record.
The last step towards completing the new case
The upper part of the old shell is separated and taken with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new case will be created.
As far as the weather is concerned, the action will go over the stage this week.
Participants in the Ihoned Challenge Challenge in the same way
Isabelle Arnold from the United Kingdom, in fact, was cast over the head that she violated the bone structure of her face.
It was painful to have it.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had a lot of work in the Ihoned Challenge Challenge.
Isabelle from Great Britain was as close to the head that she was responsible for her face structure.
``The water was so cold that I found, and while I was actually, my valley simply stayed, ''she said to The mirror.
Ice water is cut over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Williams a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that did not go, the jaw was left, and then I understood that something did not vote.
My mother and my sister saw that, and they disappeared almost in the pants, but had to go to the emergency.
The 20-year-old from the UK was supplied to the hospital to restore the jaw after the participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to a web site and a dozen on Facebook and Twitter.
Are you able to meet the castle clubs again?
Finally, there was always an end between the two temples of Burgundy.
They are now thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolrison castle, the late Richard Dimbath, a former chairman of the Wolek-shauser castle, took the project in the French Guédelon project.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the castle and the castle of the castle.
In the past, the positions seemed to have been dealt with, as was done with the history of the Wolrison Castle and possible reconstruction.
The two camps are now moving: Discussions are going to be held soon.
This is what we have to say.
``I called Mr Piffl, and I suggested that we could even sit up, ''Sjöberg reported.
In his view, all members of both clubs would be able to move together in the future.
That is what happened faster than that.
During the castle, the castle is situated in the heart of the castle.
Herbert Piffl, head of the castle, was very pleased about the call.
He has been in the hands of the castle since the death of India.
A new President is going to be found in a member of the Council in mid-September.
The association is currently about 40 members, according to the 74-year.
``After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have been able to relax, ''said the term of thought, to consider how to go further.
According to Piffl, the new chair is going to go to the Chamber.
Until then, the castle lovers could also make a current mood within their group.
There are still candidates for the Chair, Piffl says.
``But I'm confident that someone will find, ''he himself does not want to stand because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new leader was supposed to be a colonist.
The Tölzer wanted to participate in the project.
The different positions in reconstruction will probably remain in the future.
He appreciates Dimbath as the ``missionar, ''who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar projects in Austria and France would show that this idea does not have air.
Due to the high level of participation of the population, and by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: `I was also sceptical about the beginning.
But during the time I'm more and more convinced that it makes sense to promote the project. ''
There is nothing wrong about that.
In addition, the project would be effective by EU subsidies, visitor tickets and potential sponsors.
``The idea of reconstruction I personally do not want to throw away on board, ''he hope that the castle will move somewhat in this point.
Their aim to document history is important and good.
Then you could see.
Clever ways of saving at Uni-Lehrbooks
Since the costs for Uni-Lehrbooks for many students are more than 1,000 dollars per year, the Fast-2 tsemesterstudent Matt Schröder has a clever saving.
He found a temporary system for books of students of higher semester and offered nominal compensation to delay sales.
``My mathematics book usually costs 180 $, but I got it for 10 $for a semester and a Chick-A-Kek, ''said Schröder, 19, who visits the office of Georgia in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him 430, he said.
There were 120 $.
As a result of this, students have issued more than 1,200 copies for teaching books and study material, however, that there are different costs for students.
Online events and creative approaches are increasingly the solution to students.
The rental of courses becomes popular, and students can use a book for a semester for a while, often at a much cheaper price.
Nedera Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookshops, announced that the rent of text books has been doubled since 2011.
Polls in the industry show that about one quarter of books was rented in the College-bookshops in the past spring.
Less than half of the teaching books will be bought by the National Association National Association of College Store.
Here is the unique one for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price.
The ninth edition of ``the world of art in the world and the largest in the world in the world, and all in the world in the world -RRB- in the United States, and the world of the world in the world in the world of the world
Needed
If one of the notes does not make anything, used books are a good option.
For 93.49 is needed on Chegg.com.
Matt Casaday, 25, final student at the Briham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon 42 cents for a used edition of ``Strategic Media Decision:
The book was sold new for 48.
Academics such as Sven Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts recommended students to ask their professors to ask if earlier spending was permitted.
Sometimes updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the costs for the latest edition.
There is also a popular alternative for used books, except Chegg and Amazon.
Renting
The rent of teaching books is worth considering if you treat them well, thinking that they do not want to return and complete the books after the course.
You can save more than 80 percent from the cost of a new purchased book.
For example, a student could rent for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please inform yourself about the terms and conditions of your business.
If you do not return the book, the penalties may exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books

Why the ``Warans of the Galaxy ''did not become a ticket.

The film ``sex Tape ''on Cameron Diaz played only 14.6 million dollars on the opening weekend, while children's films are easily disappointed by the revenue.
One of the authors of the comic film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in the children the lack of quality could be the reason for the films.
In 2014, Collin described ``the worst year ''for child films.
However, in films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly showed the average of the Silver Film Show and Metacritic evaluation for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th July 2013.
The results are based on the views of cinema visitors and film critics.
Some commentators have said that the development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web cluster services such as Netdrix.
Director Tim Favreau, who is now working on dispositions soon, said about the website Hollywood: ``I believe the times will change.
We have to accept that and not try to carry out the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash sequences of the Hollywood productions, Netdrix has recently spent sales with the output content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as last year, in the turnover of 837 million dollars.
In the last summer, the director Steven Playberg criticised the film studios for focusing themselves too on the film of comics and being ``the core of Hollywood.

The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline of the cash results recently as simply ``cyclical ''and said to Hollywood:`` The next summer will be the biggest summer in the cinema.

Furthermore, the communication states that the army is committed to ensuring the security of the state. ''
The escalation of violence has borne cause for concern for the military that has already been more popular in the past.
The protests made by the opposition politician Imran Khan took place on 14 August on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qaddafi had called their followers on the Sunday to be bold.
``We will not decline if Sharif has been forced to resign, ''said Khan.

With the second season victory, Schrammel-Dream has shown the right response to the disappointment of Helsinki and will meet with success in the country games.
``We wanted to show a positive reaction, ''said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who took the course on victory.
``I thought I thought I got the whole from Thursday purely, and I put him under the bar, ''said the 26th year-old.
As Schrammel on 13 November 2010, which took place last time in a federal state, was still for Ried.
It will therefore keep him in special memory.
``For me this is something very special, I'm out of the rapid, ''said Schrammel.
As a result of the age of time by Mario Pavelic, Schrammel stood from the left on the right and made his cause very well.
He has a lot of experience that he can also exercise this position.
The gate has earned himself that he has already done some Assists, ''praised Barisic.
The team will be able to give you the opportunity to meet your needs.
The guests could also have been able to write them.
``God is thanks to today, `God said, ''Schrammel, who played on the gap of performance and results in recent weeks:`` The results have not voted, but the game was always well compared to the last year.''
Barisic even found that in many games there was better than today - against ``the strongest team that played in this season. ''
The first three-point since 26 July has therefore shown that the team structure was intact: ``Today my team has shown that it has character. ''
For him: ``That we have finally played to zero.
A lot of work has been done during the days of the country by the fact that, with Brian Basser, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger, several failures have been heard.
``It is not possible to forget this, ''said Barisic, who in the past three days has lost with Beger and Pavelic players,`` which was very stable in recent times.
Therefore, the country playing time needs to be used to ``wounds to ledges and in the physical field, ''declared Barisic, who has five of them in his ranks.
One of them is located in the heart of the city.
He finds himself for the team, goes to pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us.
Hofmann was not only the structure but also the second gateway.
It was the first hit of the game since 2 November 2013 -LRB- 4: 2 -RRB-.
Hofmann is: ``It is not true that everything is good, ''`` We have certainly had a bit of luck, but at some time the happiness needs to come back to us.
Now it was high time, ''Hofmann said.
But he said that he was too busy to work: `It must not always look black and white.
In the last few weeks, we have not played as poorly as it has been.
But we must not believe that everything is good.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team, which I can help at the moment.
That is true in certain phases, but that is what Hofmann said.
The company had a lot to blame for.
He regrets the quick contrast from the category of Magic, as well as to the regular gateway of Nutz in the 40 minute.
The only accusation I can do to the team is that we have not been specific enough to Tor in a few stages.
There have been too little qualifications.
Similarly, we have found ourselves in the same way: ``It has started quite badly, while we have even found a gateway.
In general, more would have been.
There is a number of people in the world.
We showed a powerful tribe in our bizarre task of the summer series ``My piece from the Rhöner happiness to last Friday.

The result of his research remained the right explanation for the name.
Therefore, until about 80 years, the goats have driven their animals from undergrained and stones.
At the foot of the building, the animals raised by the climb should have been planted.
In the meantime, the area has gained its significance.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve.
In the case of entering the stone collections, you should be careful because the basalt of the sun is also a popular place for those who live in the sun.
A walk leads to the tree, which is hidden.
There are also a lot of ways to relax.
Where is the Water City?
A waterburg that is looking for our next task, however, is often rare to find.
There is already a good impression from the building, but we have some historical buildings in the county to which the building could fit.

After weeks, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the Council, against strong conservative resistance to the EUSpecial Summit last week, gave rise to the nomination of his Minister of Foreign Affairs as head of the EU's foreign policy.
Renzi looks at how to show the government of English, the appeal of his own fashion team as a favorite fashion artist in the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
It also expects a boost to the ``reform package ''in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to make the left party base quiet.
In view of the conservative representatives of President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the President of the Council, the predominant view will be made in Rome.
The chief diplomacy of the EU, at the same time, will be the deputy of the President of the Commission.
The approval of the European Parliament is sure to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly announce the nomination of the 41year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party -LRB- PD -RRB- to the role of Italy in the EU.
He is aware of the fact that the ``enormous challenges ''have grown since almost two decades in leading party offices.
The native Roman Empire is married and has two daughters.
In 1996, her party career began in the youth organization of the former Social Democrats of the Nazi Republic of Sweden.
In 1999, Mowinini was founded for three years Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Independent Youth -LRB- European JungDemocrat -RRB-.
With the election in 2001 in the party council of the left-wing Democrats, she grew up in the high party politics, worked in the Department of Foreign Affairs, and soon became their director.
You have known traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, with studies on the NATO commitment in Afghanistan, with the involvement of the Russian Social Democrats in Europe and the United States.
Since 2008 she is a member of the Chamber of Representatives.
When Renzi was born in February 2014, he was appointed to his Minister of State.
If the PD once again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country that contributed to the 40% votes of the Party during the elections in May, then, as has been noted in PD-circles, Federica Movinini has a share in this.
There is little diplomatic experience in Brussels in Brussels, and that is what is happening in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and by the Baltic members, realistic research into the crisis in Ukraine is being carried out in Ukraine.
She is in favour of South Stream pipeline by the Russian company, South Stream, to be transported directly to southern Europe by Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as an EU president in July, Movinini went to Moscow for its first class visit to Moscow.
Photos that showed them with Putin were admitted in Brussels, just as they invited the Kremlin leader for a Milan economic summit for October.

The President deserves all his respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.

As a gesture of concern, the Prime Minister insisted that his government will not give rise to the controversial 35-hour week in France.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande was urgently called upon to show that he was united with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, came to power and criticised for the French `the faith in their future '.
Marine Le Pen, the far right leader in the National Front, said that they could not imagine that the new Valls government will keep to the end of a few months.
François Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls too has not had to make a new government if the old did not survive a summer.
``and the new will also survive the autumn or winter, ''said a Le Pen against support.
She repeated the reputation of her party after a resolution of the European Parliament and said that she was confident that he was the winner of victory.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the local elections in March, with the right-wing National Front in the elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal you showed that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the danger, before the end of the term of Dutch law in 2017, to collapse in several rival groups.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Faculty of Sciences, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and its rapid growth.
``There is a small window for possibilities, but the public opinion must feel fast that things change, ''`` He warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate.

Pro Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the electoral decision.
Near the Chinese flag there was a peking group near the Chinese flag.
The permanent committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday a framework law that allows only two or three candidates for the presidential election in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first of all achieve the majority support of a nominal committee, which is likely to be filled with pekingloyal members.
By this decision, it will almost be impossible to vote for opposition democrats in order to vote and to give pro-democracy activists the power of finding themselves.
Political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leaders fear that the Rufe to expand in other cities.

Lis survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese connection office in Hong Kong.

Putin is calling for Kiev to include the ``State Dialogue ''with the Ostukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media reports on Sunday, on Sunday, that the Ukrainian Government will take the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country.
His spokesman made it clear that Putin did not mean that this would be part of Russia under the control of the separatists, but his status needs to be redefined to Ukraine in order to give power to the Russian speaking region to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's appeal to negotiations with the pro-Russian insurgents, however as it seems to be followed by him since five months, the strategy for the separatists in areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the new region of Novorossija real independence for a alliance with Russia, as well as the West.
In an interview with the State Television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for withdrawing the areas of separatists in the Eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, in March and April, following Moscow the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
In recent times, the Kremlin and the separatists have been referred to as the ``Novorossija, ''or`` Neurussland,'' a concept that reminds us about the early revolutionary times of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who have died in the election campaign for the elections for the elections, while civilian communities attacked in their illusions, said ``in their illusions. ''
``We have to start detailed discussions, not just technical questions, but also the political organisation of society and the state status of the South Caucasus in order to preserve the interests of the people living there.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to the state needs to be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed since months by Kiev to reassure fears in Russian speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the Eastern territories the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
It is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine.
The clarification of the Kremlin, in contrast to Putin's remarks, stressed the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the immediate action of Crimea, with the majority of the 2 million inhabitants of ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties, the regions of Donezk and Luhansk, because the majority of millions of inhabitants are not Russians and showed a broad majority in Ukraine from the conflict.
The autonomy that was raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments authority in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, while the Kremlin is de facto to control an area that combines Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea is located in the Black Sea for the majority of Russian Marine and an important commercial port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the RoHS region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and plants that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his speech, the Ukrainian President Petro Porobor proposed on 7 June that Ukrainian legislation should take account of the Constitution, which would give rise to greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his vision of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, which is being accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders in the past week last week, following Russian troops and tanks over the previously peaceful region in the Ostukraine region.
The separatists supported by Russia, according to fears of Ukrainian security officers, have been the first step of a campaign for the acquisition of the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
This is why massive civil and military preparations are being carried out to help Mariupol, a steel forestry port with 500,000 inhabitants located between Novoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea Peninsula.
Porobor spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
``We are just before a point on which there is no more back.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided not to carry out concrete action, calling for further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers last week to support the occupied separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council on Saturday in Kiev.
The first was probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers in Ilowajsk who have been arrested on Sunday against 10 Russian cases that were caught a week ago on Ukrainian territory.
