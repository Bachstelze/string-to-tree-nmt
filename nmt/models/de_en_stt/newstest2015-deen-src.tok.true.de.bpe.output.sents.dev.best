return to the very American ideal of work rights as human rights .
the Congres@@ ses of Ell@@ ison and John Lewis have submitted a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as citizens &apos; rights .
`` How unions die , the middle class jobs die , &apos;&apos; said Ell@@ ison , a democrat and Deputy Chairman of the Progressive C@@ auc@@ us in Congress .
that is why I am proud of the civil rights law of President John Lewis .
this revolutionary law gives workers the same legal possibilities of discrimination because of the organisation of unions such as other forms of discrimination - and stop using anti-@@ union forces .
the addition of the national law on labour law to create an opportunity for discrimination by workers in the organisation of a union of union before a civil court of justice - and to obtain damages or penalties - is a meaningful and necessary initiative .
however , there is no radical initiative , at least according to American standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what Ell@@ ison , Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal suggest is the link to a very American idea .
in spite of the setbacks that the unions have suffered in recent years - in Illinois , Michigan and other countries around the country - Americans once have encouraged countries around the world to recognise , extend and comply .
there has been a time when millions of Americans recall when democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association were mentioned in a breath .
when the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that should ensure that the militar@@ ized auto@@ cracy of Hed@@ ki To@@ jos would be replaced by democracy .
in full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions have had a role in creating a new Japan , they used a language that explicitly recognised that `` the rights of workers in association and joint negotiations are guaranteed . &apos;&apos;
when the United States filled Germany after World War II , General D@@ wi@@ ght David Eisen@@ ho@@ wer and his staff pressed the Germans to write a constitution that would help to replace Nazi Hitler through a strong democracy .
in recognition of the fact that workers should be able to organise , and their voice in the new nation , the Germans introduced a clause that said explicitly : `` the right to establish associations in order to secure and improve labour and economic conditions and it guarantees everyone and every profession or business .
agreements that restrict this right or target it are zero and void ; they are illegal in this respect .
when former First Lady Ele@@ an@@ or Roosevelt held the presidency on the International Commission on Human Rights , which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the other authors made a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to form unions for the protection of its interests or join them . &apos;&apos;
for generations , Americans have been accepting the basic right that human rights are human rights .
as the country of other countries , as civilian and democratic societies can form , Americans declared that the right to the creation of a trade union - that they should be protected as an equal partner with companies and government agencies as an equal partner with companies and government bodies .
indeed , following these rights in America under fire , it is very wise to see the American ideal , so that the working people must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society .
how past@@ as of Martin Luther King said fifty years ago :
the story is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the working movement does not limit the nation &apos;s strength but has increased it .
by raising the standard of living of millions of people , work has created a market for the industry and raised the whole nation to unimaginable production levels .
those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but history preserves it .
history reminds us and we should do so .
formal recognition of the rights of human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
Keith Ell@@ ison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America in the past .
judge stops temporarily the law that would force all Ab@@ t@@ radi@@ atory practices to be closed to closure .
on Sunday , a federal judge on Sunday stopped the implementation of a law in Quebec , saying that it would probably have led to the closure of all the five shifts in government in the state .
this measure , which was imposed by Felix Jin@@ dal , Governor of Schleswig-Holstein , in June to the law , would force doctors who carry out abortion to acquire patients of patients in a radius of 30 miles around their practice .
however , the decision of the judge means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being , while requesting such a right .
`` The plain@@ tiff can continue to work legally while seeking to obtain these rights , &apos;&apos; wrote Federal judge John de@@ grav@@ elles in his judgment .
within one month , a hearing for the judge is scheduled for a more lasting decision for the law .
the decision taken in a number of decisions on similar measures was welcomed , saying that doctors have so much time to gain access to hospital .
`` Today &apos;s decision is that women who want their health and rights of their rights and their rights , &apos;&apos; said Nancy North@@ up , President and Chairman of the Centre for Re@@ productive rights that had been called the name of three of the five clinics of the state , to stop the law .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment was also extended to doctors from the two clinics who did not follow the complaint and had also applied for the right of transfer .
Quebec is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws , with the courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Beirut .
key issues of a law in Texas , which had forced most of the clinics in the state to be closed were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
the American College of O@@ stre@@ tri@@ cians and Gy@@ nec@@ áš , as well as the American Medical Association , have agreed that unauthorized rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions .
opponents of abuse consider the measures to protect the health of women , although some of them welcomed the effects of closing clinics .
only a doctor who is conducting abortion has a high level of trust .
if all the other doctors in the state are forced to do no more than abortion , this doctor would no longer be afraid to carry out the operation , saying the group .
in their arguments against the judgment , representatives of the state said that they would not punish doctors because of the execution of abortion , while their requests for patients would be pending .
delaying diagno@@ ses and lack of access to the best treatment possibilities leads to higher death rates in rural areas .
Angel@@ ina Jo@@ lie and her brother James sent a video for her mother that passed to egg crop cancer in 2007 .
there is a higher risk of women in the rural areas of Australia than for women in cities .
researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 of the Australian , and found that in 2005 there was only 25 % of the life after the diagnosis .
the research director Susan Jordan of the Q@@ IM@@ R Bergh@@ ofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state the risk of mortality during the study was 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
small STU@@ DEN : new medicines could slow down to lung and egg production .
the researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman influenced the chances of survival in the case of diagnosis , type of egg species and social and economic status .
for older women and those who had advanced their cancer at the time of diagnosis , the rate of survival was lowest .
for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , mortality risk was higher than for those in urban areas .
although the study did not investigate why women outside the city died of higher probability of egg cancer , Dr. Jordan suspects a delay in diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors .
`` This disease is treated at the best of gy@@ nec@@ ological onc@@ ologists , and they are mostly found in major cities , &apos;&apos; she said .
despite the improvement of telem@@ atics services to counter the distances , they proposed to improve the service of frozen doctors to give specialists the possibility of providing women to their place of residence , as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region .
Dr. Jordan has said that the study , regardless of geographical status , has generated a poor long-term excess of women in the egg crop cancer and emphasised the need for better treatment and preventive strategies .
the study carried out by Rio T@@ into to Con@@ quer Cancer is published today at the Medical Journal of Australia .
in March 2013 , El@@ isha Ne@@ ave , a young mother of 33 , learned from the gold coast that it had an aggressive form of egg crop cancer .
centres of garden are sorry to have the owners of the house
the fall in favour of the number of land@@ owners of 35 could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year when today &apos;s young consumers are reporting to a study of HT@@ A , as reported in the Financial Times , to reach the `` core age group on garden products . &apos;&apos;
the report states that tenants spend 55 percent of the amount of money that spend people in their garden .
the rise of people who live in highly urban@@ ized areas without gardens , the popular process , areas of parking and the fall of the garden are other factors that threaten the sector , in the estimated $ 5 billion per year in sales .
in the area of London where , over a period of 6 years , the share of house owners fell to 43 percent , the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported .
the HT@@ A and the Royal Hor@@ wark Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can not draw plants
Guy Bar@@ ter , chief chef for R@@ HS , said that `` container fermentation is very popular in the case of tenants , for example , because they can take their plants at a move . &apos;&apos;
the HT@@ A report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the `` golden age &apos;&apos; of the trade in the area because of rising domestic figures and economic prosperity from the late 1980 to the middle of the 1990s .
he also predicted an improvement in the market because of the better weather conditions in March and April last year .
the protest movement in Pakistan continues to go from the opposition politician , Im@@ ran Khan and the ghost of Tah@@ ir@@ ul .
in the capital of Islamabad around 1000 demonstrators have te@@ amed up the state television channels .
Mr Per@@ v@@ ai@@ z Ras@@ hid , Minister Per@@ v@@ ai@@ z Ras@@ hid , said that soldiers could have pushed out of P@@ TV buildings .
the station launched its operation for around 40 minutes but it is now broadcast again .
at the same time around 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Na@@ wa@@ z Shar@@ if .
around one kilometre of this they delivered with sticks and stones equipped with security forces .
the police set the side of the population .
the protesters asked Sh@@ ari@@ fs to resign , but this is rejected .
the country &apos;s army , meanwhile , calls for a political solution to the conflict , without wasting time and without applying violence . &apos;&apos;
after a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday night , the military said : `` the army is obliged to ensure the security of the state . &apos;&apos;
the military plays an important role in Pakistan and it has already been used .
the opposition politician , Im@@ ran Khan , discards Prime Minister Shar@@ if when he was elected in May last year .
the protests were escalating at the weekend after Khan and Qaddafi had called their followers to become Sh@@ ari@@ fs residence .
three people had been killed .
Turkey orders the US diplomat for the report of espionage .
the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed the former American diplomats of the country to a report on American and British espionage in Turkey .
Prime Minister B@@ ül@@ ent said that the business leaders of the United States and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday .
the German magazine The Mirror and the online magazine The Inter@@ c@@ ept pointed out that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency , Edward Snow@@ den , show that Turkey was a major activity area for US and British intelligence services .
according to Turkish news agencies , the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yip Erdogan found the importance of the report and said that all important countries invented each other .
a previous report , which was also targeted at the main service of Germany in Ankara , caused the Turkish Government to react more deeply .

we are counting on significant cases .
regional priorities do not exist .
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport .
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that they do all they can to keep the effects as low as possible .
the G@@ DL , however , did not say where they wanted to strike , so that it is hard to predict the consequences .
police of Mag@@ alu@@ f accused of corruption
on Friday , the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of Cal@@ vi@@ à at the office of the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the head of the police of Cal@@ vi@@ à on the island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption of businessmen and bar@@ owners in the notorious Bin@@ ge-@@ powered hotspot of Mag@@ alu@@ f .
the main Commissioner , José Antonio Navar@@ ro , was arrested against him by several businessmen from Punta Ball@@ ena , the street in which most bars and nightclubs of Mag@@ alu@@ f are in custody .
according to the online newspaper of Mallorca Di@@ ario , the prosecutors submitted evidence to the Office of Justice on Friday on Friday evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Cal@@ vi@@ à .
two further places of interest have been arrested by the Spanish Civil Civil in connection with corruption and will be consulted jointly with Navar@@ ro by a judge .
the national Spanish daily newspaper reported that the angry night secret owners said that the authorities had serious consequences for their business .
`` It &apos;s not more to earn money , it is about survival , &apos;&apos; one of the businessmen said to the court .
let our livelihoods go from the game .
we have nothing to lose .
Mag@@ alu@@ f , in this summer , made international headlines because of an vir@@ als of 18 years of British tourist .
since then , the island authorities have attempted to halt the illegal behavior of non-@@ alcoholic residents in Mag@@ alu@@ f by minim@@ ing the number of participants to the notorious alcoholic beverages .
the Play@@ house Club , which took place , was forced to be closed for one year , while Play@@ house and the pub Car@@ n@@ age together have to pay a penalty of 5@@ 5,000 € -LRB- 7@@ 3,000 dollars -RRB- .
the tourist resort of Mag@@ alu@@ f , which is mainly popular with young British holidays , is also known for several accidents under alcohol , including the trend of `` Bal@@ con@@ ing , &apos;&apos; the people of a balcony to the other or from a balcony in the hotel pool .
the first spring of early days with n@@ anders and with stor@@ my weather conditions affects flights from the airport .
the spring has a winter surprise , with strong shows and strong winds , which caused flights from the airport .
in the evening until 21 : 00 , further temperatures fell to the city , to 6,@@ 6@@ mm , which had already gone to Sunday during the night .
the last eruption was the result of a number of short , stor@@ er-@@ sh@@ auer , including a sea which started just 20 hours ago , for almost 4@@ mm in about 10 minutes .
after the winter had made last week for an early dose of spring , the temperatures in the city on Monday fell to a maximum of only 15.@@ 8 ° C
the unfortunate weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Liverpool .
the aircraft had to be landing shortly after 7.30 p.m. but it was hit by a shock wind - a sudden change in the wind speed or direction over a short distance .
at this point the wind reached about 50 km @/@ h on the ground at the airport .
the flight data showed that the aircraft had to start at a second landing flight and that the aircraft had to start at about 20.@@ 40 .
the flight delays resulted in the delay of some of other flights , including one from Dubai and a Qu@@ ant@@ as flight from Sydney .
on Tuesday there is a maximum temperature of 16 ° C , with possible displays .
Matthew says : the highest time to make a big move .
in view of the technical progress that is threatening to turn our cosy home into high-tech switches , our column is Bernd Matthew with a highly familiar electronic accessory .
while I write this here , I look at the spiral cable that links the receiver to the phone and I think : Bo@@ ah , which makes that possible ?
but behind this there is a comment : if the cable would not be , in the very short time all the listeners would fly around , and that would be significantly more than that .
is there already valid on the ek@@ el@@ tron@@ ical ?
no , ty@@ pos : electronic -RRB- the sector is the rule that has purchased the world premiere of today &apos;s electric waste tomorrow .
and those of us today still have a tube screen in the living room which says simply that he is rejecting television in principle .
why these considerations ?
because we are pushing the I@@ fa to the radio tower in this week , we are showing our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics .
the La@@ ie , who once had a washing machine and CD player , now does not even understand the purpose of the equipment that will be spread to him by using un@@ tangible and intuitive expert instruction : `` Connec@@ ted Home , W@@ ear@@ ables , Health Care and Urban Technologies &apos;&apos; .
is it still possible ?
what do you want to talk to people who seem to spread voluntarily ?
for about 20 years , it has been the case that we want to link our house .
this is how the yo@@ ghurt itself takes itself , so that the fires in the holidays on the Mal@@ dives tell us that it is in the room of work .
and would it not be wonderful if we get from the office from the air conditioning to our immediate arrival ?
however , this requires air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly be true soon : we have to raise our arms clock , say `` Sau@@ gen ! &apos;&apos; and at home the vacuum cleaner .
it is misleading .
there is nothing less than a revolution : `` The limits between white and brown have turned out to be , &apos;&apos; they can combine the washing machine with a headphones that send out the weather report and data bri@@ lle as to how long the pizza is needed in the oven , but nothing is useful because we are in the St@@ au .
from everyday practice we also know : if a newer device is really needed , the battery is guaranteed .
the reason for this is that the spiral cable will survive the next radio shows .
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
thousands of Israeli children from the areas close to Gaza returned to school on Monday in the schools after they had spent the summer in air bases , while the production of missile and mortar on their communities during the 50-@@ day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed , while the area of fighting recovered .
the school start brought communities in the south of Israel a feeling of joy and expectation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern city of Ash@@ do@@ d , employees of the Pas@@ ho@@ sh `` Children &apos;s Garden , &apos;&apos; made by a rocket , prior to meeting the students from the walls and boots .
`` We have a bit of fear , but they are excited , `` said Ron@@ it Bart , An@@ well said in the Ki@@ dow@@ utz Sa@@ ad and his English teacher .
many children from our area urgently need the return to a routine .
her 11-@@ year-old daughter , Sh@@ ani Bart , said it feels a bit strange to suddenly go back to school .
`` It was difficult times and we did not go from the house , &apos;&apos; she said .
President Reu@@ ven Riv@@ lin visited the Ki@@ dow@@ guard close to the border with Gaza to offer his support .
until a cease-fire of last week , thousands of residents of the border communities like Sa@@ ad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move from Gaza to safer areas and to escape the missile fire and mortar fire .
many of the inhabitants of Nah@@ al O@@ z , a community near the border with Gaza , which had been killed by a four-@@ year-old boy from a Palestinian murderer hesitate to return .
the Ministry of Education has said , for example , that a dozen families have not yet returned .
their children were provisionally accommodated in other schools .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in S@@ der@@ ot , a border town to Gaza , which has been severely drawn from the Palestinian attack .
he appealed to the children to learn much and said `` we will make sure that their knowledge buys and offer security . &apos;&apos;
Israel and Hamas agreed on a permanent ceasefire last Tuesday .
the ceasefire provided an immediate end of the fighting ; important problems , however , remain unresolved , such as Hamas &apos;s call for a lifting of the Israeli blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza .
Israel is calling for the disarmament of Hamas and the passing of the bodies of two of the Israeli soldiers killed .
a new round of indirect discussions is expected to begin in Egypt this month .
in the war , more than 2,@@ 100 Palestinians were killed , three quarters of civilians , and at least 4@@ 94 children according to the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel disputes this and it estimates that it is at least half of those around fighters , but it did not provide any concrete evidence of this information .
on the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , have been killed .
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza , 4,@@ 5@@ 91 missiles and murderers , fled to Israeli cities , most of which are in the south of the country .
meanwhile , the Israeli military has had more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
the Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the area of Gaza .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the courts and the battles , the education authorities moved last week to the beginning of the school year .
`` I hope the school is open soon so that we can learn more , like children in the world and Jewish children , `` said Mohammad Am@@ ara , a 13-@@ year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City .
after election in Saxony : CD@@ U-@@ Vi@@ ze Stro@@ bl is questioning N@@ P@@ D prohibition procedures .
in view of the deaths of the N@@ PD in Saxony , CD@@ U-@@ Def@@ vi@@ ze Thomas Stro@@ bl has spoken before the Federal Constitutional Court at the end of the current N@@ P@@ D ban .
Berlin - L@@ aut CD@@ U-@@ Def@@ vi@@ ze Thomas Stro@@ bl , is going to finish the ongoing prohibition process against the N@@ PD before the Federal Constitutional Court .
`` N@@ PD is worse than at the last time , &apos;&apos; said Stro@@ bl , who is also CD@@ U@@ type in Baden-Württemberg .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the N@@ PD is fighting politically and is not before the Constitutional Court .
the N@@ PD failed during the vote on Sunday .
a first attempt at a ban on the extreme right-wing party had failed in 2003 because the protection of the Constitution had also been at the forefront of the N@@ P@@ D .
in December 2013 , the Federal Council presented a new application in Karlsruhe after a long time .
the Federal Government and the Bundestag did not .
Har@@ burg : tents for new refugees
refugees are now placed in tents at the newcomers .
the headquarters for refugees in Har@@ burg burst from all seams .
now the internal authority has given three tents to the Red Cross .
the national ministers have just been informed - they are little enthusiastic .
`` This Ha@@ ur@@ u@@ ck action continues to raise citizens &apos; reservations and give district leaders no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane housing of refugees , &apos;&apos; says Britt@@ a Herr@@ mann , a group chairman of the Group of the Greens @/@ European Free Alliance .
your party demands that the district administration of Har@@ burg is currently providing unused houses to accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
the reasons for filling up in the initial recording are the landing of help stations - and the fact that the authorities can not provide seats in follow-up facilities
many refugees thus remain longer than the regular three months .
the skin prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years , showing a widely observed index .
the RP Data Core@@ Logic Hed@@ onic Home Value Index for home homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August , the R@@ P-@@ data from Monday .
through this rise , the total increase in June , July and August is 4.2 % , the largest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual increase in prices amounted to 10.@@ 9 % , more than twice as the rise in the 12 months until August 2013 , but the increases had not spread evenly across the country .
the research director of RP Data , Tim Law@@ less , said that Sydney and Melbourne launched a two-@@ divided market .
the figures from RP Data show that last year &apos;s skin prices rose by 16.@@ 1 percent in the past year , in Melbourne by 11.@@ 7 percent .
the following markets are Liverpool , Brisbane and Darwin , where the prices rose by five and six percent .
at the other end of the scale there is an accident which has been severely hit by cuts in state expenditure .
Mr Law@@ less said further that in the early months there would be an increase in the real estate that would undergo the market `` a real test . &apos;&apos;
`` When you look at the high rates of auction prices , a generally fast sales rate and the constantly expanding are low , is the fact that housing prices will continue to rise in the next three months .
in an opinion to the New press , he is contrary to statements by the business leader , peer Med@@ au and this of this .
the style of the college is not , it is said in the communication .
this is how the Med@@ au family had been informed about the promotion of the college at the beginning of June .
the statement that the plans had only been known in July are definitely wrong , &apos;&apos; they say .
at the same time , he refers to the fact that the plans are not about ` fixing or making decisions &apos; but about ` preferences &apos; .
the expansion of the narrow road to the castle is also less dramatic than from the Med@@ aus .
there was no mention of a nine metre wide .
this is the current state of 5.@@ 50 meters , which is a metre wider than before .
the point of view of the Med@@ au-@@ operators that they will only be used by students of the university in the future does not want to apply .
this will not happen at all because this can be intelligently resolved as at other public parking .
thinking of the residents
according to the Ministry of Ministers , the children &apos;s son of the children of the area and to lead to the parking deck , according to the university president .
rather , he has to bear in mind that this is not only the case of children , but also those who are living in the area .
so this is much more than the vested interests of Mr Med@@ au , which is the case .
whether the criticism of the parental coup of extending the road would be `` the few natural spots of Cob@@ ur@@ gs , `` the reader himself can decide . &apos;&apos;
at the beginning of October , P@@ aster@@ l wants to inform the city council of the construction of the university by 2020 and , in this context , the importance of new development . &apos;&apos;
peer Med@@ au had last week informed the parents of the age of children about the University &apos;s plans .
thus , the access to the new parking deck does not want to be connected to the campus and the Friedrich-@@ St@@ ung Street , leading to the Med@@ au-@@ Berg .
in this way , the narrow streets would have to be extended to an area of about one kilometre .
according to the high calculations of the Med@@ aus , traffic in the park of the Hohen@@ fel Castle would become ten-@@ fold .
there is daily talk of about 2000 vehicles .
so far the city did not want to express its opinion on the part of the city .

German Economy cut about 0.2 % in the spring
the crises around the world have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 .
this shared the Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations .
consumption alone flourished the economy in the spring , while investment went back .

at the same time there is the largest cycling tour across the area of the town of the Pyrenees , the cycling paradise near the Netherlands .
more than 1000 participants thanked themselves with their registration at Jos for the organization of this tour through the Münster@@ land .
in various magazines this tour was offered to interested parties .
we come from Den Hel@@ der and are over night to take part in this tour .
we also want to know more about this kind , and we want to learn more about the routes through the villages of Stein@@ furt , Bor@@ ken and Co@@ es@@ feld .
after logging in to the club , St@@ a is a member of the Association .

the organization ran without problems and there were no negative incidents , &apos;&apos; Heinz L@@ öl@@ fingen began a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately , there were not so many participants , as the organisers had hoped for , which was likely to have been the poor weather forecasts and the bloody rain .
`` We are going to see again in 2015 on 30 August or during another weekend , but cyclists still spoke again to the town and the organisers planned to plan .

and he also explains his paci@@ f@@ ism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also how it not only marked the music - which has been characterized by opera lovers .
the latter brought to the as@@ ke@@ astic monk who created `` through sub@@ traction &apos;&apos; as he says `` by making everything impossible to move . &apos;&apos;

Lenny Henry : my father never took me to the arm .
never said `` I love thee &apos;&apos;
Henry was one of seven children of a family of prisoners in Du@@ d@@ ley in 1958 .
his father , who died as Henry 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship .
Henry tested for a comedy , Ru@@ dy &apos;s R@@ are Records , which was founded in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and was developed from the series on Radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mixture of reg@@ gae and r@@ ap , with lively melodies .
but Henry had to work through some difficult child moments .
he visited `` many &apos;&apos; therapies after the death of his mother , and Henry is looking forward to his relationship to his father .
it was hard to know him .
he never looked at his face , but he only heard his voice .
let your sister calm .
move around !
I want to look at cri@@ bs .
my older brothers Se@@ ym@@ our and Hilton - when I was a child - went to the pub and spoke about things like the form of beer or the beauty of a cri@@ cket attack .
I never had such a discussion with him .
most of my life he was this serious type in the corner which read the newspaper .
Henry recently opened a foundry in Du@@ d@@ ley , and although the conditions are better than at times of his father , he gained an insight into how the life of him had been .
it &apos;s now a little lighter , but they are dark , it is dark , deep sty@@ ques of the arts are dark and they are dark .
my father once turned around to the bath and then he could hear him slowly how he started to sing because he could wash the foundry .
when I ran there , I was aware that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table and that I was bigger than him .
however , Henry grew up as a child without love of his parents .
my father never did , he never said `` I love you . &apos;&apos;
only when my mother went wrong at the end of her life , we began to say `` I love you , I love to say . &apos;&apos;
through his own daughter Bil@@ lie , with Dawn French , he could share the love he had missing as a child .
would you like to stop by saying `` I love you &apos;&apos; ?
let me go to me to get rid of me !
hello , I &apos;m 22 !
with Dawn French .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still married to French , where he was married 25 years .
dawn is a good person .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
he himself was a mother of his mother .
this contributed to her death .
when I was very busy and symptoms of diabetes showed , my doctor said `` You have to be radical .
so I moved through this fitness and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is hard .
no one likes to eat car@@ rots .
it is possible to see in his elegant and short-lived bar .
since he was praised by critics for his Oth@@ ello , he was united by the theatre .
it was followed by the comedy of the crimes , and then the F@@ alls of August Wilson .
this is a different experience than the Sit@@ com@@ s and comic works that filled his busy working life .
he started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a DJ discovered it on the stage when he did and wrote to New Fac@@ es about him .
`` I have been for a very long time of the only black I@@ mit@@ ator @/@ Com@@ coon on television . &apos;&apos;
he studied in the profession .
I had to learn more not only to the public but also from 1975 to the beginning of 1985 , as I was able to become an efficient W@@ itz@@ ry machine , I was a Star , and that really was difficult .
Lenny in 1975 at New Fac@@ es
as his manager had the stage law on the Black and White Min@@ str@@ el Show , a light entertainment programme in which people `` black people &apos;&apos; led Henry his comedy over five years .
the staff was very friendly and helpful .
I somehow wish it had never happened , but I do not regret that I did .
it was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
but this `` years of award-winning light pillar of British television &apos;&apos; was also a `` grotesque par@@ ody of the black people . &apos;&apos;
through the introduction of figures that celebrated British black culture , Henry worked in the 1980s on an alternative Com@@ ed@@ y@@ circle .
the first series of the Lenny Henry Show went to the broadcast in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was known as the chef G@@ areth Black@@ lock in the Com@@ ed@@ y@@ serie Chef .
advertisements , documentaries films , TV channels and film rolls took his next decade , but according to his BBC series , Lenn@@ y@@ Hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv 2008 he thought : `` What do you think as next , because it feels like you only have the time to go . &apos;&apos;
after that , there was a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title of What is Great About ?
the first was Shakespeare .
at Shakespeare I was very allergic .
I had never learned anything about him at school and I mostly held him for a domain of the middle class , White in Stru@@ ghts and a carbon head at the front .
so I was very afraid of this .
all we said for the show , Peter Hall , Tre@@ vor Tig@@ n , Adrian Les@@ ter , Ju@@ di Den@@ ch said `` You should try it .
do not do badly if you do n&apos;t know what you are .
take a couple of words in the mouth and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare .
Henry had 20 lines from O@@ thel@@ los recently for the documentary and he was enthusiastic .
I felt I could do so .
it was almost as if someone had put the head at last .
`` It &apos;s a serious thing , put it seriously , and your text , researched a bit .
the samples were brutal and I read this for months before we made it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and this simply did not .
and soon he appeared in the comedy of deception .
suddenly I was in the national theatre and I could hardly believe .
there was a moment when I thought , `` Oh , you have changed you . &apos;&apos;
there was a technical error and Henry felt instinc@@ tively that he had to maintain the public .
`` A little voice said to me `` You have to bridge 10 minutes while repairing the computer . &apos;&apos;
instead , the stage manager announced that the idea would go as soon as the problem had been resolved .
I went from the stage and something in me said `` Oh , thank God .
I am not responsible for that .
I can leave this to the other .
`` You play in a play , which is how to stay in your role . &apos;&apos;
Henry in F@@ alls at Du@@ chess Theatre
the text for F@@ alls was demanding .
panic is very good ; it strengthens the view .
this was also good , so it is like a big sign of the gods who say `` This is your provision . &apos;&apos;
he says this , of course , with a Thursday .
so I remain .
I really love that .
I love to be in a sample room .
however , Henry still has the head of a comedy .
I decided not to make a stand-alone comedy because I find that this type of immediate satisfaction is somehow dangerous from a chamber full of strangers .
if you want to do so , you will have to go to the wall .
I sometimes live live in the Apollo when I want to do so , but overall I do not have as much as I did earlier .
I ask him whether he will once again make a standalone comedy tour .
the fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning , a part of this and the end of a journey - I do not think I want to give up .
is that what is happening here ?
I think so .
I am happy to be an actor .
it makes fun .
there is always a history to be told , and that is great .
I love stories .
people love stories .

Kenya registered officials to contain `` ghost workers
Kenya has begun to register all state officials by deleting `` ghost workers &apos;&apos; from the government &apos;s pay lists .
staff who would not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid .
the government claims that thousands of people will receive pay from the public service even after their departure from the public service .
President U@@ hur@@ u Ken@@ y@@ atta promised to fight corruption in the public service at the time he took place in 2013 .
during an examination at the beginning of this year , it was stated that at least $ 1 million -LRB- 700@@ ,000 £ -RRB- had been lost to `` ghost workers &apos;&apos; and through other abusive financial practices .
the government claims that salaries continue to be paid on accounts after a person died or leaves the public service .
all officials will now have to appear in the next two weeks on identification centres to ensure that their data are included in biometric registration .
all who did not do so without a credible apology from the pay list passed the communication .
`` This approach makes a significant contribution to ration@@ alising the public service by defining the actual number of officials , and the pay list on both levels of government is being eliminated - `` ghost workers &apos;&apos; are eliminated , &apos;&apos; said Anne Wa@@ ig@@ uru , the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of decentr@@ alization and planning .

this was divided into a court of judges on Monday .
in the chamber , A@@ chen@@ bach has been deceived by the purchase of works of art and vintage and awarded to Johan old as more than paid for the price of purchase .
this was also higher than the agreed commission .
A@@ chen@@ bach purchased for 121 million euros of value for Albrecht .
children need roots and wings
he was at school for 44 years , of which 23 was the head of school .
from this time Manfred Richter knows many of Peter@@ sh@@ aus@@ ener and Koll@@ bach from their time as students .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but it has always been borne by his efforts to see the people .
the snow is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland .
judges was born in 1930 in Trau@@ ten@@ au @/@ North Bohemia , today Tr@@ ut@@ nov .
at the age of 14 he was interested in the course of four years of the School of Teach@@ ers .
one year after that , the German Federal Republic of Sudan was founded .
within half an hour the family had to leave .
after several months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 .
in this way , judges turned into the upper part .
the education of teachers took place in Germany .
to this end , Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometres to the next station at the next train station , with the train to Germany , where there are three kilometres across the town from the town to school and in the evening .
after two months , Manfred Richter received a sleeping point in one of the Red Cross homes in Germany : together with up to 15 students in a sleeping room .
in 1951 he made the first and 1954 after three years of teaching .
since Ober@@ fran@@ ken had not had any freedom to teach him , he went to Ober@@ bay@@ ern and came to school at the school in Koll@@ bach on 1 November 1954 .
the `` milling room &apos;&apos; room was his first class apartment in the school house .
in 1958 he was part of the School of Music .
this house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school had been broken down in 1968 .
until then there were three classes and five in Peter@@ shausen .
from the year of 1968 @/@ 69 they were grouped in Peter@@ shausen in today &apos;s town hall .
when the school association was founded , there was only primary school on the ground .
in order to avoid a return in the smaller school , Georg Sig@@ l , who was launched to Karlsruhe , and Manfred Richter became his successor .
however , Peter@@ shausen grew and the children and their teachers were able to take part in the construction of this building since September 1982 , extending to judge retirement in 1997 .
Manfred Richter bl@@ ames the uncomplicated generosity of the senior citizen of Ludwig Gö@@ tz , who also had to build a working room and the expansion of 1997 , although this was not eligible to the directives on school buildings .
`` Mayor Gö@@ tz was very indebted , &apos;&apos; he reminded himself .
in his career , Manfred Richter never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a meeting of a school council of law and justice : `` It must never forget the love , &apos;&apos; Manfred Richter , which he had heard as a young teacher .
`` You have to give the children two things : roots and wings , &apos;&apos; says the 8@@ 4-@@ year-old .
and he had to know : `` This is not always . &apos;&apos; whether he only believes his students or his own six children , it is not entirely clear .
in any case , judge sometimes was unconventional .
when students looked after themselves , they did not receive a criminal work and they have not been arrested .
at the expense of the community , judges had had to create two pair of Box@@ hand@@ shoes .
for the benefit of school , judges had a good relationship with the former Mayor Ludwig Gö@@ tz -LRB- CSU -RRB- .
this moved to the party of party after his retirement in 1996 , at least as last last on the CFSP list for the municipal council .
but judges was elected and joined the CSU .

HR@@ 4@@ -R@@ AD@@ TO@@ UR 700 cyclists set up at the spa park of Bad Salz@@ hausen and Sch@@ ots A9 .
if cyclists turn on their tour to Bad Salz@@ hausen or Sch@@ ots R@@ ast , this is nothing special .
on Friday , however , the number of views of the hotel made the impression : the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4@@ -R@@ ad@@ tour together with accompanying tro@@ ss enjoyed a break at the lower Kur@@ park of Bad Salz@@ hausen and later there was a party under the free sky in the Scottish Alt@@ eb@@ urg@@ park .
under the motto `` Rad@@ eln &apos;&apos; and celebrations on newly discovered paths between N@@ id@@ da and Kin@@ zig , the participants met in Bad Vil@@ bel on Thursday and experienced a concert by Van Baker &amp; Band .
on Friday it was serious that the cyclists took the first stage .
in Bad Salz@@ hausen the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter , who had been launched in Bad Vil@@ bel by bicycle , welcomed the head of the home of Bad Salz@@ hausen .
to the refreshment of the body and mind , all kinds of good things had been prepared : the Land@@ wives from R@@ ank@@ stadt and Nieder@@ -@@ Mo@@ ck@@ stadt had had 85 sheets of apple .
`` These cakes can only ba@@ it land women , &apos;&apos; a participant from A@@ ul@@ stre@@ eb@@ ach praised another bit .
cold refreshments could be found at the beverage tax of the gym .
the `` duo Bravo &apos;&apos; maintained the visitors of famous melodies and music@@ als and enthusiastic applause .
the beautiful ambience of the park has been relaxing .
one Lord also enjoyed a head of his partner : `` He deserves to &apos;&apos; he has already put it to the side of circular cycling chains .
in the meantime the mayor and the crew had to work : they were interviewed at the fountain before the drinking house of reporters Rainer Jan@@ ke and used the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salz@@ hausen .
Tobias Hagen has also contributed to this , and he has been able to do very quickly , but he has had plenty of technology on the ground .
as he wrote three phones and a radio device with his staff and the 15-@@ member of the police , wrote fac@@ ebook entries and made reports , a check was also needed .
`` The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-@@ Main region , &apos;&apos; he said .
the number of participants is a bit of accommodation that is available to you .
in Category I place the participants in hotels , in Category II in collections .
from the spa the cyclists had a good impression when they collapsed after a year and a half : `` Ch@@ ü@@ ss ! &apos;&apos; !
`` It was nice in Bad Salz@@ hausen ! &apos;&apos; It was to the point of departure .
after the arrival in Sch@@ ots , the group was allowed to take a short break .
but in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alt@@ eb@@ urg@@ park .
under the direction of the Scottish society of tourism and urban marketing -LRB- GT@@ S -RRB- , the park had a nice festive atmosphere and , of course , had been prepared to be prepared for example .
in his role as a member of the Federal Ministry of Justice in Germany , the Ministry of Experts , Markus Ho@@ ß@@ feld and MS@@ C Chairman of the Board of Directors welcomed the visitors as a member of the Board of Directors .
the Three were pleased to be pleased about the `` many operations in Sc@@ ots . &apos;&apos;
DJ Tobias Hagen then gave the dance stage free .
the possibility of staying under open skies was used in spite of the sporting activity on the bicycle .
among the guests there is an increasing number of citizens who were as enthusiastic as the great spirits of cyclists .
on the second day the stations of Bir@@ stein , Guardian and Bad Or@@ b were on the second day , including a concert with the cutting edge .
yesterday , after 180 kilometers of cycling , the athletes arrived again in Bad Vil@@ bel .
dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for `` conspiracy &apos;&apos; against the government
a total of 33 policemen were reported in Turkey as a result of the suspicion of the `` conspiracy against the government . &apos;&apos;
the police authorities did not make a direct comment .
among the arrests there are 14 senior police officers , who are reported to report Daily News .
some of them were involved in corruption tests against government workers , including four ministers of government last December .
in July , a number of Turkish police officers were arrested , because they were founded on organised crime and telephone numbers .
the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yip Erdogan -LRB- who was Prime Minister -RRB- described her as part of the activities that have been led by the Islamist ghost of the coup against him and other people in positions of power .
not all children in Ukraine return to school
schools almost everywhere opened in Ukraine on Monday -LRB- 1 September -RRB- after the summer holidays .
this day is traditionally an important day for families and , like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister brought his daughter to school .
there , he told journalists that not all schools had re-@@ opened , however , that he decided to defend the country for future generations :
the September celebrations were not held in any school .
the sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine .
we need to fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of Ukraine , which is a huge common Ukraine of Ukraine , must fight for a peaceful sky .
Alek@@ san Past@@ uk@@ show , school director of the school in S@@ law@@ j@@ ans@@ k , spoke about Russian .
we hope that there will finally be peace and that children will receive a education that will be useful to them in the future .
the first school day of the new school year is celebrated traditionally , with the children wearing a shirt , ball in the hands and flowers of their teachers .
with R@@ ona Fair@@ head , the BBC might have found the great director it needs .
she meets with a proud retirement age from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of the Tor Party .
and she has an experience of its own .
her career began at the worldwide management consultancy company B@@ ain and Co . , which went to Morgan Stanley , Bom@@ b@@ aner , ICI and the media world of Pear@@ sons .
she was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and went back when the chief post of the mother company Pear@@ sons went to a younger male colleague .
their withdrawal is supposed to be almost 1 million .
their political ranking , too , is solid .

not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
the trust works in two directions : from the inside to the first guard of its own man@@ y-@@ point hierarchy in the BBC , but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things are wrong .
this provides for an almost unsustainable du@@ o@@ pol , which requires complete comprehensive reform .
but what new leaders would risk would be to go to everything and divide an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while he perhaps wants to do his job .
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many of you are interested to see the BBC - power , money and status .
while the competition moves closer and new technologies threaten old , comfortable collateral , the upcoming negotiations for the BBC are linked to special dangers .
for the modest sum of 14@@ 5,@@ 50 per year , the British public is buying the world &apos;s largest media company .
the BBC tells a good story : she says that it reaches 96 % of all households , and each of them costs only 40 p@@ ence per day .
and apparently the BBC continues to rise to the top : 53 % continues to support it today , compared to 31 % 10 years ago .
the viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed : I now receive messages on my mobile phone and I look forward to my i@@ Player .
but it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution .
she needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found it .
Perry from Texas says that lowering T@@ we@@ et was not authorized .
a T@@ we@@ et from the official account of the Republican governor of Texas , Rick Perry , on Sunday there was a reduction in the way of the democratic council , which is at the centre of criminal prosecution against him .
the T@@ we@@ et was deleted later and replaced by another of Perl &apos;s user .
there is currently a T@@ we@@ et from my account which was not authorized by me .
`` I do not value the T@@ we@@ et and I deleted it , &apos;&apos; it was said in the future news .
employees of Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
although the T@@ we@@ ets of Per@@ pology passed official user account , it was not clear who actually served the feed .
in the former T@@ we@@ et an un@@ favorable picture of the Association of Tra@@ vis County , Ro@@ sem@@ ary L@@ efer@@ berg , has been drawn up which was convicted in April 2013 because of the consequences of the tax .
Perry put a veto on financial support of their offices when they refused to resign what could be an indictment of Perry - which could be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin .
the text of the T@@ we@@ ets is as follows : `` I do not always go drunk with the three-@@ digit alcohol level but when I do it , I put Governor Perry when he makes it pick up . &apos;&apos;
I am the most beloved democracy in Texas .
L@@ DR &apos;s office was not responsible for the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry .
this was led by Michael Mc@@ Cru@@ m , a special prosecutor from San Antonio , who was chosen by a Republican judge .
Perry did not guilty and said the indictment was a political trick .
his high class team of lawyers applied to the judges who complained to the case and argued that the law with which the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is acting is inconsistent .
Perry stopped 7.5 million dollars of government money to the public integr@@ ity unit of the state - based in Tra@@ vis County and , in cases of state corruption in Texas , to resign .
this veto caused a public complaint from a left-wing Watch@@ do@@ g-@@ group .
Perl is often updated - and sometimes famous .
after he had completed as a fifth at the election meetings during his presidential election in 2012 , Perry went to speculation that he is going to stop by sending a T@@ we@@ et of a photograph in the vicinity of a lake , with the words `` South Carolina ! &apos;&apos;
Berkeley again explains housing market as `` normal &apos;&apos;
one of London &apos;s most prominent buildings pointed out that the housing market returned to normal level in the south-east of England .
housing homes in the capital were hot and are the subject of huge price rises , which reflected the Bank of England because of the widespread fear of a credit bubble to place ceilings on mortgage loans in June .
Tony P@@ id@@ g@@ ley , founder and CEO of the high class of construction , said on Monday on Monday : since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013 , and added that this offers a `` stable practice of practice . &apos;&apos;
the housing market in London was well placed during the downturn as foreign buyers were forced into the capital .
according to information from the catalog , the prices in the urban area increased by 18@@ ,5 percent over the last year , far than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole .
the average sales prices rose by about one fifth in the last year at the end of April at the end of April .
however , in the last few months of real estate ownership in London for foreign buyers , a stronger pound has made some of them less attractive through the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric by the creation of a possible ` Vill@@ tax &apos; before the general elections in May .
the London real estate agent warned in the last week that the mortgage market report for April , in which more stringent lending arrangements were introduced , would also lead to less market growth in the case of real estate sales as at the prices .
new data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in the mortgage approval in July , which also indicates that the housing market is cooling .
Hamp@@ tions International , another real estate agency , corrected his forecast for the rise in housing prices in London from 2015 to 3 per cent , on the basis of what is already the weakest of the skin .
the exchange of transactions in the most expensive areas of London like Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington has decreased by one quarter for a quarter , which is the broker WA Ell@@ is .
however , the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing , because the amount of appropriations for futures amounts to more than 2.2 billion .
Mr P@@ id@@ g@@ ley added : `` The demand for the right , well-@@ planned product at the best locations remained stable and the result was also stable .
in June , the company reported that it had sold 3,@@ 7@@ 42 of new homes to the year until the end of April - almost one third of the crisis before the crisis .
the annual fiscal year rose by 40 percent per year to € 280 million , sales by 18 % to € 1.6 billion .
in a communication on Monday before the annual assembly of the company , Mr P@@ id@@ g@@ ley said that the revenue for Berkeley was expected to meet the current market during the year .
the analysts unanimously estimate the annual annual tax of € 450 million .
in the afternoon in the London Trade Fair , Berkeley stood at 23.@@ 96 in the course of the year .

however , Victoria Justice from the nick@@ olo@@ de@@ on@@ series `` i@@ C@@ arly &apos;&apos; and `` Vic@@ ial &apos;&apos; did not assume that they are falsified by pictures of her . how do I know what I am talking about ?
I would like to thank you at the beginning .
Bu@@ zz@@ feed reported on the late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop stars Ari@@ ana Grande reported the authenticity of the alleged photos of her .
exclusive excer@@ pt from Howard Jacob@@ son , a new novel about love and the letters `` J . &apos;&apos;
they were best described ; they slowly found up like a cardboard that can be found in the rain .
occasionally , he said to him that he was too serious , exhausting , intense , dist@@ anced , and perhaps rather scratch .
and he then sh@@ ook him .
he knew how to do so .
he was st@@ ony , as was in I@@ gel , yea .
the last victim of this bar@@ ge was a very beginning affair that has been more promising for a relief of the isolated bor@@ es of his life than otherwise .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons has been a tre@@ acher@@ ous beauty with un@@ told hair and a folding heart from a village on the North Island , which even even disappeared and was as a port .
they had come to the south , which K@@ of@@ n held for their T@@ ante .
for several years no one had lived in the house .
the pipes were l@@ eck , in the baths there were still fans who had left their traces on all windows and the garden was one of them , and the garden was supervised with we@@ eds that saw as huge carbon heads .
it was like the house of a children &apos;s fairy , both threatening and tempting , a garden full of secrets .
portrait of the author : Howard Jacob@@ son , the novel `` J &apos;&apos; on the Lon@@ gl@@ ist for the Man Boo@@ ker Prize 2014 .
the short@@ list will be announced in the next week .
at the beginning of the 20th century , he was one of the most popular in the world .
your feet are too big .
songs of this kind no longer have been played on the console because of their aggressive aggression .
nothing was banned - simply nothing had been banned - simply did not be played .
it has been successfully altered as the word is obsolete .
the general taste of what would have done and what the rules would never have , and as the people on books chose the V@@ om@@ -T@@ eller of million@@ ies , cook@@ books and love roman@@ es , they chose the ball at the music .
in the euphoria of the day K@@ of@@ n began to play an imaginary piano .
A@@ il@@ inn did not understand this .
`` It was a famous song of a jazz pianist named F@@ ats W@@ aller , `` he declared her and automatically set two fingers to his lips .
his father had always done to stop the letters J before he came from his mouth .
it had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played with his own father , so he had told .
if you put a word with a J without putting two fingers on your lips , it will cost you a P@@ enny .
it was not very fun at the time and it was not very funny now .
he knew he was expected to do so .
it had to explain what jazz was .
A@@ il@@ inn had never heard .
jazz , even if he was not banned directly , was not played .
the improvis@@ ing was no longer modern .
it was only square for a single `` if &apos;&apos; in life .
people wanted to be very safe at the beginning of a melody where they would end .
that is also the mind .
his un@@ predictability made people nervous .
and jazz was musi@@ cally the cause of mind .
although he had been 10 years old without having heard of Sam@@ my Davis Junior , K@@ of@@ n knew something about jazz from the half-@@ secret collection of old CDs of his father .
but at least he did not have to explain that F@@ ats W@@ aller was black .
at their age , they probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black .
again , there was no laws or constraints .
a compliant society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of group musicians .
people with af@@ ro-@@ Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temper@@ ament and body construction for entertainment and sports .
people who originally came from the Indian sub@@ continent , as from the nature of electronic talent , have been blessed and have been working with the task to ensure that no family remained without a working phone .
what was still left from the Polish community was taken into account ; what was left of the Greeks had been broken .
those from the Gulf States and the Levante , whose grandparents had not left the country quickly , have had to be accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being charged . they even believed that the flames would be treated as the next - laboratories and S@@ his@@ ha-@@ pillar restaurants looked after themselves and were subjected to inaction .
each according to his abilities .
as they had only heard ball@@ ads , A@@ il@@ inn was hard to understand , as the offensive words that they had just sung could become more expensive .
music was an expression of love .
`` These are not really offensive , &apos;&apos; said K@@ of@@ n .
except for people whose feet are too big .
my father never insul@@ ted , but he loved this song .
he was too much , but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of security .
nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal leaves .
A@@ il@@ inn still did not understand .
why would your Father have anything to love ?
he wanted to say that it was a Ju@@ x , but he had to put two fingers to the lips in their present .
she already thought he was rather strange .
`` It appeared funny , &apos;&apos; he said instead .
they sm@@ ashed their head and the lock that I had to do .
there was nothing else around the world than to see her un@@ coated .
there was nothing he otherwise wanted to see .
`` When you say , `` I say it without conviction .
but this still does not explain why .
she seemed honest .
are my feet too big ?
he still looked at it .
do not leave your feet directly .
perhaps your buttons , a little bit of money .
and you tell me because my buttons are thick ?
they hate ?
of course I do not .
this is only the stupid song .
he could say `` I love you &apos;&apos; but it was too early .
`` Your thick buttons are precisely why you do , &apos;&apos; he tried it instead .
I am a bit of per@@ vers .
this is not correct .
it had to be funny .
when he tried to be com@@ ical , he often brought himself into difficulties because he did not like his father above the reassuring Char@@ m that needed to be subjected to cruelty in jokes .
perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he wanted to be .
in spite of his friendly eyes .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons was shot red and it rose from their deck@@ chair , threw the console and washed the wine that it had eaten .
wood of wood was not an excuse for him .
in her emotion she seemed to tre@@ mble , as Palm@@ n@@ el appeared in the storm .
`` And your rock head is exactly the reason why I feel perverse unto thee , &apos;&apos; said saying it
apart from that , I am not .
she did so because of the unnecessary dis@@ friendliness of his words as well as the fear that appeared in her eyes when they opposed him .
did she thought he would beat her ?
they did not tell him where they had grown up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here .
the same huge and icy ocean broke here as on the banks .
the same confusing men , with more thick@@ er skin and more subtle skin , did as their ancestors had been as smugglers and beaches of the beach , attracted by pub , always prepared to rise to a woman who refused to be denied themselves .
do you have a lot of experience in this field ?
they would have had a big blow when they did not !
they only like to go - the most used word was for an erotic appeal between men and women , a counter-@@ gift to the loose love ball@@ ads from the console - they only beat them .
as I see it , this was unnecessary , because it was already an act of violence .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons gave him a sign through her body .
he rose from the deck chair like an old man .
she also felt , but his sorrow surprised her .
this was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew .
she saw him how he had removed himself - as from a room at the top floor - a man who complained by something he had caused himself .
Adam leaves the garden , she thought .
they felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had made their hands against them .
a man from her turned from his back , his back , ashamed to be defeated , without fighting combat - why was it a sight that seemed good if they could not remember a single time that she had already seen here today ?
when she once again was , A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons looked at her feet .
several years before the events that have just been mentioned have been worked by ES@@ ME Ang@@ baum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-@@ year-old researcher on behalf of O@@ f@@ now , the non-@@ legislative supervisory body for public sentiment , at a short presentation of the continuing violence at low and medium levels in precisely the way in which they were expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to be reduced
`` It has been done and much has to be done , &apos;&apos; she wrote ` she wrote &apos; she wrote ` to give the inn@@ ative aggres@@ siveness of a people who have caused thousands of wars , and most of them have gained from all of them , especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human friendliness has rarely been felt by
but some of the properties are becoming in@@ tractable .
the higher the church tower , the lower the passion he continues to cry .
the people who live at the time of hearing have made themselves feel better than those who want to do so , but they do not only consider the virtues of marriage and family life , but it does not only mean that the former raw materials of rural communities , as well as our urban fabric , also see evidence of the emergence of a new and left dispute at home ,
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to exagger@@ ate , &apos;&apos; she said she was his mentor when he had read the whole report .
I suggest that you read less novels .
ES@@ ME wal@@ ks cut their head .
I have to ask whether you are A@@ thei@@ st ?
`` I think I do not have to say this , &apos;&apos; ES@@ ME Ang@@ l answered .
are you lesbian ?
once again , ES@@ ME was calling on her right to privacy and refusal .
femin@@ ist ?
once again , silence .
`` I do not wonder , &apos;&apos; Luther Rab@@ ino@@ witz finally said , `` because I would be against A@@ thei@@ sm , Les@@ b@@ entum or feminism .
this is an area where free employment is concerned .
we are serving a free society of ours .
but certain types of hyper@@ sensitivity , which are absolutely acceptable and commendable , can occasionally distort the results you have presented .
they themselves seem to have prejudices against the church , and these things , which you call to be the ` dead &apos; and ` ro@@ h &apos; , could be interpreted by others as an expression of what is , of course , an expression of strength and vitality .
if you continue to go around , he says , as if it had happened yesterday if it had happened , it will mean that the country is living its essential life .
ES@@ ME Haf@@ baum looked at it while Rab@@ ino@@ witz spoke .
behind his head a LED font in Flam@@ ing@@ or@@ osa repeated the advice that O@@ f@@ now had given to the country in the last quarter .
smile to your neighbours , select your partner , listen to Ball@@ ades , visit Music@@ als , use your phone , talk to me , tell you , listen to you , excuse me .
talking is better than silence , the spoken word is better than the written one , but nothing is better than love .
`` I absolutely understand what you want to do , and I do n&apos;t understand that they had spoken to the end - and I say nothing more than we still do not heal as effectively as we do ourselves .
my concern is that , without warning , we might find out how to repeat the mistakes that have only happened at the time of Daphne , which is what we have had to say .
this time , however , it is not the others on which we can leave our anger and our distrust .
Luther Rab@@ ino@@ witz formed with the hands of a pyramid .
to prevent this from happening can be seen .
`` You go too far , &apos;&apos; he said , `` when you call actions as a `` mistake &apos;&apos; that our grandparents have perhaps or not committed .
they also go too far when you say that they would have left their `` anger &apos;&apos; and their `` distrust &apos;&apos; to others .
it should actually not be necessary to remind someone of the way in which we speak as to how to protect the past , not from `` us &apos;&apos; and `` others &apos;&apos; .
there was no `` us &apos;&apos; and there was no ` others &apos; .
it was a time of injustice , this is all we know .
`` But if we are honest to ourselves , `` I have to say `` Let ES@@ ME `` no part of society can claim to be good . &apos;&apos;
I am not afraid of anyone .
whether it was bad or good to do what has happened is happening .
that was at the time .
nothing needs to be said - we are in agreement .
and as long as we do not have to be charged , it does not need to be blamed , if this would be reasonable and it would be a way of til@@ ting it .
but what is the past if we do not learn from this .
the past serves to forget it .
if I may say something about this , let me say something .
Luther Rab@@ ino@@ witz passed his pyramid .
`` I &apos;m going to consider her report , &apos;&apos; he said .
on the next day when they went to work , they had passed from a motorcycle driver who , as described by passer@@ by , had been on the foot in a kind of `` brutal anger . &apos;&apos;
there are cases .
Les@@ o@@ tho@@ -@@ military member says that no coup is planned ; Prime Minister remains in South Africa .
official representatives of the military in Lesotho began to have planned a coup to the government &apos;s fall and said that they had been opposed to police officers who are accused of killing political fanatics .
Prime Minister Thomas T@@ hab@@ ane fled from the country and said that the country &apos;s army occupied its headquarters and government buildings in the capital .
the Premier brought his family to the south of South Africa after he had reported threats to attacks .
military spokesman Major N@@ tl@@ ele N@@ to@@ i said that there was , in fact , no coup that , however , the military responded to the threat from `` political fanatics &apos;&apos; .
`` What happened this morning was that the staff of the defence forces of Lesotho , having received several intelligence reports , had had some elements that , in fact , wanted to interfere with some of the political and partisan young fanatics who had just had to do so .
the South African government spokesman , C@@ lay@@ son Mon@@ y@@ ela , said that military action made the impression of change .
`` When nobody said that the government had been torn through violence , all of the reports agreed that the activities of the defense forces of Zambia are showing signs of a coup , &apos;&apos; said he .
speakers of the military of Lesotho passed on Sunday that the soldiers had to go back to their homes and be able to find the situation in the capital .
in the meantime , the Deputy Deputy Mo@@ th@@ et@@ jo@@ ya Met@@ sing takes over the rule of governance during the T@@ hab@@ ane absence .
T@@ hab@@ ane said that he believed he had become the target of his attempt to combat corruption in the country .
since June , there has been great tension since June after T@@ hab@@ ane &apos;s parliamentary meetings were caused by disputes in its unity government .
he said that his actions did not undermine the government , despite the other accusations .
production in the eurozone on a 13-@@ month basis
the rise in production in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point of the last 13 months , closely following the study .
the final mark@@ it of the manufacturing company -LRB- PM@@ I -RRB- fell to 5@@ 0.7 in August , at a stand of 5@@ 1.8 in July .
an indication of 50 gives an expansion .
new orders went back and factories experienced at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia .
the figures are meeting before the meeting of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- on Thursday .
the markets expect the Bank to set up a clear plan for dealing with a delaying recovery of the eurozone and the threat of deflation to only 0.3 % .
there is speculation that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , could provide further information in the course of this week whether he is considering quantitative relief for the eurozone , according to those made by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than no growth at all , the effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for the producers have become clearer , &apos;&apos; said Rob Dob@@ son , senior economist at Mark@@ it .
the group PM@@ I for Germany , the largest trading partner in Russia in the EU , fell to 5@@ 1.4 in 11 months .
in the meantime , in the second largest economy of the bloc , France , PM@@ I , fell to 4@@ 6,@@ 9 .
France remains a victim , as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion of stagnation .
it is also not reassuring that growth incentives in the key industries of Germany and Spain and in Spain and the Netherlands are not reassuring .
the decline in the industry is likely to attract analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives .
a positive message came from the Republic of Ireland where PM@@ I increased to 5@@ 7,@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economist at I@@ HS Global , said : `` The best thing you can say for the purchasing department index of the eurozone from August is that the sector continues to grow . &apos;&apos;
he added : producers in the eurozone now seem to find life very difficult , because the current increase in geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased uncertainties have clearly undermined the economy - in particular , consumer confidence and the fact that some orders are delayed or even cancelled , especially large contracts .
he said that it is becoming more and more likely to mean that the ECB had to launch a type of QE , although we suspect that this will be limited . &apos;&apos;
the survivors of Beslan have died : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of school on how the children they had had are still suffering .
ten years ago , more than 1,000 people from Chechen militias were taken as hostages at a school in Beslan .
more than 330 people , more than half of them , were killed in the three-@@ day Mar@@ ty@@ rium that shocked the world .
we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of Gre@@ u@@ el@@ tat in the classroom .
exactly one decade after the appalling siege of the school of Beslan at the age of 3@@ 34 people , including 186 children , the heroic survivors had last night in front of a new Apo@@ calyp@@ se in Ukraine .
as fanati@@ cal Islamist terrorists captured and killed the beginning of a new year of school , this seemed like the evil of evil .
the tragedy united West and East , and suddenly , surprisingly , turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
ten years later , we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of Gre@@ u@@ el@@ tat in the classroom .
we found surprising young people who had overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hell is going to be followed by .
your greatest hope ?
there is now an end to the war that Ukraine is looking for and , in the children of children - .
the girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb up to the school of school .
she was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer , famous in her underwear , to climb back into the torn school sport hall after a mine had exploded .
A@@ ida was completely confused after her mother Lar@@ issa , now 40 years of age .
both were dead but they survived .
`` A woman said I was going to go to my life , but I could not , `` said A@@ ida at the time .
my legs were bloo@@ ded .
I stood on and climbed again to look for my mother .
a soldier brought them into security .
after a number of operations she held himself in love , but yesterday said : `` three months later the pain returned .
I am afraid I have to operate again .
some gran@@ ules are still in my knees .
their aim is now to become dentist to help the people who have been helped by doctors .
`` This tragedy changed my life but it did not break me , &apos;&apos; she says it .
that is what I have happened and that can not change
once in the year I always go to the sports hall to remind me of those who have stayed there .
my friends and I do not want to talk about this in other days .
the pain is too big .
my best friend and future class of class was killed there .
we played when we were small and we dreamed of going to school .
`` I do not want to marry until I study my studies and begin my career .
I am thinking of a family later .
she says that the siege will always remain part of her , although the memory of each year becomes more weak .
I am glad that many people around the world remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the United Kingdom and everywhere .
when I see the photo from me as I see back to school , I think many people see it for the first time , understand our disaster and contribute to doing so .
the boy who fled through the ball@@ ots , in the opinion , his mother is dead .
it was his first school day -LRB- Russians go to school for 7 years -RRB- .
as a seven-@@ year-old , he said : `` I have told me that if there is an explosion , I think it is an explosion . &apos;&apos;
after an explosion , he thought she would die .
she said to him : `` Run . &apos;&apos;
full of fear , she had to be dead and looked at the way he fled , took it to the hand and fled through a ball@@ ar .
his father , Vladimir , who joined his son outside , said : `` Dam@@ ir told me that his mother had died .
he said : `` I could not save it . &apos;&apos;
in fact , Tam@@ ara was out there and he had been injured in hospital , and in turn he was in the assumption that her son had taken .
according to her reunification , she said : `` I am delighted .
I did not believe .
he was running and he did me .
Dam@@ ir was later flown to London -LRB- the newspaper News of the World now opened -RRB- to receive the title of a Bar@@ nar@@ do of Children &apos;s Kids from the former Prime Minister , Tony Blair and his wife .
`` This horror is following every day , but I wish I could stop by remembering that he said yesterday .
but I can say that it is in my memory .
I still know that I threw all my toy guns straight away .
but now I can play computer games with guns and that is not a problem for me .
`` I have no fear of returning to the sports hall , but I do not think about myself .
I remember these children , with whom I have played at the Court , which have not managed outside .
we never say that they have been killed or dead .
we say they have remained in the sports hall .
I remember very well to my journey to London , especially on the toys where I was able to pick up what I wanted and drive in one of the open cars .
but now he is afraid of the place as Ukraine , where wars cause the kind of disaster that he and his friends have suffered .
this horror follows every day , but I wish I could stop reminding me .
`` I &apos;m sorry about all those who are suffering from the atrocities , `` Dam@@ ir , who worked as volunteers last week in a monastery .
I would like to help .
I am going to go to the police and I hope that they will take the training academy next year .
his mother Tam@@ ara , 48 , said : `` 37 children from our neighborhood have been killed , can you imagine ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege ; there was simply no children who could call and go around , and this silence lasted many months .
she remembers her journey to London with Dam@@ ir .
the people in London when I told us told us .
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support .
she was grateful for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004 .
I wish I could call Cher@@ ie and simply say that 10 years have passed , but I still remember the meeting and her husband in London .
I still remember how Dam@@ ir wanted to eat Bor@@ ash@@ sch and she called her all the local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he played in a restaurant .
and that was just a month after horror .
I was surprised that the British shared our pain and supported us .
she said : `` I always think that this world has not become better in this 10 years .
in Ukraine the war now continues , and every day people , and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are precisely such children as ours .
I think many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or similar .
I simply know what these people feel all horror .
and I can not stop this
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
Dam@@ ir was big and it is a very gentle and quiet boy ; he is not aggressive or angry .
he , for example , is not looking for revenge ; he is not overwhelmed by the last atrocities .
I know he does not like to remember , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and they ign@@ ite the candles .
when he was small , he suffered - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa , the face of us , for hours .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he continued his weapons and other military toys .
I can hardly believe that I have been so sure for a number of hours that he was dead and I would never see him again .
when I arrived after the explosion , I looked at me and I saw the hell around me around me to share body parts everywhere .
I was absolutely sure that my small boy in this hell could not survive .
`` I remember that I was talking to him , `` Dam@@ ir , continue to go away , &apos;&apos; but I was sure he had not heard me .
but he has heard and he went away .
and thus life , unlike many of others , continues for us .

the boy , the terrible picture after the siege to the symbol of the Gre@@ uel of Beslan
comfort : the Bes@@ ria Georgi@@ j Ly@@ in with his mother Fati@@ ma after the siege of 2004 , the right of an image of Georgi@@ j today
his bloo@@ d-@@ filled face was of fear when he ran his life , while Chechen terrorists shot his class@@ mates .
his image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan .
his mother of Fati@@ ma , 54 , a doctor , had taken him for his first school day before she went silent to bring her older son to the university .
`` I left the farm for two minutes before the terrorists landed him , and thus my small boy stayed there for three terrible days alone , `` reminds them .
it was not entirely because there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my Georgi@@ j managed to survive .
the closer this date , the more serious it is to think and talk about it .
there is no single day on which we do not remember this tragedy .
we do not think that it is long , I think it would be yesterday , some of the scenes from these days would follow forever .
nobody will forget that ; I promise you .
the image of Georgi@@ j -LRB- left -RRB- was one of the most shocking of the attack .
I remember that Georgi@@ j wanted to go to school this day .
I only knew that he was alive when I saw him on television .
and now there is even this statue of Georgi@@ j in San Marino .
Georgi@@ j does not like the image and it is hidden at home in the library .
I understand that , but I also believe that the people of all the world feel our pain thanks to this image .
Georgi@@ j says today : `` It is important that this can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we have ever experienced the truth .
people always investigate such tragedies and never learn about the truth .
and now they investigate the crash of these Boeing in Ukraine .
are we ever going to know what caused him ?
this world becomes something terrible .
`` I can not understand how it is possible if you ask the people who do not want war
ten years is nothing other than such pain .
we need dozens of years to forget it .
I have attacked my health and I still feel .
for about three or four years I had a few nightmare because of the siege , but then it became better .
I later went to school in 2004 and I was afraid .
I thought to my friends and classes who had been killed .
that is why I always go into the sports hall when the 1st September move closer .
I want to pay tribute to my old child friends .
it is hard to go to the sports hall but I have to do .
I do not feel as the victim ; this is now part of my past .
I will not forget , but I did not .
my life continues .
this year I completed the school and I visited a medical college in W@@ ater@@ ka@@ w@@ ka@@ z .
I am going to become heart ch@@ ir@@ urg .
my first election was a training in the army .
I wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not .
I wanted to fight for my country but that is not happening .
Georgi@@ j Fan@@ i@@ ev , 20
the boy who survived , although he had caught feet of a murderous terrorist
one miracle was born during the siege of a murderous terrorist during the siege , but he managed to survive .
during the siege he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that had been attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it really is a miracle that he was not killed .
`` We feel as if it had been yesterday , &apos;&apos; Georgi@@ j , who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer , was unable to do so because of his health damage .
it is still with me that it is nothing I have left behind me .
I have now been older and people say that children can easily deal with serious experiences - I have to say that this is not true .
`` In 2006 I worked with psych@@ ologists and felt better , but I can not forget it
and I would like to forget .
in 2005 - in the year - the first and only time was that I went back to the sports hall .
I lost the consciousness .
I will never return to it and ask me not to show you where I have been sitting in this famous picture .
wild : Georgi@@ j Fan@@ i@@ ev today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop .
my pain is immense and I wear it with me every day .
my friends know that I do not like to speak about it and they never asked about school .
physically it is good .
I should be careful with my injured knee , but I can now walk well .
but because of my health , I was not able to study at the secret service academy of the FSB in Saint Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have submitted my documents , I also submitted medical treatment and they replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have had two years behind me .
he learns the treatment of all the animals `` from cats to cooling &apos;&apos; .
he said : `` I knew that I would never report my children from my experience .
children should not be aware of this and they should , of course , not suffer .
his mother , Marina , 42 , said : `` This pain never leaves me .
he is worse in my soul if the anniversary moves closer .
I shall go to the celebrations of remembrance .
I know that Georgi@@ j will not go .
it must be much harder for him because he was there and I did not .
I waited home and could not help .
I am grateful to God for being returned to me .
it remains in us .
Georgi@@ j is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is hard to accept this if there is something unfair .
he is a boy , he likes sport but he can not attend his knees
he has been operating several times , he can run but there is no sport .
I would say that he has overcome the horror at 50 % , but it never can be overcome and forgotten .
this terrible experience is always going to follow .
many friends and neighbours have been killed at the siege and that only reinforces my pain .
I have lost many people whom I knew good and which were expensive .
my son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that God could make me do , but my heart is a lover of the prayer .
I know of families in which new children were born , but also jokes who never had secret .
it is hard to accept that life continues , even if we do not want that .
I never forget what my heart did in me when I saw him in hospital .
and now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and I can not believe it
we were formerly a friendly country , how can it be that we are now fighting ?
people and children are suffering , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are being killed .
if only all of these rebels move - as far as possible .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
if you want to make pictures or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the most expensive option is a water@@ tight point of view , as is the Nikon Coolpix AW@@ 120 or an Ac@@ tion-@@ Cam like the Go@@ Pro heroin 3 + Silver Edition that are both for about 300 .
I have recorded these photos with several cameras that are available at a price of less than 350 .
regardless of the equipment there are a few rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a water@@ tight camera , make sure that the battery and other subjects are dense .
put your camera on the photos or videos you want .
some of the cameras and cameras are equipped with scenery and recording of the light to optimize the exposure time for the conditions of water .
and before you jump , check until your equipment is operational .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 minutes , other to 50 or 60 feet .
look at our shopping guides and reviews of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
make multiple recordings because many do not end .
point of view includes an LCD with which you can compose images .
also if you have a LCD , it is difficult to see this under water and the correct image setting is a cause of luck .
so you do a lot of pictures .
if your camera has a friction mode that makes a number of pictures with slightly modified exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the light becomes dramatically worse than you continue to remove from the surface .
if possible , you will be close to the surface when you make pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to bring more color to your photos ; the deeper you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also a good advice , but it is all the more important because of the poor light conditions .
it &apos;s especially important when you work with an Ac@@ tion-@@ Cam : these devices often have a fixed angle , which means that you have to move to your objects if they want to complete the image .
Andrew Law@@ son was a man of the variety whose character changes , even in such a gigantic organization as the N@@ HS .
as an advisor to an@@ aes@@ thesia , he devoted his career to the task of saving the patients both the ag@@ ony of the disease and the number of treatment .
among his patients , his wife was a MI@@ 6-@@ staff who had to live with the devastating effects of torture .
Law@@ son knew that doctors are important to diagnostic and disease , while the treatment mainly deals with something other than something other than pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one who began to do so .
`` I did not feel , &apos;&apos; he wrote in May this year .
I had difficulties , I was getting rid of me .
while he fought with the gri@@ p@@ pe@@ like symptoms , he noticed that he made his wife impati@@ ent .
`` I want to do everything as soon as later , &apos;&apos; said he .
when Juli@@ et was on a business trip for one week , Law@@ son felt very unusual and had no reason to worry .
there was something in the air .
he asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest .
it was only two weeks ago that he had been skiing in the French Alps .
the result of the X-ray test was .
he suffered from Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , an evil cancer that attacks the skin of the skin .
as with most cancers , the exact trigger is mostly difficult to determine .
for example , while some smokers are suffering from lung cancer , not all lung cancer patients have been smokers .
but Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is different .
in almost all cases the trigger is an asynchron@@ ous effect - contact with the fiber construction that was considered to be a `` miracle material &apos;&apos; which has been recognized as deadly .
for most of us Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is a disease that can be ignored .
finally , asbestos is a product of the past .
the most vulnerable type of asbestos has no longer been used in the United Kingdom since the 1960 &apos;&apos; s , as the industry voluntarily undertook to use it .
also where he was still employed , only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plum@@ bers , construction workers and workers for example .
as an industrial risk from another time , he seems unlikely to be worrying .
but this self-@@ satisfaction is inappropriate .
Britain , it seems , is experiencing the culmination of a Mes@@ ol@@ th@@ eli@@ om epidemic .
there are more deaths from Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om here as in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , almost two of them die of this disease as traffic accidents .
annual figures of measuring cases since 1980 and the likely future deaths in the United Kingdom .
the reason why we are now seeing the deadly effects , although asbestos has been illegal for years -LRB- in 1999 all types of asbestos have been banned -RRB- , Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is only developed for decades .
and the scourge of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is not limited to former workers of the construction industry .
asbestos was , and often is , in the houses in which we live , the offices in which we work .
and thus , Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om knows no class barriers , financial limits , professions or age .
the privileged bases , from the elegant shops in London to private schools , are not a protected area .
the buildings of Parliament are contaminated .
even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy , they have already been identified as the source of this deadly massacre .
Andrew Law@@ son was not old .
he was also no plum@@ bers .
indeed , he was hard to imagine where he might have been in contact with asbestos .
then he found it .
`` It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy &apos;s Hospital , where I spent six years .
all of them - students , nurses , doctors and nurses - to use the tunnels .
I wonder how many of my pensioners will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he was unable to answer this question at least .
`` The four doctors who were trained at Guy &apos;s Hospital , and in the last five years of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , he wrote in a letter , `` I am the last to live . &apos;&apos;
how many of us are we going to do ?
Andrew Law@@ son has been diagnosed with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om at the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 February he was 5@@ 5th .
this was an unusually long survival time .
fifty percent of all Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om@@ gens die within 8 months after the diagnosis .
the disease always ends .
so we can only repeat what many of us are going to do . &apos;&apos;
Britain &apos;s leading experts to Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , Professor Julian Pe@@ to , assume that between 1870 and 2050 , if the Indonesian epidemic is expected to be brought to a halt in the United Kingdom , a total of 9@@ ,000 of the disease will be lost .
most of them still have no idea of dying .
an asbestos mine in Quebec , Canada
a short view of the files of the courts to which the people concerned are often dealing with claims of damages shows how far the scourge of the Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms is already spread .
in June this year , Marks &amp; Spencer , for example , had to be exposed to asbestos .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 .
Mrs. Allen was 18 years ago when she started her work at M &amp; S .
now she has two children in the kenn@@ el .
`` Before this , she said , `` I never heard of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om that I still did n&apos;t know really about asbestos .
I never thought that would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos does not relate to substance but to a group of six minerals .
the name stems from the word `` asynchron@@ al form , &apos;&apos; a description of the fibre structure which makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in construction .
Chr@@ y@@ so@@ til , also known as white asbestos , is now far from having found the most common asbestos in buildings .
it has been used for roof boards , floor plates , pipe insul@@ ations , drilling insulation and even for braking surfaces in cars .
however , it is less deadly than other forms of asbestos , but it is considered to be a `` big health risk &apos;&apos; of possible deaths from the EU and the WHO .
however , it is more dangerous than the brown asbestos and the blue asbestos -LRB- Kro@@ ky@@ do@@ li@@ th -RRB- .
the United Kingdom was once the world &apos;s largest importer , and experts suspect that `` it was clear but indirect that this was a main reason for the uniquely high Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om@@ rats . &apos;&apos;
a staff of Marks &amp; Spencer was held at the flagship store in Oxford Street , London , asbestos .
Jan@@ ice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om@@ kari , but the work of Julian Pe@@ to suggests that their history is by no means unusual .
he has presented a study of those who have been affected , in what is said `` a significant proportion of the Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ ome was caused by work in the environment without a known suspension through work or in the home . &apos;&apos;
most of these contacts are based on the `` normal use and aging &apos;&apos; of our buildings .
it looks like no one can expect to be secure .
a report by God@@ dard Consulting , which studied the Palace of Westminster , shows how people could have been exposed to the substance in the hearts of the government .
in 2009 , God@@ dard reported that the services of the services and the pipelines had been contaminated by Parliament &apos;s comitology with asbestos whose lethal fibres could be confiscated by something as harmless as `` strong air movements . &apos;&apos;
parliamentarians are often accused of dealing with their own interests , but this is where the opposite is concerned .
while the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Western Royal Palace has received a `` clean health certificate &apos;&apos; , it is now undisputed that 1 billion of more than several years of work must be paid over several years to renov@@ ate Parliament to modernise electric installations and remove the asbestos , and that , after the general election , the Members will meet at the nearby Q@@ E@@ 2 conference as on the green benches in Westminster
the God@@ dar@@ d report also pointed out that `` the presence of asbestos was not carried out in accordance with the respective provisions . &apos;&apos;
no one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
everything you can do is waiting .
one person who has never seen contact with asbestos was Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t , a general medical doctor .
like Andrew Law@@ son , the 50-@@ year-old Ab@@ bot@@ t predicted that he had been exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
`` I have worked in a hospital in which asbestos was decided , &apos;&apos; but I can not prove in my case
it is so difficult to recall all the places where one has worked .
what he has just reminded us is the day at the beginning of December 2009 , where he got such a fever .
he was 45 , and he had carried out late in the evening .
suddenly I had to kill frost .
it suddenly came .
I felt terrible .
I thought they no longer want to go to the home .
as a doctor he knew that the pain from the chest of the skin caused the skin to go around .
but , like Jan@@ ice Allen , he had no reason to suspect Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om .
he did not go to work a month .
doctors made X-ray recordings of his chest and set Ple@@ ur@@ ak@@ ath@@ e@@ ther to see liquid and test in the laboratory .
however , his complaints remained without diagnosis .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his workplace .
however , from time to time , the symptoms returned back , often returning to sporting activity and strong breathing .
in 2011 there was a diagnosis of similar symptoms in his practice , having later been diagnosed with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om .
however , this is not the case with his own case .
after all , his patient had several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
the connection in the case was clear .
in September 2011 , Ab@@ bot@@ ts continued to deteriorate and his parent doctor brought his CT@@ -S@@ scan and X-ray recording to a group group .
in December 2011 , exactly two years later , after the first time , a camera equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the reef and the chest .
I am an optim@@ ist .
often I do just , &apos;&apos; he says .
to be honest , I did not have so many worries .
but Rachel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of biop@@ sy was during the week between Christmas and New Year : `` I said it was Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om . &apos;&apos;
Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t : diagnosis Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om
suddenly Ab@@ bot@@ t had deadlines with Mac@@ mil@@ lan@@ -@@ nurses , some of whom recommended to take a lawyer .
it is only now that it is the scale of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was widespread , especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated by asbestos . &apos;&apos;
the people who had been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering .
and thus Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om now meets younger people who did not work in the typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes in hospitals under the earth , so , patients have probably not been exposed to the substance .
but many of the staff who took part in pedestrian areas -LRB- such as Andrew Law@@ son -RRB- or in underground cant@@ ons -LRB- as Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t often did -RRB- have had the greatest potential in contact with the toxic substances .
it shows that several decades after the war of hospitals for patients could have been life-@@ saving , but life-@@ threatening for the doctors who have been treated .
he is still being removed .
students put on their farms on the top of the coast .
and it concerns not only hospitals .
asbestos has frequently been used in offices , shops , libraries and urban areas because of its superb insulation and flame retar@@ dant properties .
there are also schools .
indeed , many people have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
in all of the country , in thousands of chemical customers , students have turned to asynchron@@ ous mats .
asbestos in schools is frequently mentioned on websites .
and meanwhile so innocent items are included in our houses such as floor plates or floors in accordance with asbestos .
`` It is a industri@@ alist that is included in large parts of our real estate , &apos;&apos; commented Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew Law@@ son in his trial against Guy &apos;s Hospital .
in one case the only contact that fell to the woman concerned was the dismantling of a garden mill in the 1970s .
so you can adjust how to turn off your gardens .
the effects of the diagnosis and the knowledge that the disease is incur@@ able is immense .
`` It takes a while to process , &apos;&apos; says Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t .
I went back to work and I tried to go further , but I noticed that I could not concentrate on what I did .
I have been in practice for two weeks .
then I knew I go and had to look after myself .
yes , I am not going to see another Christmas .
the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to one of patients .
like countless patients before him , he remembers how he was of all the information he had to come to .
`` It was very difficult to record everything , &apos;&apos; he said .
`` I asked my doctor `` how long did I have ? &apos;&apos;
and there were about 12 months .
I remember that I thought `` Na me , that I will not see another Christmas .
that was what happened . &apos;&apos;
Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is particularly insi@@ dious because it is our life-@@ management mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer .
most cases of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om are caused by asynchron@@ ous contact .
asbestos consists of smallest fibres .
when the asbestos is confiscated and the fibres are inhal@@ ed , they can be fixed in the chest of the skin around the lungs .
asynchron@@ ous fibres irrit@@ ate the chest skin and can trigger cell mut@@ ations .
`` The problem arises with the visually shaped asynchron@@ ous fibres , `` Professor Tom Treas@@ ure , a heart Thor@@ ax doctor who moved to the Guy &apos;s Hospital in 2001 .
exactly the hospital from which Andrew Law@@ son is suspected of facing the asbestos is now , ironically , a leading centre in the treatment of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om .
Treas@@ ure knew Law@@ son and treated some others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their education at hospital .
as soon as the asynchron@@ ous tissue reaches the lung tissue , Treas@@ ure says that they are pressed from the respiratory tract to the edge where the skin is .
from nature it is from the beginning of inv@@ asi@@ v .
the usual options in other cancers do not work at Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om .
the effectiveness of an operation , for example , is very controversial .
some think they were worth trying .
Treas@@ ure denies this .
`` He can not cut the skin &apos; he says him
they do not come to the knife .
meanwhile the cancer `` on chem@@ otherapy , does not speak very well , `` the effect shows , but not .
`` sometimes there are long-term over@@ living , &apos;&apos; says Treas@@ ure .
but at the end of the day they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author Stephen Jay G@@ ould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
two years after his own diagnosis , Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t is still struggling .
after contacting Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , Ab@@ bot@@ t appeared in contact with Andrew Law@@ son , the four years after his diagnosis .
`` hello , cancer of cancer &apos;&apos; said he was happy about calls .
`` He was very positive , &apos;&apos; said Ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had received his diagnosis for 4 years and was still very active .
originally , Ab@@ bot@@ t had been offered six chem@@ otherapy cycles that would take four months and expected to extend his life by one month .
`` I was desperate , &apos;&apos; he says .
I wanted to give up .
Law@@ son , however , managed to make things appear in something more positive . &apos;&apos;
after consulting several doctors , Ab@@ bot@@ t decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Lo@@ ic Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ dark@@ ski .
`` We had an advantage that I did not need to be referred to , I simply wanted to go and I got an appointment , `` I have been saying .
a normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of treatment .
money is crucial to Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om sufferers in order to be able to perform the best available therapies .
but if these treatments fail to fail , many are concerned by other financial concerns - the future of the families that they leave .
and thus they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Law@@ son contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Water@@ house LL@@ P .
`` It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health , &apos;&apos; Morgan says .
but what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that there was also a very low burden on the risk of health .
and here the negligence of companies began to play .
Andrew Law@@ son and Guy &apos;s Hospital eventually submitted their case , but it was not what Morgan was called `` full compensation , &apos;&apos; because Law@@ son could not prove with absolute certainty , his Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was due to an asynchron@@ ous contact in the guy .
after the investigation into his death , a spokesman of the guy confirmed that `` the asynchron@@ ous fibres were removed from the 1990s in the 1990s . &apos;&apos;
this was too late for Andrew Law@@ son .
how asbestos can be removed
indeed , it is a huge problem for Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om sufferers who seek compensation , a huge problem that includes fatal contact between a company or a workplace - decades after the incidents .
many of their previous employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who stand against claims know that the time is for them , but certainly not with the plain@@ tiff .
as a response to this , this year clear new legislation , which makes it easier for Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om to intervene , also makes it impossible to compensate , even if their former employers are no longer able to find themselves .
the law has provided 350 million tonnes of funds from the insurance industry to all who were diagnosed after July 2012 .
in these cases , the plain@@ tiff will receive 80 % of what a court could have brought to them in a normal compensation process - about 120@@ ,000 .
some 300 successful applications in the program are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om stakeholders that 350 million £ was a very good work of the insurance industry .
`` This is a deal of insurers for insurers , &apos;&apos; he says .
it was also possible to announce that the law was not perfect .
but both like Morgan said that rapid action is needed in the face of seven death casualties .
`` People are suffering so much , and they need help today during the second hearing of the Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om Act in December of last year .
at this point , Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t has been in the hands of Prof. Lo@@ ic Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ dark@@ ski for 19 months .
after her first discussions , Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ dark@@ ski recommended an operation from which he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treas@@ ure .
this has been accompanied by radiation therapy and chem@@ otherapy .
Ab@@ bot@@ t felt stronger .
`` This is , of course , most important , &apos;&apos; says Ab@@ bot@@ t .
this is always seen in patients .
there is something that makes you go on .
if you look at it , it &apos;s very fast .
Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t suspended the operation in March 2012 .
at the end of August he had the last of six chem@@ otherapy cycles .
subsequent scans showed no evidence of the disease .
then I got a scan in March 2014 .
there were several cancers around my chest .
I have been 50 .
this is not life-@@ threatening .
this is a matter of life .
once again , Ab@@ bot@@ t moved to six chem@@ otherapy cycles .
now no trace of the tum@@ ors is more visible .
but the process is physically and mentally very demanding .
they have to think of practical things - money when I &apos;m not more , or , for example , the way in which the ball schedule works .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they need to look ahead .
as father of El@@ lie , 16 , and Tam@@ sin , 14 , this is not always easy .
`` For parents this is hard , &apos;&apos; says he .
it is hard to know what to say and how much .
when I received my first diagnosis , I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not be old .
they reacted differently .
Tam@@ sin is very soci@@ able and very uncomfortable .
she told her friends and we soon got very many calls .
El@@ lie was more cautious .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that need to be carried out by all cancer patients .
but for Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om@@ gens such talks are not of hope , not of a trace of hope for survival .
the disease -LRB- as long as Stephen Jay G@@ ould -RRB- brings a lack of safety .

China is refusing to attack Hong Kong .
on Sunday , in spite of the increased calls for democratic reforms , the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the elections for 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate .
this was probably the long awaited protests in Hong Kong &apos;s business district , while activists in activists are holding the way into the way .
the decision of the People &apos;s Congress allows Communist leaders , in principle , to draw up all the candidates that they do not want .
`` This is not unexpected but it makes us angry , &apos;&apos; said legal expert expert , Emil@@ y L@@ au , Chairman of the Democratic Party .
this was not what Beijing had promised .
the inhabitants of Hong Kong were caught .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
in his defense of the Chinese decision , Li F@@ ei , Vice President of the Permanent Committee of the National Council , said that the approval of public nominations would be ` chaotic &apos; .
since 1997 , when the United Kingdom returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese , Beijing promised to elect the residents from 2017 .
the Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong direct voting rights , but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership retains the implementation of an area closely controlled by Beijing .
according to a new clause , only candidates should be admitted with love to the country and love to Hong Kong .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most famous protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for many years .
behind the pro-@@ democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Movement of Occup@@ y Central With Love and Peace , whose organizers threatened to liberate the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine common right of voting .
on Sunday evening , within a few hours after the announcement , hundreds of Occup@@ y-@@ centric supporters in the rain had gathered before the state of government in Hong Kong .
at the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobe@@ dience and that they had planned in the weeks of protest in the coming weeks .
however , they did not make any further information , apparently to prevent problems with the authorities .
in an on-line communication , the organizers concluded that the movement of the central district was only considered to be the last resort , an action that should only take place if all dialogue possibilities are exhausted and no other option .
we are sorry to have to say that today all the dialogue has been exhausted and that the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place .
the authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for days on the announcement of Beijing , and security measures on Sunday in front of the government buildings have been covered by police forces and barri@@ cades .
the riots are exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the supply of people from the mainland reinforces competition for products and services .
moreover , fear that Hong Kong &apos;s values will begin as democracy and freedom of speech under the growing pressure of Beijing is growing .
some criticised the demonstrations of the Occup@@ ational Zone movement because they are vulnerable to the business - the life of Hong Kong .
`` The protests from which they speak could cause major economic harm , depending on how many they are involved and how long they continue .
we do not want to see Hong Kong using control .
this impression is bad for investment .
China &apos;s state-@@ controlled media recently reported about the democracy activists in Hong Kong as part of Western powers .
in this summer , activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights that participated in 78@@ ,000 people - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
in July tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region .
the tradition of secondary school flights in the US is now transferred to universities , where they are offered to private aircraft .
we are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the first luxury travel service for students of today .
in order to achieve an especially impressive presence at the university , the company also offers transportation services such as private aircraft , Rol@@ ric Phantom , Aston Mar@@ ten or Mc@@ Laren P1 .
Mr Stewart also said that the service had a security problem .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who , otherwise , would have to se@@ w their seeds through the land through the land .
together with our new V@@ IF options we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury .
a member of the company said that no new bookings were found because the service had just been introduced , adding that `` students would book the service in the next weeks . &apos;&apos;
the company also informed the fact that , despite the studies of more than 9,000 per year , there is a market for this offer .
students today differ very much from the students from 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years - it &apos;s more important than ever to make a great impression , and with VI@@ F you can do exactly .
the National Student Union , however , criticized the service as something they did .
Meg@@ an Dunn , Vice-President of the N@@ US for higher education , said : `` This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students .
many students who begin this month by studying are faced with a crisis of life costs , as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and grants does not stop with the highly increased calculations for the most simple conditions of life before they can think at all about spending thousands of pounds for something more than the arrival in the student residence .
femin@@ ists criticise racial issues and police behaviour after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
the un@@ armed teenagers were killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
the participants raised their hands into the air and s@@ ages , `` hands high , not shoot , &apos;&apos; `` while they waited before the funeral .
after two weeks of protests in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mon , because of the killing of the un@@ armed teen@@ ager Michael Brown , the blog Mi@@ ri@@ am Zo@@ ila Per@@ ez noticed a change in the online discussion of white femin@@ ists .
according to their experience , white feminist commentators place gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequality .
however , while tensions in the Middle West rose and met all over the country , Per@@ ez saw that the answers of white women became 100 % around the race .
in comparison to the answers of black women , shortly after the shots of the 9th August , the personal essays with titles such as the idea of F@@ erg@@ us@@ on by a white woman and `` feminism does not just look at the suppression of women `` relatively late .
but for Per@@ ez this meant an important change .
`` I do not believe there is a lot of people in feminism who speak about the white , and privileges speak in so high class , &apos;&apos; she said .
people felt compelled to express something about the incidents .
it is characteristic of the crisis in which we are , because the situation in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is so ethn@@ ically that they must express that .
for English professors of Cori@@ tha Mitchell from Ohio State University , F@@ erg@@ us@@ on brought problems to light that are exposed to black American people every day but are not regarded as `` women &apos;s party &apos;&apos; in the cultural area .
`` I can publish something on Facebook about me and my partners and I get 150 li@@ kes from everywhere , &apos;&apos; said Mitchell .
when I see something about how farms in their own country are under siege , silence is st@@ ony .
`` How can women be sure to speak publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? &apos;&apos; asked .
for black women such as Mitchell , the race , gender and sexuality in the history of the United States , there is no dich@@ ot@@ etic between racial and gender problems .
for them , black women did not have the luxury to separate the subjects ; they are living every day in the combined reality .
while white women now link the topic of race and gender to feminist mainstream circles , Angela H@@ last@@ y , Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mas@@ on University , says that its predecessors did the opposite .
`` at least 10,000 black men have been released and the explanatory statement was almost always the rape of a white woman , `` said H@@ last@@ y .
white women had to be involved in history to justify the Lyn@@ ch@@ killing .
for H@@ last@@ y , the division between white and black women came to the point where white fighters analysed the country in the late 19th century of the 19th century and found that the fight for the right to vote could only succeed for each group : women or Black .
`` You met the decision to work for the right of women , and the right of election to black should come later , `` said H@@ last@@ y .
if you remember such things , one of power becomes aware of why coloured women do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women to protect their hus@@ bands and sons .
even after receiving the right to vote in 1920 , it still took a decade for white women to be organised against the Lyn@@ chen in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lyn@@ ching .
the group was founded almost 40 years after the original request for help from pages of black women .
for Mitchell , the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by F@@ erg@@ us@@ on - police behavior , racial discrimination - a mirror of the time in which white femin@@ ists played with the problems with which black women have been involved in generations for generations .
`` would it not be great if the activist activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to educating a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception ? &apos;&apos;
femin@@ ists of the second generation who built up their career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to preferential treatment of funds are now trying to understand what that means .
the famous white feminist activist Gloria St@@ einer went to Facebook for two weeks and published an important article by Reb@@ ecca Car@@ roll , the writer of the Guardian , in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism .
`` I hope that women who have another reason but a parallel for that have the danger of understanding one of the body - and opinions on the race that are very different in public surveys - the changes , `` wrote St@@ one .
some of their comments on the racial issue in America are , despite the fact that they are mentioned in the field of inter@@ sec@@ tional feminism , while racial and gender issues are mentioned .
Christina Sommer , a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` Who of femin@@ ism ? &apos;&apos; said to the People that young men in the United States , especially young coloured men , `` far more vulnerable than their sisters , `` but stone remarks to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on are in contrast to their previous criticism .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing exists for boys .
but when the White House recently set up a small program , My Brother &apos;s Ke@@ eper program , to help vulnerable young black and his@@ panic men , there were acute reactions of many femin@@ ists , including Gloria St@@ einer .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is pressing into the mainstream feminist .
as the US border police took over almost 6@@ 3,000 un@@ attended minors at the southern border of the country this year , the issue of immigration reform is once again to the surface - this time as a woman &apos;s policy .
Andrea Merc@@ ado , co-@@ chairman of We Bel@@ ong , a organization that mobili@@ zed women for immigration reform , said that as a key woman of women she merely had to publish the stories of migrant women .
`` These speak for themselves , &apos;&apos; said Merc@@ ado .
when the large majority of money visas to male immigrants are concerned , the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories can be found in the women &apos;s organisations , &apos;&apos; said she .

the SW@@ City Harvey , according to Lot@@ to@@ win , has become a new million@@ aire .
a pilot player from Harvey is this month .
the search for a new million@@ aire in the southwest of Perth lasts , with a happy winner , who receives $ 1.1 million from flying on Saturday .
for the second time in five years , a newspaper kiosk in Harvey took the jackpot in the drawing of the first division , after $ 1 million in November 2009 .
however , the happy winner must continue to report .
the shop owner Steve said that the profit for talk of talk was carried out in the small city in the southwest of Perth .
the city is talking about nothing , and everyone is pretty excited .
we thought that could happen .
eight W@@ A-@@ winners celebrated profits in the first division last month , concluding for a few happy weeks for the players in the state .
last week a player from Cann@@ ing became one of the five million@@ aires in August after a married couple from Bel@@ mont only had reached the mega-@@ profit of 7.5 million .
the winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the profit would allow them to travel to the world and purchase a new house .
the million@@ aire is the 5@@ 9th winner of the first division in the WA in this year , with a total of almost 85 million .
Le@@ oni@@ das asked to the Bl@@ essed Arena .
it was not only the owners who stood at Mat@@ sch at the first Rhein@@ bach Roman day in the outdoor park .
however , the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract yesterday to more than 1000 visitors who have failed to withstand the rain of the rain and brought to light from the historical spectacle .
there were a variety of performances , performances , games , exhibition halls and information about the history of the Romans and its importance to the Rhin@@ eland .
the main attraction of the day was , of course , the mar@@ ti@@ al fighters who used to demonstrate their robust combat art in the arena with soft sand .
the owner `` Le@@ oni@@ das &apos;&apos; proved to be humorous and expert .
first of all , the `` Pro@@ vo@@ cat@@ ers &apos;&apos; were on the side of a rectangle and a short distance to the left .
it has been followed by the `` Es@@ ed@@ ari@@ i &apos;&apos; with chest plate , short weight and hose as well as iron .
particularly impressive was the appearance of the `` Retiro &apos;&apos; which entered into the field of `` Sec@@ utor &apos;&apos; and recently fought the bur@@ gues .
because of the strength of the heavy metal , the turtles and the trunk , the scene flows through the arena that fear and ban@@ ge could become the health of gla@@ zers .
however , the imposing `` Sum@@ ma Ru@@ dis &apos;&apos; , the mus@@ cul@@ ous arbitr@@ ator , had an attentive eye .
`` We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and the culture of the Roman period make it possible , &apos;&apos; explained Lorenz Eus@@ kirchen , Chairman of the organizers of `` Friends of the Roman Channel , &apos;&apos; the intention behind the spectacle .
after two years of preparation the area of the park has become an old city of art .
after all , the Romans not only brought war and conquest to the region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire .
the remains of these were also seen at the Roman Day , for example `` Aqu@@ ä@@ gen-@@ marble &apos;&apos; from the eleven meters of high and 1400 meters long Roman Channel Bridge , which once stood at ventilation .
the Fron@@ tin@@ us society once turned to water and energy , and now knew Petra Fri@@ cke knew : `` We are still making use of the knowledge of the then . &apos;&apos;
this also confirms graduate engineers from the engineering team from Rhein@@ bach , the founding instruments of the Romans such as Chor@@ ob@@ at , Gro@@ ma or Di@@ op@@ tra .
the Roman villa in Blan@@ ken@@ heim represented the designs and models of the excavations , and bricks from the original hypo@@ ther@@ est , the most hot of the Roman villa .
it was also impressive to leave the foot@@ prints that had been left by Wolf and Fuchs two years ago .
in 2011 , the Court of the Federal Republic of Germany ruled the remains of a Roman villa in the industrial park of Nord in Rhein@@ bach .
the walls of an economic building were reached by means of drying up from cereals and to mice .
the building is likely to be a Villa Rus@@ tica , an agricultural property that explained the Archaeological Institute of Dr. Jennifer Mor@@ ache .
a number of finds of these excavations took place in a glass of glass , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate neck .
the villa has probably existed from the early to the fourth century , until the arrival of the German@@ en in the then Roman Rhin@@ eland .
at the same time , the children also wrote to the Roman gre@@ yhound game , similar to the present today , as the Roman students once wrote their names with metal chips .
at the stand of the Roman winds the children were allowed to set themselves at the stand of the glass museum of the Rhine .
with the original Roman tour which had been built by two cold flowers , the visitors passed through the outdoor park and came to the impressive high level of the city of Madrid , which presented here the results of their `` Rö@@ mer project tournaments . &apos;&apos;
with a Roman Week of 13 to 21 September , the Municipality of Wach@@ z@@ berg will also participate in the Rhine region of Gdansk , which is supposed to be remembered at the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago .
in cooperation with the homeland and historical circles , as well as the watch@@ party of the region of Ober@@ bach@@ em , there will be thematic hikes , a lecture , cooking evenings and guided tours of school classes , as well as the history of the Roman past .
for example , a Roman leg@@ ion@@ aire from his work on the ran@@ ch of wax tells us that plants are presented as living thinking of the Roman times and have become a funny lesson in the field of international understanding between a group of leaders of Germany and the Romans .
as part of the project I am dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project of projects .
with the Roman Week , the numerous but often visible traces of the Romans will continue to be seen at the first glance of the Romans .
there will be a small presentation to the Fund of the Ber@@ cum@@ er Mat@@ ron@@ en@@ hei@@ lig@@ ae in 1879 .
Eb@@ ola : the epidemic of Western Africa
the oil epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies go from distance .
the devastating oil epidemic is a serious blow to the economy of Western Africa .
the harvest rot@@ ates on the fields that are left , and the markets have been orphaned .
some international companies also go from distance .
`` The EIB epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic , &apos;&apos; the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kab@@ aliz@@ ka .
Liberia is hardest
`` It &apos;s a total disaster we lose very much money , &apos;&apos; says Al@@ ha@@ ji Bam@@ ogo , the second largest market in the capital of Mon@@ ro@@ via clothing .
on the market , only those who want to buy food or disinfection want to buy against Eb@@ ola .
Liberia was hit hardest by the virus ; here there were more than 600 people here .
recently , the health authorities declared that the disease had occurred in every corner of the country .
in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria , the virus has spread .
more than 1500 people , thousands of others , died .
foreign companies attract employees
anywhere in the resource-@@ rich countries , companies rely on their operations .
foreign companies such as the Arcel@@ or Mittal draw their employees , and several international airlines no longer fly into the regions concerned .
locals and farmers also react : few traders still leave their homes to recover .
in some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia , which are under quarantine , there is the possibility of scrapping among others the most important cocoa and coffee beans on the fields .
farmers do not dare to leave their homes .
food is scarce
`` People will always travel less , &apos;&apos; says Phil@@ li@@ pe De V@@ re@@ yer , Parisian expert for the economy of West Africa .
the man , for example , who normally goes to the market and sells its vegetables , prefers to stay at home .
the population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently : food is becoming scarce .
on the markets , stocks of basic foods such as rice are disappearing .
at the same time , the region heavily linked to international firms is threatening an image - with far-reaching consequences .
the largest danger is that international firms are avoiding the area for a long time , saying Philippe H@@ ug@@ on from the French think tank Iris .
important how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors can see the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia , and thus to invest , &apos;&apos; warns H@@ ug@@ on .
the disease is also burdened by the countries that have been subjected to national budgets .
the disease also affects the already hard-@@ pressed state budgets of the states concerned .
Moody &apos;s rating agency fears that their budgets are pushed sharply from the high expenditure on the healthcare system and from the worsening economy .
the African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $ 60 million -LRB- EUR 45 million -RRB- .
the effects are already felt in Nigeria , where only a few have been diagnosed .
the oil-@@ rich region of the southern Niger Delta has not been affected .
but elsewhere , many people remain afraid of infection at home .
reservations in hotels are also clear .

Charles of March and Adolf Ri@@ ed led the club as the head of the foundation of a difficult starting time , in which it was mainly supposed to find a club locally and install the shooting operation .
already in the autumn of 1965 the patron of the patron started to compete with two teams with two teams .
in the subsequent years the sports protection , which has been organised in seven teams , was established in all classes up to the 1st Gau@@ k .
at the first time in 1980 Rudi Meier made the title of the Association of Pur@@ zel@@ ten .

after a work of 27@@ 00 hours , on the 8th of May 1988 , Bishop Strasser granted the church blessing to the new guards .
one of the main highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 4@@ 4th Gau@@ shoot , linked to the solemn wisdom of the new Treas@@ ures in July 1991 .
on 23 and 24 April 1994 the Association of Directors celebrated its 30-@@ year anniversary .
1995 was founded in 1995 .
Josef Rand@@ z@@ l was a member of the European Union .
a major challenge for the Bon and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Bon meeting in 2005 .
in many hours of voluntary work , the members of the board have modernized the premises and the shooting facilities at the Bern@@ g@@ auer Hof last year and thus brought the technology to date .

in addition to shooting , there are events such as Bo@@ ck@@ dle , Ivory ry and Royal Ball .
in this way they are also responsible for the festivities in the parish church and the municipality .
Tony Stewart suffers from returning to the race .

no long after the second accident Ste@@ war@@ ts was loaded and the team had packed and was ready to continue .
Stewart was the first to be a member of the United States and the United States .
he decided to return this week , either in Atlanta or at the next race , to win a place in persecution .
he returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-@@ year-old Kevin W@@ ard Jr , who had gone to the driving track during a race to confront Stewart .
the authorities passed on Friday that the investigation will continue to last at least two weeks on the cause of the accident .
no decision has yet been taken to see whether Stewart has to insist on charges .

with more ac@@ tives , the whole thing would do more fun , `` you could dance very different chore@@ ographies , &apos;&apos; she says .
if you want to dance , Thurs@@ days from 17 to 18 pm or Friday can be arranged from 17 to 6.30 p.m. in the dance sport at the former Hotel Meyer , Frei@@ straße 9 , without obligation in the hour of the course .

NATO does not want agreements with Russia
as a result of the Ukrainian crisis , NATO is not going to break its agreement with Russia as a result of the Ukrainian crisis .
NATO Secretary of State said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is based on the founding agreement of the NATO Council of NATO in 1997 .
the leader of NATO , however , accused Russia of `` a blatant passage &apos;&apos; of the agreement .
`` Today we have to face up to the fact that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner , &apos;&apos; Rasmussen .
documents and opinions from the Russian side show that they consider us to be opponents . &apos;&apos;
increasing NATO
Rasmussen has also announced that we want to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe .
one of the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that `` we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary , &apos;&apos; Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday .
Kiev and Moscow in some of the new gas talks
according to the official figures , Russia and Ukraine agreed on new talks on the settlement of their gas strike .
the negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday , the Russian Energy Minister , Alexander No@@ wa@@ k , on Monday .
it is still waiting for a decision of the European Union whether it would also send a representative to the talks .
because of the dispute over the gas price , Ukraine has had no fuel from Russia for weeks .
last but not least , EU energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger has been given access to both sides between the two sides .
Ukraine had warned , and Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe .
Europe refers to a third of its natural gas from Russian sources , some of which go through Ukraine .
Merkel speaks the word of power : toll will be `` very clear &apos;&apos;
now , once again , the Chancellor once again acknowledges this .
however , a free letter for all complicated details is not .
persistent concerns from the CDU against the toll of cars have made the CSU increasingly vulnerable .
Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of ongoing opposition from its CDU a power of power for the introduction of passenger tolls .
`` to say very clearly : it is in the coalition agreement and it will come , &apos;&apos; said the party leader on Monday to meetings of the CD@@ U in Berlin .
on a detailed model , however , Merkel failed to do so .
certain parameters are called `` certain parameters &apos;&apos; in the black@@ -@@ red government programme .
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dob@@ rin@@ dt -LRB- CSU -RRB- did ` a proposal made , and this is going to be done now . &apos;&apos;
however , the NR@@ W CDU insists on its no toll on all roads .
Merkel , too , the Finance Minister of Wolfgang Schä@@ uble -LRB- CDU -RRB- made a constructive contribution to the discussions on a draft law .
in addition , he has talked to Dob@@ rin@@ dt about other possibilities of activating more private capital for investment in infrastructure , for example on broadband .
`` There is nothing special about this , and on Sunday the `` Mirror &apos;&apos; of the report had not made any comments , let his house test his own concept of paying airport investors with toll revenue - after the election of 2017 .
at the same time , CS@@ U leader Horst Seeh@@ ofer warned us to develop in the cabinet of tolls against the competent minister .
CD@@ U-@@ Def@@ vi@@ ze Ar@@ min Laschet confirmed his objections .
`` The coalition agreement never went from painting all round and federal roads , &apos;&apos; said the North Rhin@@ eland of the Channel .
in this respect , it is an important signal that hake has now announced the debate on the subject .
resistance to the plans is also evident from the CD@@ U@@ land departments of Baden-Württemberg and Rhin@@ eland .
the background is that there is a shortage of small border traffic to neighbouring countries .
because of the toll criticism from ranks of the CDU coalition , Seeh@@ ofer had demanded .
the Left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union .
`` The Mur@@ k@@ s-@@ toll is dead , &apos;&apos; said party leader , Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger , of the `` New Zealand Week &apos;&apos; -LRB- Monday -RRB- .
`` With the toll the minister will fail , &apos;&apos; said Dob@@ rin@@ dt , who wants to introduce a ban on all German roads that should start 2016 .
however , according to the coalition agreement , domestic car owners must not be burdened with a coalition agreement .
that is why they are supposed to receive full compensation for the tax on cars .
however , the model must not penalise foreign drivers because of their nationality because of their nationality .
genetic disorder often mis@@ diagnosed
a bri@@ e said that she thought as a result of a mis@@ diagnosis of many years that they would die .
Karin Rod@@ gers almost lived in the belief that they had few years to live after they had been diagnosed with another disease .
they actually suffered from the Char@@ cot@@ -@@ Mar@@ ie@@ -T@@ oo@@ th disease -LRB- CM@@ T -RRB- - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the back .
Char@@ ity CM@@ T UK announced that mis@@ diagno@@ ses are a frequent problem with CM@@ T people because so little is known about this disease .
about 23@@ ,000 people in the United Kingdom are likely to suffer from CM@@ T , which can lead to motor problems such as muscle weakness .
the disease is omin@@ ous and persistent ; the disease is worse than the time .
when Rod@@ gers was 13 , she believed that she would like to go to the cemetery of A@@ tax@@ ie -LRB- FA -RRB- .
he thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she had 18 and died before her 30th birthday .
the mother of two children who have been 51 years old said : `` As a child I knew I could not do the same as the others .
I constantly fell and all of me took longer .
I never had to ride with the other children , or I was going to go to school because of my way to go .
he said that at the age of 13 , after several operations in granting the discharge of their ranks 13 years , they saw when their doctor had left the room and read that they had suffered from FA .
`` I felt guilty because I was curious , so I did not tell anyone , but I went home , went to the library in the library and wrote to the F@@ A-@@ Society , `` she said .
when I received the answer , I was fascinated and I was going to panic .
I thought I would be with 18 in a wheelchair , and with 25 , and slowly all my abilities would lose .
I did everything alone with me and I planned my own funeral .
she said when she was 17 , she became aware that her abilities had not decreased as strongly as they had imagined and asked her doctor .
he was simple , and did me , and I said `` my love , I do not think you have , otherwise you &apos;re already in a wheelchair . &apos;&apos;
I think you have a little less life-@@ threatening .
according to some genetic tests , the CM@@ T was established .
`` When he told me what CM@@ T was , I felt as if I was a winner , &apos;&apos; she said .
Char@@ ity CM@@ T UK has started a CM@@ T release month to draw attention to this disease .
since the closure of the former military , he has been working as fire workers since the closing of the former military .
for less than ten years there has no longer been a shot on the former occupation area in Mün@@ singen .
despite this , any month of ammunition at the heart of the bio@@ sphere still appears at the heart of the bio@@ sphere of Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b .
the gran@@ ules are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be made on the ground .
at the heart of the bio@@ sphere there is also the centre of the bio@@ sphere at the heart of the bio@@ sphere .
in December 2004 , the last sharp shot fell on the occupation of Mün@@ singen , which was concluded after 110 years of military operation after 110 years .
since this time , the 6@@ 500 hectares of area is the cornerstone of the bio@@ sphere of Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b , which is open to 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists .
tax burden of business people in the area of Washington increases with economic recovery .
recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local taxes for companies in the country rose slightly in the last year , while economic recovery accelerated , thus a new study in the last week , and firms in Washington did not form an exception .
companies in the area of District , Michigan and Virginia paid 27.@@ 6 billion of billions of dollars to public and local posts in the financial year of 2013 , an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the revenue of $ 26.@@ 6 billion .
the national and local tax burden of companies rose by 4.@@ 3 % last year to $ 6@@ 71 billion , compared to 3,@@ 9 % in the year , and it was the third year of growth in the aftermath of the several years of decline from 2009 to 2010 .
government taxes increased more than the local taxes , by 4.@@ 3 percent , according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst &amp; Young with the Centre for State taxation , a tax policy group .
more than half of the revenues of the District , 56 percent , come from corporate taxes , while 36 per cent of the revenue originates from companies .
at the age of 28 , Virginia achieved the lowest tax revenues from companies .
much of the increase in tax revenue is justified in a recovery of the companies of the company , telling the researchers , what led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent of this year after the three consecutive years of growth rates of less than 1 % .
while a large part of these profits came from large states such as California , New York and Texas , the process also appears to be taking place in the area of Washington .
companies in the District , Michigan and Virginia paid more than $ 10 billion to public and local real estate taxes last year compared to 9.@@ 6 billion - an increase in the course of a year by 4.2 percent .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in the increase of public and local tax revenues , as real estate taxes amount to almost more than one fifth of the tax of companies .
companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
`` This is what happens : a large part of the real estate , especially in the tax area around DC , is either in the possession of the government or of non-profit organizations who do not pay property taxes , `` said Douglas Lind@@ holm , Managing Director of the Center on State taxi .
it is therefore forced to rely on income taxes for example in order to be able to offer the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in tax revenue by companies can not be the rest of the recovery of the real estate market
the revenue of the company is also likely to recover .
companies in the region reported about income taxes at state organisations of $ 2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012 .
1 billion dollars in corporate income taxes took place , the highest amount of the region .
while the trend is heading in the same direction , the local tax burden for companies does not rise evenly to all three locations .
the entry rate in the district was equivalent to 4,@@ 3 percent of the national average , while the rise in the city was significantly higher , 4.@@ 9 percent .
it was only in Virginia that there was a secondary tax of 4.@@ 1 percent .
at 6 per cent , Virginia has significantly less business income tax -LRB- in all three of them -RRB- .
the company &apos;s tax rates are at 8.@@ 25 percent and in the district at relatively high 9.@@ 9@@ 75 percent .
a similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower state and local business taxes are required .
in the study the district was not investigated .
despite the benefits , Virginia stands under pressure from its southern neighbours .
North Carolina has passed laws on reducing its business tax in this year to 6 % , the same sentence as Virginia , and the sentence will fall to 5 % in the coming year .
if the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year , this law could reduce the state &apos;s tax rate by 2017 to 3 % .
in the meantime , it appears to be better in Washington and they thus pay more government and local taxes , according to the recent study .
business taxes that are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure after which most of the small businesses are organized - in the District , the Michigan and Virginia last year by 20 % of $ 2.4 billion , a significantly faster growth rate than the business tax as a whole .
researchers say that the trend and the increase in investment taxes throughout the country will probably continue in this year , with an increase in the general added tax revenue for the state and the local governments by 6,@@ 2 % in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year .
however , the area of Washington could lag behind if the government &apos;s spending cuts affect the employment market in the region .
partner City : German beer for Guangzhou
Hop@@ fen and Mal@@ z - also in China a popular combination .
German beer has an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt &apos;s capital city in China is now looking for a brewery and is also hoping for a flight direct connection between the two cities .
German beer , made in Frankfurt &apos;s Munich city district , is the urgent desire of officials in China .
`` We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city , &apos;&apos; said the deputy secretary of the South China metropolis , Li Yi@@ wei , this week when visiting a SP@@ D delegation in his city .
once again the role of China &apos;s ruling Communist Party has come back in this matter of this concern of the 12th million metropolis .
Guangzhou , which is named in Germany , is one of China &apos;s richest cities .
that is why people also thought of purchasing power to be able to buy German beer .
the h@@ ess@@ ical SP@@ D Chairman of Thor@@ sten Schä@@ fer Gü@@ mb@@ el , who led the German politician , said to the host that he would listen to the project in Germany according to a possible partner for the project .
`` For beer it does not need much : good water , cereals and the joy of life , &apos;&apos; he added at lunch with the party top in Guangzhou .
this joy of life has already served as Mr Li , who has been hosting the host .
as a result of this , the owners of the company came to the end of the year at the end of the 20th century .
the Chinese brand of TB goes back to German brewing art .
T@@ sing@@ ta@@ o-@@ beer is brewed according to the German quality of purity .
more commerce
the second wish of the Chinese host would be an airline direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou .
the Lufthansa had offered the flight but in 2012 it was removed from economic reasons .
`` It would be worthwhile , &apos;&apos; the local politician proved convincing .
`` commerce between our two cities continues to continue . &apos;&apos;
at the moment , travelers would have to take the way through Chang@@ sha in the province of Hun@@ an .
the administration of the province , the capital of Germany , is also hoping for air traffic .
the Deputy Governor of the province , Chen Yun@@ x@@ ian , made this wish in his talks with the Social Democrats .
`` This is a very good idea , &apos;&apos; said Schä@@ fer Gü@@ mb@@ el - the Chinese governor of Li Jin@@ ju@@ n , an intimate expert of Germany .
well-@@ maintained partnership
the le@@ ut@@ ful vice leader of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt in the next year .
Li Yi@@ wei was already on the Main , but it was not yet in this function .
he only came to office this year after his predecessor had been carried out of office because of the accusations of corruption .
the local party leader W@@ an Q@@ ing@@ lian had to go .
the action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and management , which is enforced by Head of State of Xi Jin@@ ping .
Li &apos;s new leaders had worked in front of his party career for an American company , which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China .
prior to taking office in Guangzhou , he worked as a leader in Fuj@@ ian , where the car VW built a large plant .
Frankfurt has officially taken up more than a dozen urban partnerships .
the connection to the 9000 kilometres is one of those who are cared for by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year the 25-@@ year anniversary of the German-@@ China relationship was celebrated .
the South China metropolis on the Persian border is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen .
in the next year she wanted to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion .
the family of Joan River `` expresses the thumb &apos;&apos;

`` Thank you for your continued love and support , `` Mel@@ issa River said today in a communication .
we are all pressing the thum@@ bs .

the doctors think they are deliberately se@@ under and more accurate until they are more satisfied than those who continue to be described as `` serious . &apos;&apos;

environmentally friendly vacuum cleaner and rising wages
for cars and vacuum cleaner , which come from today in trade , there will be more stringent environmental standards in the future .
like refrigerators and washing machines , new dust exchan@@ gers will be awarded from 1 September to a label on which the purchaser can see at a glance of key data such as energy efficiency of the device .
for new cars , `` Euro 6 &apos;&apos; is considered to be more stringent than nitrogen oxides .

Amazon buys T@@ Stop for € 1.@@ 04 billion .
Amazon just confirmed what information had to be reported on Monday morning : the online retailers and video generation and several other things - buying the video stream service for € 1.@@ 04 billion -LRB- 9@@ 70 million USD -RRB- .
the announcement comes surprising , not because no one expected to be taken but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would purchase the company .
three months ago it looked as if the sale of TB to the video service of Google was decided by Google for a cool billion , and cooperation also appeared of course .
T@@ ress , which was founded three years ago as Ju@@ stin@@ .@@ tv , was started as a general stream service - a live version of YouTube .
instead , it became a platform for players who wanted to publish their Bra@@ vo@@ ur@@ s in games , a YouTube for live games , &apos;&apos;
the Twitter interface .
and `` let &apos;s play , &apos;&apos; a video genre in which to play -LRB- mostly older -RRB- are already very popular on YouTube .
it is precisely that YouTube is often called to be described , so the news that YouTube was trying to buy has been recorded ; it was a textbook example of an established technology that buys potential competitors .
it is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not happen , because the company said that it was prepared to pay as much time as Amazon .
all we know at the moment is this statement by Em@@ met Kh@@ ar , President of T@@ ress : `` We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us to move faster . &apos;&apos;
another secret is honestly said to be the incredible success of T@@ Stop .
for sno@@ bs like me who explain that they prefer to do sport , it is hard to understand the attraction that is supposed to see others to play .
it is one thing to look at a friend at 3 p.m. in the morning , while through resident evil it is easy to see how he will shoot 20 times in Call of Duty in the head .
all of these games could be seen now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games today are E@@ go Games , so this can be a good recipe for headaches without having his own control .
I admit that the rapid steps in which the Roger banners of our electronic age complete all the games in record time are entertaining .
but as long as it is not a game or a virtu@@ osity in this , his Twitter channel is likely to be very interesting .
but what do sceptics like me know ?
it is called 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic .
and how do Amazon want to make money ?
it is hard to imagine that T@@ Stop is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video , which would have been easy to take YouTube .
but T@@ ress has something that each company would have liked : thousands of young men who become advertisers .
as the chairman of T@@ Stop , Sh@@ ar , said , Amazon and T@@ Stop `` believe both in the future of gaming , &apos;&apos; and the medium does not show signs of shrinking , or not even - as a donor .
at the castle of the castle there was a lot on the sunny evening .
the concept of the organisers agreed .
despite the strong rain on Saturday evening , there were an estimated 1200 of music fans to the Open Air Show in the castle garden .
at times they had to be stopped .
`` It was annoying , &apos;&apos; said Ron S@@ em , one of the organizers .
they can be found in the area of the city at the beginning of the 19th century .
out of two Spanish words , Maxim Sach@@ ra@@ j and Ron S@@ em have formed the name of Am@@ ula .
because the Open Air there is the possibility of radi@@ ating brightness on the day and in the evening through a number of shows .
well , and the fun anyway comes from alone .
this was already on the early sunny night when the first visitors made to the Open Air .
a celebration for all generations had promised the organizers .
and they did .
around the castle gardens there have been salads , but also guests from the close and other surroundings .
they followed the first live performances , they enjoyed cool drinks - in short , relaxation and enjoyment were needed .
and the corner through the generations .
while one of them was on the beach bar , the beaches of the hotel are located on the beach bar , other at a quarter of the wine in the Vin@@ othek , on the slopes which have been a big attraction for the smaller guests .
but even in the case of children , volunteers in the true sense of the word had to do all they want to become the captain and imaginative creations in the small faces .
at the same time they also worked as part of the competition at the end of the 20th century .
there was the big rain .
shortly before 5.30 p.m. he turned to the visitor , mainly looking for families .
but the attractiveness of the firm did not do so .
`` There were more people than expected , &apos;&apos; said Ron S@@ em , who spoke of a `` success around the line .
that is why there is nothing contrary to a repetition of the big party .
although the contents and sizes of the event still need to be worked , S@@ em made clear the first record on Sunday .
as annoying , he said that one had to be stopped .
apparently , the security company had been booked with too little power .
the result : some who had already paid no longer came to the terrain .
the resonance was very good .
in a first cautious estimate , the Sal@@ zw@@ edel@@ er spoke of about 1200 visitors who lived in the castle garden .
there were problems in the field of sound technology .
he also made his debut at the Academy of Music at the age of 18 .
the technicians were not able to create a relatively reasonable sound .
it was not possible to build the planned S@@ his@@ ha@@ -Lo@@ ag because the tents could not be brought to salt because of a tire of tyres .
`` In the next year they will be , &apos;&apos; the organizers will be .
the premiere of the Am@@ ul@@ a-@@ Open Air@@ s was more by the number of visitors .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organizers have made a number of mistakes that will continue to take place at the first time but must be eliminated during the second edition .
the organizers must also be criticised in the social network of Facebook .
`` sorry , but for twelve euros you simply expected to be expected , &apos;&apos; says Mel@@ anie Meier on the event page .
`` You have unfortunately taken over a bit of it , &apos;&apos; E@@ le Zimmermann says .
others do not see the initial problems very closely .
I think it is very good that some do not just be stupid but really try to put something on their legs .
it is one of the most important in the world .
now the organisers remain a year of stopping this criticism .
new Rad@@ om in Berk@@ um : Wach@@ berg &apos;s landmark
I do not think that is the case .
rather , it is waiting for the component to be used in the distinctive building .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation radar s T@@ ira is completely renewed .
the new Rad@@ om will be slightly smaller than the old of 4@@ 7.5 meters .
but the size still remains world record .
the last step to complete the new shell .
the upper part of the old shell is separated and reduced to a crane .
after that , the last quarter of the new housing is set up .
if the weather occurs , the action is to take place at the beginning of this week .

do the castle clubs soon continue to work together ?
last but not least , there was always part of the church .
now we are thinking about possible cooperation .
as an example of the reconstruction of the Wol@@ tis@@ sh@@ aus@@ er castle , the late Richard Dim@@ bath , former chairman of the Wol@@ tis@@ sh@@ aus@@ er &apos;s castle led the project in the French Gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
a year ago , there was no good climate between the Burg@@ verein and the castle of Wol@@ tis@@ shausen .
as far as possible , the views of the history of the Wol@@ bour@@ sh@@ aus@@ er Burg and possible reconstruction have so far appeared .
now the two camps are moving : discussions will soon be held on joint action .
this is confirmed by Tor@@ sten Sj@@ ö@@ berg -LRB- Burg@@ verein -RRB- and Herbert Pi@@ ff@@ l -LRB- Burgundy -RRB- at the request of our newspaper .
`` I called Mr Pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we could sit once , &apos;&apos; Sj@@ ö@@ berg reported .
it seems to me that all members of both clubs could continue to do so in the future .
that is how to be more visible .
during the castle around the late Richard Dim@@ bath , the most recent reconstruction of the mountains at the mountain forest , the castle around Sj@@ ö@@ berg is at the forefront of the area .
Herbert Pi@@ ff@@ l , Chairman of the castle friends , was very pleased about the call .
he has been a member of the castle since Dim@@ al death .
a new chairman is to be found in a member &apos;s assembly at the middle of September .
at the moment the association counts according to the 7@@ 4-@@ year-old of around 40 members .
`` After the death of my friend , Richard Dim@@ bath , we had to rest first . &apos;&apos; This term was needed to consider how it could continue . &apos;&apos;
according to Pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chairman is going to go to the meeting with the Burg@@ verein .
until then , the Burg@@ friends could also make an up-to-date mood within their group .
there is currently no candidate for the Presidency , Pi@@ ff@@ l says .
`` But I am confident that someone will find , &apos;&apos; he himself does not want to stand because he has his residence in Bad T@@ öl@@ z .
the new chair@@ person should be a cloud .
the T@@ öl@@ zer wanted to continue to participate in the project . &apos;&apos;
the different points of view of reconstruction will probably continue to exist in the eyes of Pi@@ ff@@ ls .
he appreciates Dim@@ bath as `` mission@@ ary &apos;&apos; who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar , already advanced projects , in Austria and France , would show that this idea is not air .
through a high level of involvement of the population and volunteers from all over the world , they are a tourist attraction .
Pi@@ ff@@ l : `` I was also sceptical at the beginning .
but in the course of the time I have been more and more convinced that it makes sense to advance the project .
here there is nothing else .
moreover , the project would be financed by EU subsidies , visitor tickets and potential sponsors .
`` I personally do not want to take the idea of reconstruction on board , &apos;&apos; he hopes that the Burg@@ verein might perhaps move forward on this point .
their aim to document history is important and good . &apos;&apos;
after that , we could look forward .
clever ways of saving at Uni@@ -L@@ ehr@@ books
as the cost of exchange books for many students is more than 1,000 dollars per year , the F@@ ast-@@ Two student submitted a clever austerity idea .
he found a temporary system for books of students of higher semester and offered nominal compensation to delay sales .
`` My mathematics book normally costs 180 , but I received it for $ 10 for a semester and a Ch@@ ick@@ -@@ Fil@@ -@@ A-@@ K@@ ek , `` said Schröder , 19 who visited the convention college in Georgia .
the books needed for the last semester would have cost him 430 ; he said .
he gave 120 $ .
students on average had an average of more than 1,200 per year for textbooks and study material that there would be different costs of consumption for students .
online shops and creative approaches such as the fraud are increasingly the solution to the choice of students .
the rental of textbooks becomes popular , and students can use a book for a while , often at a much lower price than at the time of purchase .
Ne@@ ebo Inc , which operates more than 250 university book@@ shops , announced that the lease of text books has doubled since 2011 .
surveys in the industry show that just a quarter of the books in the gallery shops had been rented in the last spring .
less than half of all textbooks are purchased by the trade association National Association of College stores in Camp@@ us-@@ book@@ shops .
here is the unique one for the best deals .
online Buy
some new books cost only one third of the prize for which they are in the camping book .
the ninth edition of `` Bruce &apos;s and Robert Host@@ et@@ ler &apos;s price of almost 290 -LRB- $ 290 -RRB- and Robert Host@@ et@@ ler &apos;s cost of almost 290 , can be carried out at the specialized school book@@ maker Ch@@ eg@@ g@@ .com for 23@@ 9.@@ 99 . the first of these is the first to be released .

if one of the notes of other or normal items makes no difference , used books are a good option .
for 9@@ 3,@@ 49 we have needed to have to do at Ch@@ eg@@ g@@ .com .
Matt Cas@@ a@@ day , 25 , graduation student at the Bri@@ ham Young University , says that he has spent 42 C@@ ents on Amazon@@ .com for a used output of `` Strategic Media Dec@@ ision : &apos;&apos; The Business End Of The Advertising Business . &apos;&apos;
the book was sold new to 48 .
academics like Ingrid Bra@@ c@@ ey , head of the University of Massachusetts at Am@@ her@@ st College recommended students to ask to their professors whether earlier expenditure is permissible .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest output .
except Ch@@ egg and Amazon there is also Half@@ .com of eBay Inc , a popular alternative for used books .
renting
the rental of textbooks is worth considering if you think about it and want to return to the books after completing the course .
you can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book .
for example , a student could be rented for the duration of a semester for about 20 dollars .
inform yourself of the terms and conditions of the business you rent , including charges for writing notes , sub@@ sections or utility tracks .
if you do not return the book , the sentences can even exceed the price of a new book .
E-@@ Books
E-@@ Books instead of conventional textbooks are an option .
sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a particular period of wholesalers like Amazon@@ .com , Ch@@ egg and Bar@@ nes &amp; Nob@@ le Inc. .
at Ch@@ egg it is possible to rent for six months for about 61 dollars .
Bra@@ c@@ ey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers , because many classics can be downloaded free of charge , while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive .
look at each other .
Joe Gault , 29 who will soon visit the Pep@@ per@@ dine Law School , recommends the IS@@ B@@ N number for the pricing of books , as one can be sure to find the right course .

an article of the comic film critic Rob@@ bie Coll@@ in suggests that children &apos;s films could be the reason for the lack of quality in the films themselves .
Coll@@ in named 2014 as `` the worst year &apos;&apos; for children &apos;s films and it easily described `` Dragon , as a `` functional &apos;&apos; fantasy of the game .
however , in films for a slightly older target group , it seems as if the quality of films is not necessarily the problem .
in July , Entertainment Weekly presented the average cinema scoreboard and met@@ ac@@ ri@@ tic evaluation for any summer film shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013 .
the results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year &apos;s film hits are equivalent to that of the last year .
some commentators believe that the development is due to changing image habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Net@@ fli@@ x .
director Jon F@@ av@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on dis@@ ams soon , said to the website Hollywood reporters : `` I think the times change . &apos;&apos;

in the last summer the director Steven Spiel@@ berg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics and predicting a `` core melting &apos;&apos; of Hollywood .

NATO Summit : first protests in Newport and Cardiff
at the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport .
on Saturday , hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered to an anti-@@ NATO march .
on Sunday there were some 150 people in Cardiff before the city hall in order to hold a so-called counter-@@ summit .
Stephen Fair@@ cl@@ ough has followed developments at the weekend and talked to protesters who have travelled to Belgium .
teenagers from the Blue Mountains
two young dogs were brought to safety with the cable car after they had been caught in the Blue Mountains in N@@ SW .
the 16-@@ year-old girl and the 19-@@ year-old man broke down to their tour shortly after Sunday at Sunday at G@@ ov@@ ett Le@@ ap in Black@@ he@@ ath .
concerned relatives called for about 20 : 20 : the police when the two had not returned home .
a search from local police and rescue services broke and the pair was found at about 23 .
the girl had collapsed and the man fell and had his head .
rescue forces stayed at the couple at night , and they had been flown on Monday .
they have been delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable state .
escalating anti-@@ protests in Pakistan
the around 1000 demonstrators from the P@@ TV building were pushed by soldiers from the P@@ TV building .
the station returned to a good of half an hour .
P@@ TV director Ath@@ ar Far@@ oo@@ q said that the protesters with sticks had damaged equipment in the editor .
deaths or injuries have not been reported .
the demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the heads of government to whom they voted for election .
the police , around a kilometre from the residence of the Prime Minister Na@@ wa@@ z Shar@@ if , had come from around 3,000 protesters with security forces on Monday .
according to hospital information , a policeman has been injured .
at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured as demonstrators tried to arrest Sh@@ ari@@ fs .
they want the Prime Minister to resign .
the mighty military had called on Sunday night after a meeting in the army headquarters to find a political solution to the conflict without wasting time and applying without violence . &apos;&apos;
moreover , it was said in the communication : `` the army is obliged to ensure the security of the state . &apos;&apos;
the escalation of violence has caused concern to intervention of the military , which has already had more of the past .
the protests made by the opposition politician , Im@@ ran Khan and the Pre@@ acher Tah@@ ir@@ ul , have had to take place since the Independence Day of 14 August .
Shar@@ if refuses to resign .
Khan and Qaddafi had called on their supporters on Sunday to be mut@@ ed .
`` We are not going to decline without having forced Shar@@ if to resign , &apos;&apos; said Khan .
he spoke similar .
Khan discards Shar@@ if , who won the parliamentary election in May last year .
he is calling for the resignation of central and provincial governments .
then an interim government is supposed to reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are used to protect the government district .
the demonstrators had , initially , had to survive before Parliament until Khan and Qaddafi sent them to Sh@@ ari@@ fs &apos;s residence at the weekend .
after two days of the season , H@@ flü@@ dorfer is on the table three of the tables .
with the 2 : 0 on Val Gardena , a bitter week on Sunday was brought to an end on Sunday .
`` The victory is very free , &apos;&apos; said coach Z@@ oran Bar@@ is@@ ic , whose team had reached an intermediate executive in the Europa League on Thursday .
`` The experience of success was very important , &apos;&apos;
Sch@@ ram@@ mel@@ -@@ dream brings Rapid to Sieg@@ erstraße Rapid with the second season victory the right response to the disappointment of Helsinki .
`` We wanted to show a positive reaction , &apos;&apos; said Thomas Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el , who set the course with his magnificent leadership , the 2nd of the six minute .
`` I thought I did the whole of the morning from Thursday and I put him under the bar , &apos;&apos; the 26-@@ year-old said .
as Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el on 13 November 2010 the last time in a federal state of Germany was still for Ri@@ ed .
this is why the first masterpiece in the Rap@@ id-@@ D@@ ress will continue to be remembered .
`` For me this is something very special , I am from the Rap@@ id-@@ Young , &apos;&apos; said Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el .
Mario Pa@@ vel@@ ic left Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el from the left to the right and made his cause very good .
he has enough experience of being able to exercise this position .
the gate has earned himself , he has already done some of Assad &apos;&apos; and he praised Bar@@ is@@ ic .
the team is also showing character to the 2 : 0 through Hof@@ mann after an hour that brought the decision to the decision .
after all , the guests would also be able to write .
`` I thank God for being lucky , `` Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el , who did so in the last few weeks in the last few weeks : `` The results did not vote but this was always good in comparison to the last year . &apos;&apos;
Bar@@ is@@ ic even found that `` in many games it was better than today - to `` the strongest team that has played in this stadium . &apos;&apos;
the first three-@@ point since 26 July has shown that the team structure was intact : `` Today my team has shown that it &apos;s character . &apos;&apos;
for him he also said : `` We finally had to play zero . &apos;&apos;
a lot of work during country play also the fact that with Brian B@@ ager , Mario Pa@@ vel@@ ic , Christopher Di@@ bon , Den@@ i Al@@ ar and Michael Sch@@ imp@@ els@@ berger there are several failures , and Nath@@ d@@ jan Gra@@ ho@@ vac , Stefan St@@ ang@@ l and Philipp Scho@@ bes@@ berger have made their debut debut , making the victory even more valuable .
`` It must not be forgotten , &apos;&apos; Bar@@ is@@ ic , who lost in the last three days , lost `` the most stable in recent times . &apos;&apos;
thus , the break of the country must be used to ` wounds to l@@ edges and the physical field &apos; .
one of which the break is particularly important is Captain Hof@@ mann .
he goes to the team , goes to pain .
especially at this very difficult phase , he has shown that he is a very important player for us . &apos;&apos;
Hof@@ mann did not only have the structure , but he also achieved the second gate .
it was the first match of the game since 2 November 2013 -LRB- 4 : 2 on the Count -RRB- .
Hof@@ mann `` must not believe that now everything is good , but we have certainly had a bit of luck , but at some point the happiness must also come back to us .
now it was high time , &apos;&apos; said Hof@@ mann .
however , he did not always see this as being black and white .
we did not play so badly in the last few weeks as they have been presented .
however , we must not believe that everything is good now .
the importance of his role in the team was unable to dispute .
it is a very young team , which I can help at the moment .
I do n&apos;t like to do so but I do n&apos;t want to do so .
at the same time , Michael Ba@@ ur and his crew had little to give up .
he regretted the rapid opposition from the category of spells , as well as the regular gateway of N@@ utz in the 40 minute that had been recognized unfairly by judge colleagues .
the only accusation I can do to the team is that we did not reach Tor in some phases .
there have been too few degrees .
the Ministry of Defence saw it similar : `` It has started right , but we simply found it and even made a gate .
in general , more would have been .

the natural monument looks beyond the other trees of the region and reminds us of a size of more than eight meters to an American M@@ amm@@ ut@@ baum .
a small Buddha on a tree suggests that it is a spiritual or my@@ stic place .
however , despite intensive research , there was only reference to the number of names .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider also consulted the bishop &apos;s blog and questioned older people from Unter@@ wei@@ brunn to find out what they had to do with the tum@@ bling .
the result of his investigation was the rather simplistic statement of name for the name .
thus , until some 80 years ago , the goat hunters have been driven from the most arduous of fields and fields of stones .

after weeks , Italy Premier and President-in-Office of the EU , against strong conservative resistance to the EU-Russia summit last week , won the nomination of his Secretary of State as head of the EU &apos;s foreign policy ; she will be the successor of Mr Catherine Ashton .
Ren@@ zi , like the government of the Netherlands , considers himself to be the vocation of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU .
he also expects a boost to his `` reform package &apos;&apos; in Italy .
last but not least , Ren@@ zi , too , is also hoping to lay down the left party base against him , because Mo@@ gher@@ ini is assigned to it in a more moderate way .
to the conservative representatives of the President of the Commission , Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the Council of the Council , Poland Donald Tus@@ k , who was the President of the Council , took the view in Rome to create a political balance .
at the same time , the EU &apos;s chief diplomacy will be a deputy of the President of the Commission .
the approval of the European Parliament is still considered to be safe .
otherwise , President Giorgio Napolitano would not have known the nomination of the 4@@ 1@@ year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party -LRB- PD -RRB- as a ` important recognition &apos; of Italy &apos;s role in the EU .
for almost two decades there has been optimism of the fact that the `` enormous challenges &apos;&apos; of almost two decades in leading party offices have grown .
the native Roman is married and has two daughters .
her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the former Social Democratic Party -LRB- Left Democrats -RRB- , which joined the Catholic Centre Party of Margherita to today &apos;s Social Democratic Party .
in 1999 Mo@@ gher@@ ini was appointed Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Independent Youth -LRB- European Young Soci@@ alists -RRB- .
with the election of 2001 in the party council of the Left Democrats , she went into high party politics and worked in the Foreign Affairs Department , which he became soon .
the traditional focus of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East has been known through studies of the NATO effort in Afghanistan in which Italy has been involved in a loan of troops , with contacts to the Social Democrats in Europe and to the Democrats in the United States .
since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Representatives , in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs .
when Ren@@ zi became Prime Minister in February 2014 , he directed to his Secretary of State .
if the PD once again had a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country , which participated in the more than 40 % of the party at the European elections in May , then , as has been recorded in P@@ D-@@ circles , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini has a share in this .
there is too little diplomatic experience in Brussels , which has too little diplomatic experience , which is what is happening in the PD .

the socialists in France should think `` the mouth and put France in order , &apos;&apos; said the main ally of Mr Hollande .
Mr V@@ alls called on the deeply divided left to show `` her love for the disputed socialist president , whose cabinet has been thrown up by the large majority of the French .
the President deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
`` It is our duty to stay on his side , &apos;&apos; said he .
the Prime Minister said that his government is not going to question the controversial 35-@@ hour week in France despite severe calls for a relaxation of the rules of Emmanuel Mac@@ ron , the new economic minister .
on Saturday , Mr Hollande had strongly called on his fellow Soci@@ alists to be `` united &apos;&apos; with the government .

Navy Le Pen , the far right leader of the National Front , sent out the permanent tomb of the socialists and said that they can not imagine that the new authorities would have longer months than a few months
François Hollande is the emperor without clothes , but Prince Manuel V@@ alls also did not have to form a new government if the old did not survive a summer .
`` and the new will not survive the autumn or winter , &apos;&apos; said a Le Pen with support .
she repeatedly reiterated the reputation of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident and that he was the winner of early elections as the winner .
the ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the French elections in March and the National Front stood at the European elections in May .
a survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dim@@ è revealed that 76 % of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of breaking up to several rival groups before the end of the term of the term of the term of the term of the term of the term of Belgrade .
Pascal Per@@ rin@@ eau , a politician at the University of Sciences , warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and the employment of unemployment .
`` There is a small window of possibilities , but public opinion must feel quickly that things change , &apos;&apos; he warned .
otherwise , the situation could continue to deteriorate .

pro-@@ Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision .
a p@@ ek@@ ing@@ loyal group moved to the Chinese flag close to the Chinese flag .
the permanent committee of the National People &apos;s Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday on Sunday which allows for only two or three candidates for the decision in Hong Kong in 2017 .
first of all , all candidates will have to obtain the majority support of a nomination committee , which is expected to be filled with p@@ ek@@ ing@@ loyal members .
through this decision , it is almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and lead pro-@@ democracy activists to take up their threats and make Hong Kong the financial place for Hong Kong .
political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong ; and China &apos;s party leaders fear that the calls for democracy can be extended to other cities .
following the publication of a Beijing White Paper , which was set out in June , democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region where hundreds of thousands of them invaded the city and organised a sit@@ -in .
L@@ is survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong .
the deputy chairman of the legal committee of the permanent committee , Z@@ hang R@@ ong@@ sh@@ un and the Vice-@@ Director of the offices of Hong Kong and Mac@@ aus of the State Council , should be consulted in the course of the day .
student activists announced that they had to meet on the afternoon before the office of the leadership in Hong Kong .

Putin is calling on Kiev to include `` national talks &apos;&apos; with the O@@ stu@@ kra@@ ine .
the Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government sets out the fighting against the separ@@ ati@@ sts in the east of the country and takes part in negotiations on the ` state &apos; of the break@@ away region .
his spokesman , Dimit@@ ri Pes@@ kov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that this would become part of Russia under the control of the most vulnerable area of O@@ stu@@ kra@@ ine , but to re@@ define his status towards Ukraine in order to give the Russian-@@ speaking region the power of representing its rights and interests .
however , Putin &apos;s call for negotiations on equal relations with pro-@@ Russian insurgents , however , to the strategy that he has seen from the beginning of the wars of five months , is that since the beginning of the last five months it appears to be a strategy : aid for the separ@@ ati@@ sts of areas and pressures on the Ukrainian Government to enable the newly proclaimed region of No@@ vor@@ o@@ ssi@@ ja to be
in an interview with the state television channel channel , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the withdrawal of areas held by separ@@ ati@@ sts in the eastern regions of Don@@ ez@@ k and Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k , which had been taken in March and April after Moscow extended the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March .
in recent times , the Kremlin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have described this as `` No@@ vor@@ o@@ ssi@@ ja &apos;&apos; or `` Neur@@ uss@@ land , &apos;&apos; a term that reminds us of the pre-@@ revolutionary bril@@ liance of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all of those who in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians are in favour of the elections on the 26th , while government groups of civil communities in the territories held by separ@@ ati@@ sts are trying to do `` in their illusions , &apos;&apos; I@@ tar@@ -T@@ ass reported .
`` We need to start detailed discussions , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of the Southeast Asia in order to maintain the interests of the people living in this area .
Pes@@ kov said that Putin &apos;s reference to statehood had to be seen in the context of greater autonomy , which has been discussed since months from the Kiev leadership to reassure fears in Russian-@@ speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened .
only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy , said Pes@@ kov .
it is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Pes@@ kov , because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal conflict in Ukraine . &apos;&apos;
the Kremlin &apos;s clarification of correcting the `` mis@@ interpretation &apos;&apos; of Putin &apos;s remarks highlighted Russia &apos;s leadership claim in dealing with separatist rebellion in the East in contrast to the direct passage of the Crimea , where the majority of the two million inhabitants are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in connecting the regions of Don@@ ez@@ k and Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k to O@@ stu@@ kra@@ ine , because most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict resulted in a broad majority for staying in Ukraine .
the autonomy mentioned by Russian diplomats on international forums would be the responsibility of regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations , and to give the Kremlin de facto control of an area that links the Russian territory to the Crimea .
the peninsula in the Black Sea is located five months ago in the Black Sea , with the majority of the Russian Navy and an important trade port and historical coastal region .
the regions between the countries of Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines , factories and found@@ ries that produce important components for the Russian military .
in his speech on the declaration of office on 7 June , the Ukrainian President , Pet@@ ro Por@@ o@@ stan , proposed that Ukrainian legislation - to new elections - should consider amendments to the Constitution which give the respective areas greater control over their finances and the status of languages .
but his vision of autonomy appears to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels .
Putin &apos;s last invitation to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders was followed by a further pre@@ occupation of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks over the previously peaceful region along the A@@ Soviet Sea have been merged into the Baltic Sea .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts supported by Russia , according to fears of Ukrainian security officers , took the first step of a campaign for the takeover of the strategic coastal region to the Crimea , the control of No@@ wo@@ as@@ ow@@ sk .
this is why massive civil and military preparations have begun to support Mari@@ u@@ pol , a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants , which is between No@@ wo@@ as@@ ow@@ sk and the narrow access to the Crimea peninsula .
on Saturday , at a meeting of EU leadership in Brussels , Por@@ o@@ val asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet Republic that has been independent for 23 years .
`` We are briefly in front of a point where there is no longer .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located on the territory of Ukraine .
the EU summit did not adopt any concrete actions that demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia , which is supposed to enter into force .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in I@@ lo@@ wa@@ j@@ sk after two Russian tanks of tanks and 1,000 soldiers met last week in the Olympic region to support the besieg@@ ed separ@@ ati@@ sts , Colonel Andri@@ j Ly@@ sen@@ ko , spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council , said on Saturday in Kiev .
the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers who have been included in I@@ lo@@ wa@@ j@@ sk by the Russian Senate were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian case hunters who had been caught in Ukrainian territory a week ago .
neck around Australian Pro@@ mis and Gab@@ i Gre@@ ck@@ o
Ge@@ off@@ rey Edel@@ sten did not make his trouble about hackers , who have probably been enemies of his er@@ lob@@ ten Gab@@ i Gre@@ ck@@ o , who have stolen the A Pro@@ mis from Hollywood .
the film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a h@@ acker scandal around Pro@@ mis on the Internet .
the hackers responsible for doing so probably have more than 60 characters from Lawrence , Star of the tri@@ mmer of pan@@ em and super@@ stars , including the models of Kate U@@ pt@@ on and Car@@ a Del@@ ev@@ ing@@ ne , the sons of R@@ ih@@ anna , Ari@@ ana Grande and Le@@ a Michelle and the actress Kir@@ sten Dun@@ st .
of the Australian actors of the art of the island of Pal@@ mer , Emil@@ y Bro@@ wning , Yvonne Stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and Gre@@ ck@@ o have been published in Melbourne . they also became private photos because of an expression of their own .
on the list are 101 Pro@@ mis .
the finest that had escaped with Gre@@ ck@@ o last month said `` It is contradictory . &apos;&apos;
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a shame that private information can be stolen and forwarded to others .
Gre@@ ck@@ o , at the time in New York , said , according to reports from a news website that was `` shameful &apos;&apos; .
the h@@ acker probably has 30 pictures of Pal@@ mer with her ex-@@ friend Scott Speed@@ man , two of them in which they are at the top of the pool .
the film works of Pal@@ mers belong to `` Love is un@@ defeated bar &apos;&apos; with Li@@ am Hem@@ s@@ worth .
Pal@@ mer , Chu@@ ck-@@ Star Stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and the actress Bro@@ wning from Su@@ cker P@@ unch were not available yesterday for comments on the covered images .
a representative of Lawrence said to TM@@ Z : `` It is a despicable violation of privacy . &apos;&apos;

Rad@@ ler , Jog@@ ger and hikers took part at the 8th wheel on the Great Feld@@ berg yesterday and thus supported the association of `` help for children &apos;s children . &apos;&apos;
the tour that was for the one was for the other a slight training .
however , in one of them all of us agreed that there has been a lot of fun .
Thomas Stu@@ dan@@ ski should have been sleeping well at last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the Ober@@ ur@@ sel@@ er brewery took place with the wheel on the Feld@@ berg .
for the good purpose .
he is very easy to find , given that he has also made a valuable impression of the participation in the 8th cycle of cycling on the Great Land@@ berg in favor of the association of children of cancer -LRB- Frankfurt -RRB- .
this is a great thing .
`` I now know that I can do it ! &apos;&apos;
do you have any questions about this ?

like Thomas Stu@@ dan@@ ski , who has been sitting for the CDU in the middle of the city , many of the 7@@ 18 participants died at the spring to the mountains yesterday and came close to exhaustion , but happy on the plateau .
