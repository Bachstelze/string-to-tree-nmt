returning to the very American ideal of the working rights as human rights
the Congress for Congress and John Lewis have put forward a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights .
`` As trade unions die , too will die the middle class jobs , &apos;&apos; said Ell@@ ison , a democrat of the Progressive C@@ auc@@ us in Congress .
that is why I am proud to be proud of the Staff Regulations Act .
this pioneering law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions such as other forms of discrimination - to stop anti-@@ union forces .
the addition of the national legal law to create an opportunity for discrimination against workers in the organisation of a trade union in order to complain about justice before a civil court and to obtain compensation or penalties .
but there is certainly no radical initiative , certainly not to American standards .
indeed , the best way is to understand what Ell@@ ison , Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal suggest , to a very American idea .
in spite of the setbacks that have been exposed to the trade unions over the past few years , Americans have once again encouraged Americans to recognise , extend and comply with working rights .
there was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy , free speech , freedom of the press and the right of association .
when the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his family encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militar@@ ised auto@@ cracy was replaced by democracy .
in full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions have a role in the creation of a new Japan , they used a language that explicitly recognised that the rights of workers are guaranteed on association and on joint negotiation and action .
when the United States meets Germany after the Second World War , General D@@ wi@@ ght David Eisen@@ ho@@ wer and his team are the Germans to write a constitution that would make sure that fascism replaced Adolf Hitler by a strong democracy .
in recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organise , and their voice to be raised in the new nation , the Germans added a clause that explicitly said : `` The right to establish associations to safeguard and improve the work and economic conditions .
agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it are zero and void ; this is illegal .
when the former First Lady was chaired by the International Commission on Human Rights , the General Declaration of Human Rights was drafted by the United Nations by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement , Roosevelt and the other author , to guarantee that any of them has the right to defend their interests or to join them . &apos;&apos;
for generations , Americans have been able to accept the fundamental rights of human rights .
as this country , Americans told us how to shape civilian and democratic societies , that the right to establish a union - that this trade union should be protected as an equivalent partner with companies and government authorities .
indeed , following these rights in America , it is indeed very wise to give the American ideal to the fore , which is why the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free , open society .
as Martin Luther King Wilson said fifty years ago , that was said :
history is a great teacher .
now all of us know that the labor movement does not reduce the nation &apos;s strength , but enlarged them .
by increasing the living standards of millions of people , work has created a market for industry and has raised the whole nation on an unprecedented level of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but history keeps them .
history reminds , and that is what we should do .
the formal recognition of the rights of human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights , as the protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
Kevin Ell@@ ison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and got the promise of democracy .
judge stops on a temporary law that all forms of abortion are forced to be closed .
on Sunday , a U.S. Federation stopped the implementation of a law in California , by the lawyers , that it would probably have ended up to all of us .
this measure , raised by Felix Jin@@ dal , Governor of California , in June , and on 1 September , would force doctors who are carrying out abortion to acquire a patient service at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice .
however , the decision of the judge means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortion for the time being .
`` The plain@@ tiff can continue to carry out law , while they try to obtain these rights , &apos;&apos; wrote Federal judge John de@@ vol@@ elles in his judgment .
within one month , a hearing is scheduled for the judge to make a more lasting decision for the law .
the decision was welcomed by the youngest in a series of judgments against similar measures .
`` The decision taken today means that women are going to miss the wrong law that wants to take their health and rights , &apos;&apos; said Nancy Nor@@ up , President and Chairman of the Centre for Re@@ production rights , in the name of three of the five hospitals in the State , to stop the law .
it was not just clear whether the verdict was also extended to the doctors from the two clinics , which the complaint did not apply .
it is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws .
key to a law in Texas , which was the majority of the hospitals remaining in the state was stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
the American College of O@@ stell@@ tri@@ cians and Gy@@ nec@@ thos as well as the American Medical Association have agreed to demand unnecessary restrictions on the rights of doctors .
contrary to what is said , the measures are aimed at protecting the health of women , although some have also welcomed the effects of the closure of hospitals .
only a doctor who is carrying out abortion has the center of reproductive rights .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to carry out abortion , this doctor would no longer carry out the surgery .
in their argument against the judgment , the representatives of the State said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortion .
delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates by egg cancer in rural areas .
Angel@@ ina Jo@@ lie and her brother James have sent a video for their mother online .
for women in the rural areas of Australia , there is a higher risk of dying of egg cancer than for women in cities .
researchers analysed the medical data from more than 1100 Australian companies , and found that only 25 % of them were still in life after the diagnosis .
the research of the researchers of the Q@@ IM@@ R Bergh@@ ofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , the risk of mortality during the study was 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
small STU@@ DER : new medicinal products could slow down lung and egg cancer .
researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of woman influenced the chances of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer was further advanced for the diagnosis , survival rate was lowest .
for those who lived in rural and remote regions , the mortality risk was 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
although the study did not investigate why women living outside the town died of the more likely loss of egg cancer , Dr. Jordan claims that a delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centers are possible factors for this .
`` This disease is treated in the best of gyn@@ a@@ ological On@@ k@@ ologists , and these are usually found in major cities , &apos;&apos; `` she said .
in spite of improving telem@@ atics services to counter the distances , they proposed a strengthening of the service of frozen doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women with their place of residence .
Dr. Jordan said that the study , irrespective of geographical status , showed a bad life rate for women in egg cancer and stressed the need for better treatment .
the study carried out by Rio T@@ into will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
in March 2013 , El@@ ther Ne@@ ave , a young mother of 33 years , learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of egg cancer .
garden centers to regret a lack of domestic ownership
the decline , together with a reinforced Sin@@ ken of the number of people under 35 years , could lead to the loss of 10 thousand pounds per year if the young consumers today are reporting after a study of HT@@ A , as reported in the Financial Times .
the report states that passengers spend an average of 55 percent of the amount to spend people in their garden .
the growth of people who live in highly urban areas without gardens are the popular process of constructing parks for parking purposes and threatening the garden size , threatening the industry , which is estimated to be estimated $ 5 billion in sales .
in the area of London , in the case of a period of 6 years , the minimum expenditure on garden products per household will be reported .
the HT@@ A and the Royal Hor@@ wark Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can not plants
Guy Bar@@ ter , chief chef for the R@@ HS , said : `` container fermentation is very popular for rent , for example , because they can take their plants in a move .
the HT@@ A report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the `` golden age &apos;&apos; of the garden because of rising domestic property and economic prosperity from the late 1980 &apos;&apos; s until the middle of the 1990s .
he also predicted a better market situation for the better flying weather in March and April last year .
the protest movement in Pakistan goes further to the protest movement in Pakistan .
in the capital of Islamabad , about 1000 demonstrators have raised the State Television P@@ TV .
information minister Per@@ v@@ ai@@ z Ras@@ kel said that soldiers could have been able to push out of P@@ TV buildings .
the transmitter sent its operation for about 40 minutes .
at the same time , about 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Na@@ wa@@ z Shar@@ if .
around a kilometre away from that , they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped with security forces .
the police led T@@ ren@@ eng@@ as .
the demonstrators demanded Sh@@ ari@@ fs resignation , but that is rejected .
the army of the country meanwhile calls for a political solution to the conflict , without wasting time and without applying violence .
after a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening , the military told the army to guarantee the security of the state .
the military plays an important role in Pakistan .
the opposition politician Im@@ ran Khan raises Prime Minister Shar@@ if when the parliamentary election in May last year .
the protests took place in the weekend after Khan and his followers had called upon their followers to resign to Sh@@ ari@@ fs Residence .
three people were killed .
Turkey ordered U.S. diplomat on the basis of espionage .
the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed the oldest US diplomats in the country to enter into a report on American and British espionage in Turkey .
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs said that the business officers of the US and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday .
the German magazine The mirror as well as the online magazine The Inter@@ c@@ Concept , show that Turkey was a major practice area for the US and British intelligence services .
according to Turkish news agencies , the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yip Erdogan found the importance of the report and said that all the important countries have become members of each other .
a previous report , which was also targeted at the most important intelligence service in Germany Ankara , caused a much more dis@@ respectful response from the Turkish Government .
warning : the guides are threatening to compete with the consequences for comm@@ ors .

we expect a lot of delays .
regional priorities do not exist .
the main sequence of warning is the movement of goods .
Deutsche Bahn announced that everything should be done to keep the effects as low as possible .
however , the G@@ DL did not say where she likes to strike , that it is difficult to predict the consequences .
die Poli@@ elect of Mag@@ ok@@ f of corruption
on Friday , on Friday the office of the Public Prosecutor provided evidence for blackmail by police officers and employees of the town of Cal@@ vi@@ à .
the chef of the police of Cal@@ vi@@ à on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested after corruption allegations by businessmen and bar@@ owners in the notorious Bin@@ ge-@@ free estate Mag@@ gor@@ f .
the main Commissioner of José Antonio was taken against him by several businessmen from Punta Ball@@ ena , the street in which the majority of bars and nightclubs are by Mag@@ gor@@ f .
following the information of the online newspaper Mallorca Di@@ ario , the Ministry of Justice presented the Office of the Public Prosecutor for the fight against corruption on Friday evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of Cal@@ vi@@ à .
two others have been arrested by the Spanish Civil Civil in relation to corruption and are consulted jointly by a judge .
the national Spanish daily newspaper ABC reported that the angry night dog owners said that the authorities have a serious impact on their business .
`` It is no longer money to earn , &apos;&apos; said one of the businessmen in the court .
let our livelihoods come from the game .
we have nothing to lose .
in this summer , Mag@@ acro@@ f took up international headlines on the basis of a six-@@ year-old British tourist that took place in 24 men .
since then , the island authorities have tried to stop the unlawful behaviour of non-@@ alcoholic tourists in Mag@@ gor@@ f , by minimizing the number of participants to the notorious non-@@ alcoholic beverages .
the Play@@ house Club , in which the coat took place , was forced for a year of closure , while Play@@ house and the pub Car@@ n@@ age have to pay a penalty of 5@@ 5,000 € -LRB- 7@@ 3,000 -RRB- .
the tourist town Mag@@ gor@@ f , who is popular with young British tourists , is also known for several accidents in alcohol , including the `` Bal@@ con@@ ing , &apos;&apos; in which people jump from one balcony to the other or from a balcony in the hotel pool .
the first time of early life with wet weather conditions is caused by flights from the airport .
the spring has brought South Africa a winter surprise , with strong show@@ ers and strong wind , that caused flights from the airport .
in the evening until 21 p.m. there fell to the city after 6.@@ 6@@ mm , which was already in the night for Sunday .
the final result was the result of a series of short and long runs , including a g@@ opping , which started shortly before 20 am , for almost 4@@ mm in about 10 minutes .
after the winter of last week , the temperatures in the city on Monday fell to a maximum of only 15.@@ 8 ° C
the bad weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight of Virgin Airlines of Melbourne .
the plane had to land shortly after 7.30 p.m. , but was hit by a hammer wind - a sudden change in the wind speed or a short distance from the road .
the wind reached about 50 km @/@ h on the ground on the airport .
the flight data showed that the plane had to start on a second landing flight and finally set up about 20.@@ 40 .
the flight delay resulted in the delay of some of the other flights , including one from Dubai and a qu@@ ant@@ as flight from Sydney .
for Liverpool , a maximum temperature temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday .
Matthew is one of the most important in the world .
in the face of the fascinating technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech switches , Bernd Matthew is with a very familiar electronic accessory .
while I write this here , I look at the spiral cable , which connects the phone to the phone , and I think : Bo@@ ah , which is what is happening ?
but behind that : if the cable would not be , would be able to fly in the house in a very short time .
anyway , anyway , on the ek@@ el@@ tron@@ ic ?
no , typo@@ graphical errors : electronic -RRB- the rule that the world premiere of today is the electric waste of tomorrow - outdated .
and those of us today have a silver TV in the living room that says that he is rejecting television in principle .
why ?
because we are pushing the I@@ fa on the radio tower in this week , our absolute incompetence leads to questions about electronics .
the La@@ ie , who was blind to the washing machine and CD player , does not even understand the purpose of the equipment that will spread to him : `` Connec@@ ted Home , W@@ ear@@ ables , Health Care and Urban Technologies promise us the press office .
yes , what &apos;s going on ?
what are we going to talk about people who seem to spread voluntarily ?
in fact , for about 20 years , we have been in favour of linking our house .
that is why the yo@@ ghurt takes care to tell us that it is burning out in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful when we come from the office out of the air condition on our immediate arrival ?
yes , that requires air conditioning .
but a dream will definitely be true : we put our hands in our hands , say `` Sau@@ gen ! &apos;&apos;
it is misleading .
everything is going to be less than a revolution : `` The boundaries between white and brown goods will combine the washing machine , you can combine the washing machine with a headphones , the steam bath will show the weather report and the data bri@@ lle shows how long the pizza is needed in the oven , but what does nothing make sure because we stand in st@@ au .
from daily practice we know that if a newer device is really needed , the battery is empty .
another reason for this is that the spiral cable will survive on the phone .
Israeli children are returning to their schools after the war in Gaza .
thousands of Israeli children from the areas near Gaza returned to schools on Monday , when they had spent the summer in air defence , while during the 50-@@ day war between Israel and Hamas , the schools stayed in Gaza .
the school start was a feeling of joy and expectation , but the signs of the fighting are still fresh .
in the southern town of Ash@@ do@@ d , employees of the `` Pas@@ ho@@ sh &apos;&apos; children garden , which was hit by a rocket , went to the walls and boots in the old town of Ash@@ do@@ d .
`` We have a bit of fear , but they are excited , &apos;&apos; said that Ron@@ it don@@ s .
many children from our area urgently need the return to a routine .
her 11-@@ year-old daughter Sh@@ ani of Sh@@ ani said that she feels `` a bit of fun &apos;&apos; to go once again into school .
`` It was difficult times , and we did not go out of the house , &apos;&apos; she said .
President Rev@@ ven Sin@@ lin visited Ki@@ gi near the border with Gaza to offer its support .
until a ceasefire last week , thousands of residents of the border communities stayed in their homes , or left their homes to escape from Gaza in safer areas .
many residents of the Middle East , a municipality near the border with Gaza , are still returning to the return .
the Ministry of Education told us that about a dozen families have not yet returned .
their children have been housed in other schools for the time being .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in S@@ der@@ ot , a border town on Gaza .
he appealed to the children to learn a lot and said that we will make sure that your knowledge can be acquired .
Israel and Hamas agreed on a permanent ceasefire last Tuesday .
the ceasefire provided for an immediate end to the fighting , but important problems remain unresolved , as Hamas &apos;s demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Palestinian blockade in Gaza is in Gaza .
Israel is asking for the disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two to the fighting .
a new round of indirect discussions is expected to begin in Egypt this month .
in the war , more than 2,@@ 100 Palestinians were killed , three quarters of civilians , and at least 4@@ 94 children after estimates of the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel denies these claims and estimates that it is at least half of the movement but does not have any concrete evidence of this information .
on the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza broke 4.@@ 5@@ 91 rockets and brain gran@@ ents during the fighting in Israeli cities , which are most in the south of the country .
in the meantime , the Israeli military led to more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
the Israeli attacks were damaged or destroyed by thousands of homes in the Gaza region , with about 100 UN schools .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective rooms , the education authorities postponed last week at the beginning of the school year .
`` I hope the school will soon be opened so that we can learn further , just like the children in the world and the Jewish children , &apos;&apos; said Mohammad Am@@ ara , a 13-@@ year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City .
after election in Saxony : CD@@ U-@@ Vi@@ ze Stro@@ bl is questioning N@@ P@@ D
in the face of the death loss of the N@@ PD in Saxony , CD@@ sub@@ sole has expressed itself as the end of the current N@@ P@@ D ban before the Federal Constitutional Court .
Berlin - L@@ aut CD sub@@ sole by Thomas Stro@@ bl will find the current prohibition procedure against the N@@ PD before the Federal Constitutional Court .
`` The N@@ PD is worse off than in the last time , &apos;&apos; said Stro@@ bl , who is also CD@@ U@@ land in Baden-Württemberg .
this is a good development in the right direction and development that leads me to the result to fight the N@@ PD politically and not before the Constitutional Court .
in the vote on Sunday , the N@@ PD failed to fail .
a first attempt for a ban on the right was failed in 2003 .
in December 2013 , the Federal Council received a new request in Karlsruhe .
the Federal Government and the Bundestag did not .
Har@@ burg : tents for new refugees
refugees are now housed in tents now .
the headquarters of the headquarters for refugees in Har@@ burg turned out of all the seams .
now , the internal authority has put in place three tents from the Red Cross .
the members of the Chamber have just been informed - they are hardly enthusiastic .
`` There are no opportunities for the citizens and do they not have any opportunity to participate constructively in the humane housing of refugees , &apos;&apos; says the President of the Group of the Greens , in the Har@@ burger District Meeting .
their party claims that the district administration of Har@@ burg is available for accommodation at the moment .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
the reason for filling up in the first photograph is the An@@ ran of Help - and the fact that the authorities are unable to provide enough places in the future .
many refugees remain longer than the normal three months .
the skin prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years .
the R@@ P-@@ data from Monday in August rose to 1.1 percent in August .
by this increase lies the total increase in June , July and August at 4.2 percent , the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase was 10.@@ 9 % , more like the increase in the 12 months until August 2013 , but the increases were not distributed evenly over the country .
the research director of WM@@ Data , Tim Law@@ less , announced that Sydney and Melbourne have a two-@@ divided market .
the figures of WM@@ Data show that the skin prices in Sydney rose by 16.@@ 1 % last year , against 11.@@ 7 percent .
the following markets are Liverpool , Brisbane and Darwin , in which prices rose by five and six percent .
at the other end of the scale , the scale of the spectrum lies in the volume of government spending .
Mr Law@@ less further said that , in the early seasons , the next few months would be a rise in the properties that the market would have on the market .
`` When you look at the constantly high rate of auction prices , a generally fast sales rate , and the constantly low interest environment , it is probably that the home journey will continue to rise in the next three months , &apos;&apos; said he .
in an opinion on the New Press , he is contrary to the statements by the business leader of peer Med@@ au .
the style of the university is not .
that is why the Med@@ au family was informed about the university in mid-@@ June .
the statement that the plans were only known in July are definitely wrong .
at the same time , it refers to the fact that the plans are not `` pre-@@ found &apos;&apos; and decisions , but would be `` preferences . &apos;&apos;
the expansion of the narrow road to the castle is also less dramatic than from the Med@@ aus .
from about nine meters wide road was and is not the speech .
it goes to 5.@@ 50 meters , that is a meter wider than before .
the argument of the Med@@ au operators is that they will only be used by students of the university .
because this can be solved intelligently , it is now intelligently solved by other public parking spaces .
thinking about residents
there is a lot of people who want to stay in the area .
in fact , it is important to bear in mind , that it is not just about the children , but also about the people of the people .
it is therefore a lot of things that are far greater than in the interests of the gentlemen of Med@@ au .
whether the criticism of the child was criticised , with the expansion of the road , one of the few natural spots of Cob@@ ur@@ gs would be `` the reader can decide . &apos;&apos;
at the beginning of October , P@@ rum@@ l wants to inform the city about the development of the university by 2020 .
peer Med@@ au last week informed the parents of the children about the plans of the university .
therefore , the access to the new parking deck is not going to lead to the campus and then to the Med@@ au Berg .
in this way , the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometre .
according to the high accounts of the Med@@ aus , the traffic in the park of Burgundy would make ten times .
there are about 2,000 vehicles per day .
in the past , we did not want to comment on the project .

the 60th anniversary of the Federal Ministry of Commerce led to health problems for this decision .
the decision is not easy to say , she is living over several months .
it &apos;s for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team .
it is therefore taking stock of 167 country games and 5@@ 76 gates for Germany in international retirement .
because of the fact that there is still a lot of people , he will no longer be able to go to the new federal trainer Dag@@ ur Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ sson .
with the Is@@ lands who announced on Tuesday his K@@ ader for the country games against Switzerland , G@@ land@@ orf introduced a long and good conversation .

the latter has also brought the living to the as@@ ke@@ tic monk , who , as he says , `` by making everything . &apos;&apos;

lenny Henry : my father has never taken me in the arm .
has never said `` I love you
Henry was one of seven children in Du@@ d@@ ley in Du@@ d@@ ley in 1958 .
his father , as Henry 19 was , worked in a factory and its relationship .
Henry tested for a comedy , Ru@@ dy &apos;s R@@ are Records , which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father , from the series on Radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mixture of reg@@ ent and r@@ ap , with lively melodies .
but Henry had to work with a number of difficult children .
he visited `` many &apos;&apos; therapies after the death of his mother , and Henry is beyond his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
there was never his face , but just heard his voice :
let your sister be quiet .
think about you !
I would like to look at bands .
my older brothers Se@@ ym@@ our and Hilton - which have already grown - went to him in the pub and talked about things such as the form of beer .
I have never had such a conversation with him .
much of my life he was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper .
recently , Henry opened a consortium in Du@@ d@@ ley , while the conditions are better than during his father but have a look at how to have been the life of him .
it is now a bit lighter , but she is dark , tired , deep .
my father was once in the bath and then he was able to listen to him how to sing because he was able to wash .
when I went around , it was clear to me that he had done this for years to give the food to the table .
nevertheless , Henry grew up as a child without love of his parents .
my father never said that he never said `` I love you . &apos;&apos;
only when my mother went badly against the end of her life , we began , `` I love you , I love you , I love to say .
through his own daughter Bil@@ lie , he was able to share the love he was missing as a child .
let &apos;s stop you with the `` I love you &apos;&apos; ?
Oh , I would like to get rid of ourselves !
hello , I &apos;m 22 !
with Dawn French .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still in French that he was married for 25 years .
dawn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
she was a mother of her own mother .
that contributed to her death .
so when I was very keen to show symptoms of diabetes , my physician needs to be radical .
so I moved to this fitness and had to make a dramatic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is hard .
no one likes to eat .
Hen@@ ry &apos;s career change can be found in its elegant , short cut bar .
since he was praised by the critics , he was united by the theatre .
it followed the comedy of the mis@@ ings , and then F@@ alls of August Wilson .
this is a different experience than the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ partments that have filled his busy working life .
he started with just 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a DJ discovered him on the stage and wrote about him .
his television began in the middle of the 1970s . `` I was for a very long time of the only Black I@@ mit@@ ator / Com@@ coon on television . &apos;&apos;
he learned in the profession .
I had to learn not only about the public but also from 1975 to 1985 , and I was able to become an efficient W@@ itz@@ e-@@ narrative machine , while the television was a star , and that was really difficult .
lenny 1975 in New Fac@@ es
since his manager had the stage law on the Black and White Min@@ str@@ el Show , a light entertainment program in which the people `` black an@@ m@@ old &apos;&apos; led Henry his comedy there for five years .
my family was very unpleasant .
I would somehow hope that it would never happen , but I regret that I have done it .
it was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a great audience .
but this `` years of award-winning light pillar of British television &apos;&apos; was also a `` grotesque par@@ ch of black people . &apos;&apos;
by the introduction of the figures that the British black culture has celebrated , Henry worked in the 1980s on an alternative Com@@ ed@@ y@@ circle .
the first series of lenny Henry Show was published in 1984 .
advertising , documentary films , TV series , and film rolls took place in the next decade , but after its BB@@ C series Lenn@@ y@@ Hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv 2008 he thought : `` what do you want to do ? &apos;&apos; because it feels as if you only feel the time .
then a documentary series for Radio 4 came to the title .
the first consequence was about Shakespeare .
on Shakespeare I was actually allergic .
I had never learned him about him in school and was mostly in favour of a domain of the middle class .
that is why I feared great fear .
all that we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Tre@@ vor Yang n , Adrian Les@@ ter , Ju@@ di Den@@ ch said you should try it .
do not go bad if you do n&apos;t know what you are doing .
take a couple of words in the mouth and then understand why we love all Shakespeare .
Henry led 20 lines from O@@ thel@@ los last speech for the documentary and was enthusiastic .
I had the feeling that I could do that .
it was almost as if someone had finally put the head in the right direction .
`` That is what it is , it is a serious matter , you are serious about your text , you will learn a bit .
the samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we made it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and that did not happen .
and soon he went to the comedy .
suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe .
there was a moment when I thought , `` Oh , you have changed you .
there was a technical error and Henry felt that he had to listen to the audience .
`` A small voice told me `` You have to bridge 10 minutes , while they repair the computer .
instead , the stage leader announced that the idea would go as soon as the problem was solved .
I went out of the stage and something in me said `` Oh , God is to me .
I am not responsible for that .
I can leave that to someone else .
`` You play in a play play , therefore stay in your role .
Henry in F@@ alls on Du@@ sh Theatre
the text was learned to learn .
panic is very good , and that strengthens the view .
that too was good , and it is like a great sign of the gods that tell me .
he says this , of course , with a Thursday vote .
that is what I would like to do .
I love that .
I love to be in a sample room .
Henry has always had the head of a com@@ coon - our conversation is broken away by a lot of emotion .
I decided not to make a stand-alone comedy , because I think that this type of immediate satisfaction is dangerous to a room of any kind .
if you look for it you will go to a wall .
I &apos;m sometimes working live in Apollo , but on the whole there are not as much as before .
I wonder whether he will once again make a stand-alone Com@@ ed@@ y@@ tour .
the fun I have in one room with a director who helps to make a start , and the end of a journey - I do not believe I want to give up .
is that the new In@@ kar@@ nation ?
I think it is .
I &apos;m happy to be an actor .
it is fun .
there is always a story , and that is great .
I love stories .
people love stories .

Kenya registered officials to `` ghost workers
Kenya has started to register all state officials , in order to delete ` ghost workers &apos; from the government &apos;s salary lists .
employees who would not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay , was a government communication .
the government claims that thousands of people are still receiving salaries from the public service .
President U@@ hur@@ u Kenya promised to combat corruption in the public service .
in a test at the beginning of this year , at least 1 million per month was lost in payments for `` ghost workers &apos;&apos; .
the government claims that salaries continue to be paid to accounts after a person died or leaves the public service
all officials will now appear in the next two weeks at identification centers to make sure that their data are included through biometric registrations .
all who did not go out of the salary list went on to go on .
`` This approach will contribute substantially to ration@@ alising the public service , by identifying the actual number of officials , by eliminating the salary list on both government levels - that is what the `` ghost workers &apos;&apos; are being eliminated , &apos;&apos; said Anne Wa@@ ig@@ uru , the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of decentralisation and Planning .

children need roots and wings
he was in school service in 44 years , including 23 as a school director .
from this time , Manfred Richter is aware of many det@@ and@@ ous Peter@@ sh@@ aus@@ ener and collision from their time as a student .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but always due to his desire to see people .
the snow tea is the most popular mountain in the Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland .
judges was born in 1930 in Trau@@ ten@@ au @/@ northern Bohemia , today Tr@@ ut@@ nov .
already with 14 he met for the teacher profession after four years .
a year after that , the Su@@ gha German was lifted .
within half a hour , the family had to leave their house .
after a few months in a camp , it went to Bavaria in 1946 .
that &apos;s why it was going to go to justice in the middle of the valley .
the teacher formation took place in Heidelberg .
for this reason , Manfred Richter had to take ten kilometres to the next train station for ten kilometres , and on the evening back to the centre to go for three kilometres across the entire city .
after two months , Manfred Richter received a sleeping room in a Red Cross Home in Germany : together with up to 15 mit@@ es in a sleeping room .
in 1951 he made the first in 1954 after three years of teaching .
since Ober@@ fran@@ ken had no free lessons for him , he went to Ober@@ bay@@ ern and came to the school on 1 November 1954 .
the `` milling room &apos;&apos; was its first `` service apartment &apos;&apos; in the school house .
in 1958 he referred to a three-@@ room service apartment in the newly-@@ built teacher house .
this house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 , after the school was dissolved in Karlsruhe in 1968 .
until then , there have been three classes in the school association of Peter@@ sh@@ aus@@ en-@@ Bei@@ bach .
from the school year in 1968 @/@ 69 , these were brought together in Peter@@ shausen in today &apos;s town hall .
when the school association In@@ der@@ sdorf was founded , only the primary class remained in the place .
in order to avoid a return in the smaller school , the then release of Georg Sig@@ l changed to Karlsruhe - and Manfred Richter .
but Peter@@ shausen grew up , and from September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to build today &apos;s construction , in 1997 .
Manfred Richter is the most comfortable of the former Ministry of Culture , with the exception of a workshop room and the expansion of 1997 .
`` The mayor of Gö@@ tz was very busy , &apos;&apos; judge reminded .
in his whole career , Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative , who responded to a meeting of a school council on law and justice .
`` You have to give the children two things : roots and wings , &apos;&apos; says today 8@@ 4-@@ year-old .
and he had to learn : `` That does not succeed &apos;&apos; .
in any case , judge was sometimes illegal .
when students looked after themselves , they did not work on him and did not sit for them .
at the expense of the municipality , judges had to create two pairs of box@@ ed shoes and took them against each other .
for the benefit of the school , judges took a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Gö@@ tz -LRB- CSU -RRB- .
in 1996 , she was able to meet the party , at least as a last on the CSS list for the local authorities .
but judges was elected on the ground and went to the CSU .

if Rad@@ ler is on her tour in Bad Salz@@ hausen , this is nothing special .

meanwhile , the mayor and the crew had to work .
she was also interested in working on the site .
it was also the first time that he was able to give him the opportunity to meet .
`` the majority of participants came from the Rhine-@@ Main region , &apos;&apos; said he .
the number of participants is a bit about the accommodation capacity that is available to you .
in category I , participants will be accommodated in hotels , in category II in collections .
from the spa , the Rad@@ ler had a good impression when she broke out for about one and a half hours : `` Ch@@ ü@@ ss !
`` It was beautiful in Bad Salz@@ hausen !
after the arrival in Sch@@ ots , the group was able to take a brief break .
but in the evening the wheels were requested in the idyllic Alt@@ eb@@ urg@@ park .

dozens of Turkish police officers for the government against the government
a total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as a result of the suspicion of the `` conspiracy against the government . &apos;&apos;
the police authorities did not have a direct comment .
under the arrests there are 14 senior police officers , filed in English .
some of them have been involved in corruption against government officials , including four government ministers in December last December .
in July , a number of Turkish police officers were arrested .
the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yip Erdogan -LRB- who was Prime Minister -RRB- described her as part of the activities that are attributed to him and others in power positions .

with R@@ ona Fair@@ head , the BBC was perhaps the great director she needs .
she meets with a proud rest from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of the Tor Party .
and she has its own front experience .
her career began in the worldwide management advisory company , B@@ ain and Co . .
she was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and went back to a younger male colleagues as the top post of the mother company Pear@@ sons .
their withdrawal supposedly amounted to almost 1 million .
their political ranking is also solid .
she was recommended by David Cameron of Lord , the former Chairman of BP when she was looking for more private knowledge in Gujarat .
your husband is a former T@@ ory Council member .
already in May I described the task of the Chairman with a poisoned Kel@@ ch .
not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
the confidence is in two directions : on the inside , the first guard has become a voice of public concern and anxiety when things are going to be wrong .
this ensures an almost unsustainable du@@ o@@ pol that calls for a full comprehensive reform .
but what sort of new leader it would risk , go to everything and spread an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while it may be his job .
it is a difficult task .
and as if it were enough , many are interested to see the BBC - power , money , and status .
while competition is closer to the future , new technologies are threatening to threaten the BBC with a special risk to the BBC .
for the modest sum of 14@@ 5.@@ 50 per year , the British public will buy the world in the world .
the BBC tells a good story : she says that it reaches 96 % of all budgets and costs only 40 p@@ ence per day .
and apparently , the BBC is increasing its popularity at the top of the past : 53 percent supporting them today , compared to 31 % 10 years ago .
the visual and user habits for the BBC have changed : I get news on my cell phone today and see the desired programs later on on my i@@ Player .
but it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution .
she needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she has found it .
Perry from Texas says that they did not authorize T@@ we@@ et
a T@@ we@@ et of the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas , Rick Perry , on Sunday there was a decrease in the democratic community lawyer , which is at the heart of a criminal charge against him .
the T@@ we@@ et was later replaced by a different form of Perl .
just a T@@ we@@ et was sent by my account , which was not authorized by me .
`` I did not miss the T@@ we@@ et and he did n&apos;t delete him , &apos;&apos; he said in the later message .
the employees of Perry did not reply immediately to comments .
while the T@@ we@@ ets went to the wrong user account , it was not clear who actually served the feed .
in the former T@@ we@@ et there was an un@@ favorable picture of the Minister of Association by Tra@@ vis County , Ro@@ sem@@ ary L@@ auth@@ berg , who was sentenced to the tax in April 2013 .
Perry was acting as a veto against financial support for their offices when she refused to resign what could be a charge against Perry .
the text of the t@@ we@@ ets is : `` I do not go forever with the three-@@ fold alcohol mirror , but if I do it , I hate Governor Perry when he gets rid of it . &apos;&apos;

L@@ auth@@ berg Office was not in charge of studying the Grand jury against Perry .
this was led by Michael Mc@@ Cru@@ m , a special prosecutor from San Antonio , who was chosen by a Republican judge .
Perry does not commit himself and called the charge a political trick .
his highly technical team of lawyers asked in the case of the case the judges who refused and argued that the law was held in the hands of the oldest governor in the history of the State of Texas .
Perry abolished 7.5 million dollars of government money to the Public Integration Unit of the State - determined in Tra@@ vis County and , in cases of state corruption in Texas , refused to resign .
this veto resulted in a public complaint on the basis of a left-wing watch group .
Per@@ pology official user account is often updated - and sometimes known .
after he had completed as a five during the election meetings during his presidential campaign in 2012 , Perry went to speculation that he was going to stop by going to a T@@ we@@ et of a photos of himself in the silence near a lake , with the words `` South Carolina , !
Berkeley explains housing market again for `` normal &apos;&apos;
one of the most prominent architects of London pointed out that the housing market was returned to normal levels in the south-east of England .
private homes in the capital have been hot and are the subject of enormous price rises , which the Bank of England found on the basis of widespread fear of a credit bubble , in June limits on mortgage credit .
Tony P@@ id@@ g@@ ley , founder and CEO of the high class construction company Berkeley said on Monday : `` Since the start of the current financial year , the market returned to normal transaction levels since the top of 2013 and added that this is a `` stable practice environment . &apos;&apos;
the real estate market in London was well placed during the downturn , as foreign buyers pushed to the capital .
the prices in the urban area increased by 18@@ 5 percent last year , far beyond the average increase in England and Wales as a whole .
the average sales prices rose to approximately one fifth in the past year , at the end of April .
however , a stronger pound has become less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them , even through the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible ` Vill@@ tax &apos; before the general elections in the coming May .
the London real estate broker warned in the past week that the mortgage market report for April was presented in the second half of the year in the second half of the year .
new data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decrease in mortgage approval in July , which also indicates that the housing market is cooled .
Hamp@@ tions International , a different real estate agency , corrected its forecast for the rise in housing prices in London for 2015 after 3 % , on the basis of a already weakened skin price of the skin .
the transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea , Pattaya and Kensington has fallen for a quarter for a quarter of year , as far as the broker WA Ell@@ is is concerned .
however , the desire for a home home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing , because the amount of money amounts to more than 2.2 billion .
Mr P@@ id@@ g@@ ley added : `` The demand for the right product in the best locations remained stable and remained as a result .
in June , the company reported that 3.@@ 7@@ 42 new homes had been sold during the year until the end of April - almost one-third more than the highest level in 2007 .
the annual contract earnings rose by 40 % to 280 million , the turnover of 18 percent to 1.6 billion .
in a communication on Monday before the annual assembly of the company , Mr P@@ id@@ g@@ ley told us that the revenue for Berkeley would be in the current market in the current year .
the analysts estimate that the annual pre-@@ tax result is paid to 450 million .
in February , in London there were a number of people in London .

songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
it was not prohibited - nothing was wrong - simply did not be played .
it has successfully become obsolete , as the word is obsolete .
the general taste was created , which would never have succeeded , and as people choose in books , the V@@ om@@ -T@@ eller choose to choose million@@ matic mem@@ o@@ irs , cooking books and love of love , so they have the ball@@ ads in the music .
in the euphoria of the day , K@@ inn@@ n began to play an imaginary piano .
A@@ il@@ inn did not understand that .
`` This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called F@@ ats W@@ aller , &apos;&apos; said he and her automatically two fingers to his lips .
that was what his father was doing to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth .
it started as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father was played with his own father .
if you want to put a word with a J , without putting two fingers over your lips , you will have a P@@ enny .
it was not a very funny game at that time , and it was still not very funny .
he knew that was expected to do so .
it had to explain what jazz was .
A@@ il@@ inn has never been part of this .
jazz , even if he was not directly prohibited , was not played .
what happened was not modern .
it was only a place for a single .
people wanted to be sure that they would end .

his in@@ predictability made people nervous .

though he was 10 years old , without being heard by Sam@@ my Davis Junior , K@@ inn@@ n knew about jazz from the half secret collection of his father .

music was an expression of love .
`` These are not really offensive , &apos;&apos; said K@@ inn@@ n .

he was too much , but the neglected garden gave him the misleading sense of security .

he wanted to say that it was a Ju@@ x , but in its present two fingers put to the lips .

maybe your buttons to have a little bit .
and you say that you hate me because my buttons are too thick ?
you hate ?
of course , I do not .
that is just the stupid song .
he could have said `` I love you , &apos;&apos; but it was too early .
`` Your thick buttons are precisely the reason why you miss me , &apos;&apos; trying to do it instead .
I am a bit of per@@ vers .
that is wrong .
it had to be com@@ ical .
if he tried to be com@@ ical , he often brought himself into trouble because he did not have the reassuring Char@@ m that he needed to hit the cruelty of cruelty .
perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he wanted to be .
in spite of his friendly eyes .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons was born in red and came out of her deck chair .
there was no excuse for him for him .
in her passion , she seemed to catch them , as Palm@@ w@@ el appeared in the storm .
`` and your pole head is precisely the reason why I feel you feel ye feel that `` she said them
that is not what I am .
she was tired of him , both for the unnecessary in@@ friendliness of his words and also for the fear of his eyes when she refused to go against him .
did she think that he would beat them ?
she did not tell him about the life of the cold northern archipelago , but he had no doubt that it was essentially here .
the same huge and polluted ocean broke out here , as it was there on the banks .
the same confusing men , with even more thick skin , took W@@ AR as their ancestors as they have been as a pig and beach rob@@ ber , W@@ AR went to pub to raise the hand against a woman who refused to commit themselves .
is there a lot of people in the world ?
these would have shown a thick mind if they did not meet !
you will only be able to jump the word for an erotic attraction between men and women .
after Ke@@ arity , this was unnecessary because it was already a act of violence .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons gave him a sign by her body .
he rose from the deck chair as a old man .
she also felt himself , but the amount of his anger surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew .
she saw him as to how he took himself in the upper floor .
Adam leaves the garden , thought .
she felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , though some raised their hands against them .
a man turned from her to resist his back , defeated , without fighting - why it was a sight that she seemed to know , if she could not remember a single time in which she had already seen it just before the day ?
when she was alone , A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons looked to her feet .
several years before the events that have just been raised , ES@@ ME has been working on a brief talk about the continued violence at low and medium-sized levels , in precisely the way in which their reduction has always been expected , in view of the money and energy that has been invested in the eradication of this violence .
`` It has long been done , and much needs to be done , &apos;&apos; she wrote , ` wrote them , `` to the feminist aggression of a people , led a thousand of wars , and gained the most of it , especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness has seldom been felt .
but there are a number of features .
the higher the church tower , the smaller the passion he continues .
the people of the people who live during the hearing are aware of stories , and they are aware of the virtues of marriage and family life , but yet not only the former crude as well as our urban fabric are also in the hands , but are also evidence of the emergence of a new and left dispute in the workplace , in the workplace , on the streets and even on the game fields .
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration , &apos;&apos; said her mentor , when he has read the whole report .
I suggest that you read less stories .
ES@@ ME Wal@@ ks cut their head to their head .
I have to ask : are you going to be A@@ thei@@ st ?
`` I believe that I do n&apos;t have to say , &apos;&apos; replied ES@@ ME Haf@@ baum .
are you lesbian ?
once again , ES@@ ME was calling for the right to privacy and refusal .
femin@@ ists ?
I would like to turn to silence .
`` I do n&apos;t wonder , &apos;&apos; said Luther Rab@@ ino@@ witz , that &apos;s because I would be against A@@ thei@@ sm , reading or feminism .
this is a decent job for us .
we serve a free society that is free of charge .
but certain types of hyper@@ sensitivity , which are absolutely acceptable and commendable , can sometimes distort the results you have presented .
they obviously have prejudices against the church , and these things that you call themselves `` empty &apos;&apos; and `` ro@@ h , &apos;&apos; could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a power and vitality of course .
if you go on to go out , the IST was executed as if it would happen if it had happened yesterday , that the country will have the essential power to live .
ES@@ ME Mount Tree saw himself , while Rab@@ ino@@ witz spoke .
behind his head he repeated a LED ad in Flam@@ ing@@ or@@ osa to give advice to O@@ f@@ now to the country in the last quarter .
smile to their neighbours , tell your partner , listen to your partner , listen to ball@@ ads , visit Music@@ als , tell your phone , talk to your phone , tell you , tell you , listen to , listen to , vote , forgive yourself .
talk is better than silence , the word word is better than the written word , but nothing is better than love .
`` I absolutely understand what you want , &apos;&apos; replied ES@@ ME What was sure she was sure that ye had to go to the end , &apos;&apos; and I say nothing other than that we are still not effective , as we ourselves do .
my concern is that , without prior warning , we will be able to find out how we repeat the mistakes .
this time , however , it is not the others in which we can give our anger and mistrust .
Luther Rab@@ ino@@ witz formed with the hands a pyramid .
in order to indicate a Engel@@ s@@ patient d .
`` You go too far , &apos;&apos; he said that if you call actions as an error , our grandparents maybe or even have not committed .
they go too far when you say that these `` anger &apos;&apos; and `` mistrust &apos;&apos; would have disappeared .
it should actually not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about understanding the past .
there was no ` us &apos; and there was no ` others &apos; .
it was a time of weakness , that is all we know .
`` From when we are honest about ourselves , ES@@ ME would prefer to say that there is no part of society to be able to behave .
I hate no one .
whether it was bad or good has happened .
that was at that time .
there is nothing more to say - and that is what we are agreed about .
and just as no fault needs to be assigned , there is also no fault to blame , if such relief would be appropriate and would be a way of til@@ ting them .
but what does the past do if we do not learn this ?
the past is that we forget them .
I would like to say something about this .
Luther Rab@@ ino@@ witz abandoned his pyramid .
`` I will remember her report , &apos;&apos; he said .
the next day , when she went to work , she was beaten by a motorcycle driver , who , as he described , was in a kind of `` brutal anger . &apos;&apos;
there are cases .
Les@@ o@@ tho@@ -@@ military member says that no coup was planned ; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
official representatives of the military began to have a coup to the collapse of the government and said that they went against police officers who are accused of military fanatics .
Prime Minister Thomas T@@ hab@@ ane fled from the country and admitted that the army of the country occupied its office of office .
the Premier brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa when he reported about terrorist threats .
military spokesman Major N@@ tl@@ ele N@@ to@@ i said that there was de facto no coup , that the military was acting on the threat by the police of the police .
`` What was happening this morning was that the head of the defence forces was in the police , after having received several secret service reports in the police that there are a number of elements within the police that actually wanted to arm some of the political , party political young fanatics , who are still suffering from war , &apos;&apos; said he against Voice of America .
the South African government spokesman C@@ lay@@ son Mon@@ y@@ ela said that the military action made the impression of a crash .
`` even if no one has claimed the government to be thrown away by violence , all the reports agree on the fact that the activities of the defense forces of Djibouti show signs of a coup d&apos;état , &apos;&apos; said he said .
speakers from the military of Ramallah passed on Sunday with the soldiers to go back in their homes and be able to stay in the capital .
in the meantime , the Deputy Minister of Mo@@ th@@ et@@ jo@@ ya takes over the government during T@@ hab@@ ane absence .
T@@ hab@@ ane told that he believes that he was founded on the basis of his attempt to combat corruption in the country .
since June , there have been great tension since June when T@@ hab@@ ane parliamentary meetings took place on the basis of the dispute in its uniform government .
he said that his actions would have failed to undermine the government .
production in the eurozone
the rise in production in the eurozone slowed down in August to the lowest point of the last 13 months .
in August , the final Mark@@ ite shopping directory fell to 5@@ 0.7 in August , after a booth of 5@@ 1.8 in July .
an indication about 50 adds to expansion .
new orders went back and experienced factories in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
the figures meet the meeting of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- on Thursday .
the markets expect a clear plan for dealing with a reluctant recovery of the eurozone , as well as threatening deflation at a rate of inflation .
there are speculation that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , could provide further information in the course of this week whether it would consider quantitative easing for the eurozone , in accordance with those carried out by the UK and the United States during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than not growth , the slow effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for the manufacturers have become clearer , &apos;&apos; said Rob Dob@@ son , senior economist at Mark@@ it .
the Fabri@@ k-@@ PM@@ I for Germany , the largest trading partner in Russia in the EU , fell to 5@@ 1.4 with 5@@ 1.4 .
in the meantime , the most important economic nation in the block , France , PM@@ I fell to 4@@ 6,@@ 9 .
France remains a land@@ lord , as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation .
evidence of the fact that growth incentives are no longer used in key industrial derivatives in Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are also not reassuring , as Mr Dob@@ son said .
the drop in industry is probably the fire of analysts that expect further monetary or fiscal incentives .
a positive message came from the Republic of Ireland , where PM@@ I increased to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Sisko , chief economic expert at I@@ HS Global , said : `` The best thing is to keep the sector going to grow .
it added : ` producers in the eurozone obviously find life difficult to achieve , given that the current geopolitical tensions are increasing - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - uncertainties in the difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and consumer confidence , and presumably leads to the fact that some orders are delayed or cancelled , especially in large orders .
he said that `` it would become more and more likely to call for the ECB to initiate a kind of QE , even though we suspect that this will be limited . &apos;&apos;
the survivors of Beslan died : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school , as the children themselves are still suffering today .
ten years ago , more than 1,000 people of Chechen militias were taken hostage in a school in Beslan .
more than 330 people , more than half of them , have been killed .
we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims .
exactly one decade after the appalling siege of the school of Beslan , with the 3@@ 34 people , the heroic survivors died last night before a new Apo@@ calyp@@ se in Ukraine .
as fanati@@ cal Islamist terrorists and parents on 1 September 2004 , at the beginning of a new school year , seemed like the evil of evil .
the tragedy united West and East in dis@@ repute , and turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery .
ten years later , we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims .
we found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hell is going to follow them .
your biggest hope ?
an end to the war that Ukraine is now dying .

my legs were over@@ flowing .
I stood on and went out to look for my mother .
a soldier brought them to security .

`` This tragedy changed my life , but it did not destroy me , &apos;&apos; she says .
that is what I have happened , and that can not be changed
once in the year I am always in the sports hall to remember those who stayed there .
my friends and I try to talk to others .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future class of Sis@@ era G@@ apo@@ eva was killed there .
we played together when we were small .
`` I do n&apos;t want to marry until I start studying my career .

she says that the siege will always remain a part of her , though the memory of each year will become somewhat weak .
I am glad that many people in the world remember our horror , and we are grateful for the help that we have received from people to the UK .
if I look at the photo of me as I return to the school , I think that many people see it for the first time , understand our disaster and help us not happen again .
the boy who fled through the balloon , believe that his mother was dead
it was his first school day -LRB- Russians go to school for 7 years -RRB- .
as a seven-@@ year , he said : `` I told me that I should put myself when there was an explosion .
after an explosion he thought she would die .
she said to him : `` Run .
full of fear , she could be dead , and saw on the path of a small child , took it in hand and fled by a ball ha@@ gel .
his father Vladimir , who joined his son outside , said : `` Dam@@ ir told me that his mother died .
he said : ` I could not save them .
in fact , Tam@@ ara was on the outside and in the hospital , in fact , in the assumption that her son was turned .
after their reunification , she said : `` I dream about joy .
I could not believe it .
he ran out and turned me to me .
Dam@@ ir later went to London -LRB- from the now opened newspaper News of the World -RRB- to get the title of a Bar@@ nar@@ do &apos;s Children &apos; Champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cher@@ ie .
`` This horror is followed by you every day , but I wish I could stop by remembering that he said yesterday .
but I can say that it is in my memory .
I know that I directly took up my toy gun .
but now I &apos;m able to play computer games and that is not a problem for me .
`` I &apos;m not afraid to go to the sports hall , but I do not think about myself .
I remember these children , whom I have played in the courtyard .
we never say that they have been killed or dead .
we say that they are in the sports hall .
I remember very well about my journey to London , especially on the toys , where I was able to choose what I wanted .
but now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine , where wars cause the kind of disaster that he and his friends have suffered .
this horror is followed every day , but I wish I could stop to remember that .
`` I &apos;m sorry about all those who are suffering from the dolphins , &apos;&apos; said Dam@@ ir , who worked in a monastery last week .
I would like to help .
I want to go to the police a day and I hope that she will take me next year in the training academy .
his mother Tam@@ ara , 48 , said : `` 37 children from our neighbourhood have been killed , that you can imagine ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there was simply no children who were able to go , and this silence took many months .
she remembers her journey to London with Dam@@ ir .
the people in London , when I told our story .
I understood how people can understand our feelings on the other side of the world .
she was grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004 .
I wish I could call Cher@@ ie , and you just say that 10 years have passed , but I still remember the meeting to her and to her husband in London , as the Dam@@ ir helped .
I remember how Dam@@ ir would like to eat Bor@@ sh and call them all the local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he played in a restaurant .
and that was just one month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British shared our pain and supported us .
she said : ` I always think that this world has not become better in these ten years .
the war is now going on in Ukraine , and every day people die , and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killed .
that is exactly what we have .
I think that for many of the war there is a part of the news they hear when they are bored or with something other than others .
I just know what these people feel .
and I ca n&apos;t stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people want to kill each other and that is sad .
Dam@@ ir was great and it is a very quiet and quiet boy , he is neither aggressive or angry .
he does not look for revenge , he is not over@@ thrown by the past Gre@@ u@@ ules .
I know that he does n&apos;t like to remember that , but he has six close friends from the class and they go occasionally in the sports hall and they destroy the candles .
when he was smaller , he suffered .
his eyes were open .
I would also like to remind myself how he did all his weapons and other military games .
I can hardly believe that I was so sure that he was dead , that he would never see him .
when I came to the legs , I saw the hell to share me .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell was able to survive .
`` I remember that I took him to him , `` Dam@@ ir , run away , &apos;&apos; but I was also sure that he had not heard me .
but he has heard it and he went away .
and so the life , unlike the many of others , go to us .
Georgi@@ j I@@ ly@@ in , 17
the Young , the terrible image after the siege to the symbol of the Gre@@ uel of Beslan
convenience : the Bes@@ lan@@ -@@ over@@ live Georgi@@ j Ly@@ in with his mother Hö@@ ma after the siege of 2004 , on the right of a picture of Georgi@@ j today
his bloo@@ ded face was painted by fear when he was able to live his life .
his image was one of the shocking symbols of the barbar@@ ity of Beslan .
his mother Hö@@ ma , 54 , had him for his first school day before she was in vain to bring her older son Vladimir to the university .
`` I left the courtyard for about two minutes before the terrorists went to him , and thus my little boy stayed for three terrible days , &apos;&apos; she remembers .
not only was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my Georgi@@ j managed to survive .
the closer to this date , the more serious it is to think and talk about it .
there is no single day to which we do not remember this tragedy .
we do not think that it is long , I think it would happen yesterday , some scenes from these days are following me forever .
nobody will forget that , and that is what I promise .
finally , the image of Georgi@@ j -LRB- the left -RRB- was one of the most shocking of the attack and was dismissed as a statue -LRB- right -RRB- .
I remember that Georgi@@ j wanted to go to school this day .
I knew that he was in life when I saw him on television .
and now there is even this statue of the vineyard in San Marino .
Georgi@@ j does not want to see the picture , and it is hidden in our book .
I understand that , but I also believe that the people of the world feel our pain .
Georgi@@ j says today : `` It is important that this can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we ever learn the truth .
people always investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth .
and now they investigate the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine .
will we ever know what it has caused ?
this world is becoming something of horror .
`` I can not understand how that is possible
for ten years , there is nothing to do with the pain .
we need dozens of years to forget a little bit .
it has attacked my health and I still feel it .
for about three or four years I had a couple of times because of the siege , but then it became better .
I went back to school in 2004 and feared every day .
I thought to my friends and class players who were killed .
that &apos;s why I come to the sports hall when the 1st September moves closer .
I would like to pay tribute to my old child .
it is hard for me to go to the sports hall , but I have to do it .
I do not feel as victims , this story is now a part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I am not .
my life goes on .
I completed the school this year and visit a medical school in W@@ ín@@ ka@@ w@@ ka@@ z .
I will become heart ch@@ ir@@ urg .
my first choice was education in the army .
I wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that did not happen .
Georgi@@ j Fan@@ i@@ ev , 20 .
the Young , though he was caught on the feet of a murderous terrorist was caught .
a miracle : Georgi@@ j Fan@@ i@@ ev was caught during the siege on the feet of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
during the siege he was caught in the sports hall .
it is really a miracle that he was not killed .
`` We feel as if it would have been yesterday , &apos;&apos; says Georgi@@ j , who wanted to go to the FSB , because of his health damage .
it is still with me , it is not what I have left behind me .
I &apos;m older and people say that children can easily handle serious experiences - I have to say , but that is true .
`` In 2006 I worked with psych@@ ologists and I really felt a bit better , but I can not forget it
and I would like to forget .
in 2005 - this was the first and only time that I went to the sports hall .
I lost the awareness .
I will never go back again and ask me not to show you where I have been sitting in this famous picture .
so@@ wn : Georgi@@ j Fan@@ i@@ ev today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
my pain is immense and I wear it every day with me .
my friends know that I do n&apos;t like to talk about it and they never asked about school .
physically , it is good to me .
I should be careful about my injured age , but I can now run well .
but because of my health , I was not able to study the secret service academy of the FSB in Saint Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have sent my documents , the medical sent and they have replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have had two years behind me .
he learns the treatment of all animals &apos;&apos; from cats to calves .
he said : `` I knew that I never wanted to report to my children .
children should not know anything and they should not .
his mother Marina , 42 , said : `` This pain leaves me never .
he is in my soul worse when the anniversary moves closer .
I am going to go to the celebrations .
I know that Georgi@@ j will not go .
it has to be much more intense because it was there .
I waited home to him and was unable to help .
I am grateful to God for being returned to me .
it remains in us .
Georgi@@ j is now a adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept that if something is met .
he is a boy , he like sport , but he can not participate on his knees
he has been operating on several occasions , it can run , but there will be no sport .
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50 % , but you never forget that .
this terrible experience will always follow us .
many friends and neighbours have been killed during the siege , and that only strengthens my pain .
I have lost many people who I knew very much .
my son is in me , and that is the greatest gift that God was able to make me , but my heart of the wine is about the rice .
I know of families in which new children have been born .
it is difficult to accept that life continues , even if that does not want .
I will never forget my heart in me when I saw him in the hospital .
and now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why do they kill each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and I can not believe that
we have been a friendly country in the past , as can be that we are now fighting ?
people and children are suffering , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and are still being killed .
as far as we are concerned , if all of these are going to go , it will be possible to go as far as possible .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos .
if you want to make photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the most expensive option is a water density Point And@@ -S@@ ho@@ ot , like the Nikon Coolpix AW@@ 120 or a Ac@@ tion-@@ Cam as the Go@@ Pro heroin 3 + Silver Edition , which are both for about 300 .
I have added these photos to a family with several cameras that are available for a price of less than 350 .
irrespective of the equipment , there are a few rules for the best results .
control your equipment twice .
even if you have a water density camera , you will be sure to have the battery .
place your camera on the photos or videos that you want to start .
a number of cameras and cameras have been optimized for the background of the exposure time .
and before you jump , check what depth of your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others to 50 or 60 feet .
search in our shopping guide and ratings for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models .
make multiple pictures - because many are not .
reference cameras have an LCD that allows you to create images .
even if you have a LCD , it is difficult to look at this .
so make a lot of pictures .
when your camera has a friction mode , you can use it with a series of recordings with slightly modified exposure settings .
stay close to the surface .
the light is dramatically worse , as long as you remove yourself from the surface .
if possible , you will stay close to the surface if you make pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to bring more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
it is also a good Council , but it is all the more important for the poor light conditions .
it is especially important if you work with a Ac@@ tion-@@ Cam : these devices often have a fixed wide angle , which means that you have to go to your objects when filling out the whole image wire .
Andrew Law@@ son was a man of the variety whose character changes things , even in a gigantic organization like the N@@ HS .
he devoted his career to the patient to avoid the disease .
under his patient , his wife was a MI@@ 6-@@ employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture .
Law@@ son knew that the doctors are important to the diagnosis and diseases , while the treatment is mainly dealt with with something quite different : pain .
one day in 2007 he was the one whose head began .
`` I did not feel me , &apos;&apos; he wrote in May this year .
I have had difficulties to get rid of me .
while he fought with the gri@@ p@@ pe@@ like symptoms , he noticed that he made his wife Juli@@ et impati@@ ently .
`` I want to know everything immediately than later .
when Juli@@ et was on a business trip for a week , Law@@ son felt un@@ lucky and without reason concerned .
something was in the air .
he asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his breast .
it was only two weeks ago that he was in the French Alps .
the result of the X-ray examination was taken .
he suffered from Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , an explosive cancer that attacks the c@@ ings to the skin .
as with most cancers , the precise trigger is usually hard to determine .
for example , a few smokers of lung cancer have not been ill .
but Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is different .
in almost all cases , the trigger is an asynchron@@ ous load - contact with the fiber tree , which was once recognized as deadly .
for the majority of us , Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is a disease that can be ignored .
asbestos is ultimately a product of the past .
the most dangerous asbestos type has no longer been used in the UK since the 1960s when the industry has voluntarily committed itself to using them .
also , where he was still employed , only people worked directly with the substance - plum@@ bers , construction workers , rooms and advertising workers for instance .
as an industrial hazardous material from a different time , it seems to me to be a cause for concern .
but this self-@@ satisfaction is inappropriate .
Britain , it seems , today is the highlight of a Mes@@ ol@@ onic epidemic .
there are more deaths by Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die on this disease as traffic accidents .
annual figures of the Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om@@ to@@ des@@ y since 1980 , in the aftermath of future deaths in the UK
the reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now , although asbestos has been illegal for years -LRB- in 1999 -RRB- , it is that a Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is only being developed for decades .
and the scourge of the Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is not limited to former workers in the construction industry .
asbestos was , and often still , in the houses in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we are learning and shopping .
and therefore Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om does not know class barriers , financial boundaries , jobs or age .
the privileged Bas@@ tions , from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools , are not a protective room .
the parliamentary buildings have been contaminated .
even in the hospitals , in which we are going to be healthy , there has already been a result of the legacy of this deadly massacre .
Andrew Law@@ son was not old .
he was also no plum@@ ber .
it was indeed difficult to imagine where he might have been able to contact asbestos .
then he found it .
`` It looks as if there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels when I graduated for six years .
all - students , nurses , doctors , and Pf@@ ör@@ tner - use the tunnel .
one wonders how many people are suffering from the same illness ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer this question at least in part .
`` From the four doctors who have been trained in the Guy &apos;s Hospital , and the last five years of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , &apos;&apos; he wrote in a letter , `` I &apos;m the last who is still living . &apos;&apos;
how many of what are we going to do ?
at Andrew Law@@ son , Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was diagnosed in the age of 48 years .
when he died on 17 February this year , he was 5@@ 5 .
that was an unusually long survival time .
fifty per cent die within 8 months after the diagnosis .
the disease is always fatal .
we can therefore only repeat the question of Law@@ son : ` how many of what are we going to do ? &apos;
the leading expert of the UK for Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , Professor Julian Pe@@ to takes the view that , between 1870 and 2050 , when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to end , 9@@ 50,000 of the disease will be lost .
most of these still have no idea that they will die .
an asynchron@@ ous mine in Quebec , Canada
a short look at the files of the dishes to which the people concerned are often looking for damages show how far the scourge of the Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms is already spread .
in June this year , Marks &amp; Spencer , for example , have been exposed to asbestos .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years ago when she started her business at M &amp; S .
now she has two children in the vicinity .
`` This is what she says , `` I never heard of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , but I did n&apos;t really know something about asbestos .
I would never have thought that this would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the concept of asbestos does not include a substance but a group of six minerals .
the name of the word comes to a description of the fibre structure , which makes the material resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
Chr@@ y@@ so@@ til , also known as white asbestos , is now far from the most frequently found asbestos in buildings .
it was used for roof plates , floor plates , pipe insulation , wall insulation , and even for brake pads in cars .
it is less deadly than other asthma forms , but it is regarded as a `` big health risk &apos;&apos; by the EU and the WHO .
however , the most dangerous is the brown asbestos and the blue asbestos -LRB- Kro@@ ky@@ do@@ li@@ th -RRB- .
Britain was once the world &apos;s largest importer , and experts suspect that `` it was clear , but indirect evidence suggests that this was a main reason for the uniquely high Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om@@ rats . &apos;&apos;
a staff of Marks &amp; Spencer was held in the flagship store in Oxford Street , London , asbestos .
Jan@@ ice Allen has perhaps not seen himself as a typical Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om@@ age , but the work of Julian Pe@@ to suggests that their history is far from unusual .
he has put forward a study of the people affected , showing that `` a significant proportion of the Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ ome has been caused by the environment .
a large proportion of these contacts are based on the `` normal use and aging &apos;&apos; of our buildings .
it looks as if no one can expect to be sure .
a report by Captain Consulting , who studied the Palace of Westminster , shows how people could have been exposed to the substance in the hearts of the government .
in 2009 , he reported that the services were contaminated with asbestos behind the committees of Parliament .
Members of Parliament are often accused of dealing with their own interests , but that is where the opposite is true .
while the management of the Parliamentary Employment Service insisted that the Western National Palace has received a `` clean health certificate &apos;&apos; , it is now no doubt that 1 billion of work needs to be spent over several years to modernise Parliament , modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos .
the Apo@@ rian report also pointed out that ` the presence of asbestos was not carried out in accordance with the respective provisions .
nobody can know whether this mis@@ management will cost life .
all we can do is to wait .
a person who has never been able to understand the contact with asbestos is Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t , a general physician .
like Andrew Law@@ son , he claims that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
`` I worked in a hospital , it was decided to be positive , &apos;&apos; but I ca n&apos;t prove it in my case .
it is difficult to remember all the places in which you have worked .
as far as he is concerned , the day is early December 2009 , in which he got a kind of fever .
he was 45 , and just late in the evening he had a surgery .
suddenly , I had the courage to hide .
it was suddenly .
I felt terrible .
I believed that the journey will no longer be created .
as a doctor Ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain of the breast , the skin came up around his c@@ ings .
but , like Jan@@ ice Allen , he had no reason to suspect .
he did not work for a month .
doctors made X-ray recordings of his breast , and Ple@@ ur@@ ak@@ ath@@ e@@ ther to test liquid from the c@@ ings , and testing in the laboratory .
but his complaints remained without diagnosis .
his health improved , and he returned to his job .
however , from time to time , the symptoms returned to life , often according to sporting activity .
in 2011 , a patient was diagnosed with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om .
but as far as it is concerned , it does not work with his own case .
after all , his patient has been older and has worked directly with asbestos .
the connection in the case was clear .
in September 2011 , Ab@@ bot@@ ts deteriorated and his owner brought to a group of users .
in December 2011 , exactly two years after Ab@@ bot@@ t felt sick for the first time was introduced with a camera in the cave between the reefs and the breast .
I am an optim@@ ist .
mostly , I say he says .
to be honest , I did not have so many concerns .
but Rachel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of the biotechnology was in the week between Christmas and New Year : `` You told me that it was Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om .
Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t : diagnosis Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om
suddenly , Ab@@ bot@@ t had dates with Mac@@ mil@@ lan@@ -@@ nurses , who recommended him to take a lawyer .
first , it is the scale of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings , where pipes were often isolated with asbestos . &apos;&apos;
the people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings now fall .
and thus Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om meets younger people who did not work in the typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes in hospitals in hospitals under the earth , therefore , patients have probably not been exposed to the substance .
but many employees who would like to change from one building to another -LRB- like Andrew Law@@ son -RRB- or in underground cant@@ ines -LRB- as it often did -RRB- , came with the greatest probability in contact with the toxic substances .
it shows that , over several decades , hospitals could have been life-@@ saving for patients .
it is still being removed today .
students raised their Bun@@ sen@@ burning on the end of the company .
and it does not just affect hospitals .
asbestos was often used in offices , shops , libraries and cities .
also schools .
indeed , many people have probably had the first asthma contact in the classroom .
everywhere in the country , in thousands of chemical patients , students have left their Bun@@ sen@@ burning on asbestos .
on web pages , the subject of asbestos is often raised in schools .
and meanwhile , as innocent items are included in our homes such as floor plates or sho@@ pp@@ end@@ rooms by the use of asbestos .
`` It is a industri@@ alist that is included in large parts of our properties , &apos;&apos; commented Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew Law@@ son in his process against Guy &apos;s Hospital .
in one case , the only contact taken by a woman concerned was in the 1970s .
therefore , as you want , you will be able to turn your clothes .
the effects of diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is fatal is immense .
`` It takes a while to process , &apos;&apos; says Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t .
I went to work and tried to do further , but I noticed that I could not focus on what I did .
I was in practice two weeks .
then I knew that I had to deal with myself .
yes , I &apos;m not going to experience Christmas .
the greatest difficulty was to change the perspectives from the position of a physician .
as many patients reminded him , he reminded himself of the way in which he was able to meet from all the information he had to meet .
`` It was very difficult to include everything , &apos;&apos; says he .
`` I asked my doctor how long I have ? &apos;
and there were about 12 months .
I remember that I thought that I will not experience another Christmas .
that was what happened .
Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is especially popular because it is our life treatment mechanism - the breathing itself - that the deadly cancer is caused .
the majority cases of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om are caused by asthma .
asbestos consists of smallest fibres .
when the asbestos is captured and the fibres are used , they can be placed in the breast .
asthma fibres confuse the breast skin and can trigger cell mut@@ ations .
`` The problem is caused by the ingredients used in the body , with the same name as Professor Tom Treas@@ ure , a heart Thor@@ ax@@ -@@ physician who changed to the Guy &apos;s Hospital in 2001 .
it is precisely the hospital that Andrew Law@@ son claims that it is exposed to asbestos .
Treas@@ ure knew Law@@ son and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training .
as soon as the asthma tissue reaches the lung tissue , rulers say that they are pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is .
from the very beginning , it is from the beginning .
the usual options in other cancers do not work in Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om .
for instance , the effectiveness of a surgery is hot .
some believe that they are worth trying .
it is the only thing that unites the people of the world .
`` He can not cut the breast skin , &apos;&apos; it says
they do not come with the knife .
meanwhile , the cancer does not talk very well to chem@@ otherapy .
`` sometimes there are long-term over@@ living , &apos;&apos; says Treas@@ ure .
but at the end all of them die .
fortunately , some patients are actually living long , much longer than that .
the author of Stephen Newton died 20 years after the diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t is still struggling .
after contacting Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , Ab@@ bot@@ t was in contact with Andrew Law@@ son , the four years after his diagnosis .
`` hello , cancer , &apos;&apos; said that he was happy to meet .
`` He was very positive , &apos;&apos; says Ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had received his diagnosis 4 years and was still very active .
originally , Ab@@ bot@@ t was offered six chem@@ otherapy cycles , which would only be extended by a month .
`` I was desperate , &apos;&apos; he says .
I wanted to give up .
however , Law@@ son managed to show things in a rather positive light .
after the advice of several doctors , Ab@@ bot@@ t decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Lo@@ ic Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ yel@@ ski .
`` We had an advantage that I had to quote .
a normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of treatment .
money is essential for test patients in order to be able to perform the best available therapies .
but if these treatments fail to fail , many are concerned about the future of the families that leave them .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Law@@ son contacted Andrew Morgan of Field LEASING Water@@ house LL@@ P .
`` It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health , &apos;&apos; says Morgan .
but what changed in the 1960s was that you realized that a health risk was also very low .
and here the negligence of companies began to play .
Andrew Law@@ son and Guy &apos;s Hospital eventually found their case , but it was not what Morgan called for full compensation , &apos;&apos; Law@@ son was unable to prove absolute certainty that his Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was due to the use of the guy .
after the investigation to his death , a speaker of the guy &apos; confirmed that `` the asbestos fibres have been removed in the cellar area in the 1990s . &apos;&apos;
that was too late for Andrew Law@@ son .
how asbestos can be removed
in fact , it is a huge problem that leads to compensation .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who defend themselves against claims know that time is for them .
as a response to this , there were significant new legislation in this year that makes it easier to collect compensation , even if their previous employers are no longer .
the law has acquired a fund sponsored by the insurance industry from 350 million to all that was diagnosed after July 2012 .
in these cases , the plain@@ tiff will receive 80 % of what a court could have been able to talk about them - about 120@@ ,000 .
about 300 successful applications in the program are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks that 350 million people are living in the insurance industry for 350 million .
`` This is a deal of insurance for insurers , &apos;&apos; says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers have had to pay , if the time would have to fail and would be able to keep the company normal to the company .
Mike also said that the law was not perfect .
but , like Morgan , it is necessary to carry out rapid action every day in the face of seven deaths .
`` The people are suffering so much and today need help , &apos;&apos; said Pe@@ ing during the second hearing of the Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om Act in December last year .
at that time , Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t has been in the hands of Prof. Lo@@ ic Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ yel@@ ski for 19 months .
after its first consultations , Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ yel@@ ski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treas@@ ure .
this was accompanied by radiation treatment and chem@@ otherapy .
Ab@@ bot@@ t felt strengthened .
`` This is of course the most important , &apos;&apos; says Ab@@ bot@@ t .
that is what patients see .
there is something about what you are going to go on .
if you look at you , it &apos;s very fast .
Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t went to the surgery in March 2012 .
at the end of August he went to the last of the six chem@@ otherapy cycles .
in the past , there were no signs of the disease .
then , in March 2014 , I had a scan .
there have been several cancers around my breast .
I was just going to 50 .
that is not sustainable .
that is what is happening .
once again , Ab@@ bot@@ t moved to six chem@@ otherapy cycles .
now there is no trace of the tum@@ ors .
but the process is physically and mentally very demanding .
you have to think about practical things - about the money if I &apos;m no longer , for example .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they have to look to the future .
as father of El@@ lie , 16 , and Tam@@ sin , 14 , this is not always easy .
`` He is difficult to say , &apos;&apos; says he .
it is hard to know what one is going to say .
when I received my first diagnosis , I told my girl that I would have a disease with which I would not be old .
they reacted differently .
Tam@@ sin is very close to you .
she told her friends and we soon got very many calls .
El@@ lie was cautious .
she did not say much .
such discussions are something that needs to be carried out by all cancer patients .
however , such talks are not surrounded by hope , not from a track of hope to survival .
the disease -LRB- as was ultimately the case for Stephen Newton -RRB- will bring about a high level of security .

China is refusing Hong Kong law on government elections , demonstrators
on Sunday , the Chinese Parliament decided against democratic reform against the nomination of candidates for the elections by Hong Kong .
this procedure was probably announcing the protests in Hong Kong for the long time , while activists are in the process of planning and mobilising within a few hours .
the decision of the Chinese People &apos;s Congress allows the Communist leaders to be able to reject all non-@@ p@@ ek@@ ing@@ loyal candidates .
`` This does not happen unexpectedly , but it does make us angry , &apos;&apos; said the legal expert of Lars y L@@ au , chairman of the Democratic Party .
that is not what Beijing promised .
there were the inhabitants of Hong Kong .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
in its defence of the Chinese decision , Li F@@ ei , vice president of the Standing Committee of the National People Congress , said that the approval of public nominations would be chaotic in the elections for the Hong Kong Government .
since 1997 , when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese , Beijing has promised to elect the residents from 2017 .
the Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough , but the decision makes it clear that the Chinese leadership retains the process through a nominal nomination committee controlled by Beijing .
after a new clause , only candidates are to be admitted with love for the country and love of Hong Kong .
the decision follows a summer , in which some of the largest and ad hoc protests took place in Hong Kong for several years .
behind the pro-@@ democratic campaign in Hong Kong , the movement of Occup@@ y Central is in favour of Love and Peace , whose organizers have threatened to escape the financial district , if Beijing does not allow any real general vote .
on Sunday evening , within a few hours after the announcement , hundreds were gathered in Hong Kong about the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
in the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement reached a new level civilian disorder and planned protest waves in the coming weeks .
but they have failed to prevent problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organizers shared that the movement of `` the occupation of the Central District has only been considered as the last resort , an action that should only take place when all dialogue options are exhausted and does not have any other choice .
we are sorry to say that all the dialogue has been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place .
the authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for the announcement of Beijing for the past days , and they were held on Sunday before the government building .
the riots are reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their town .
the movement of people from the mainland strengthens the competition for products and services .
in addition , the fear that the values of Hong Kong like democracy and free speech begin under the growing pressure of Beijing are beginning .
some of them criticised the demonstrations of the occupation of the occupation because they are dangerous to business - the life of Hong Kong .
`` The protests they are talking about may cause great economic damage , depending on how many people are involved and how long they continue , &apos;&apos; said legal expert Reg@@ ine I@@ p , who has long criticised the movement .
there are no fears about Hong Kong .
that impression is bad for investment .
the state-@@ controlled media in China recently reported about the democratic activists in Hong Kong than by Western powers .
in this summer , activists organised an unofficial referendum on electoral rights in excess than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
in July , tens of thousands took part in the history of the region .
the tradition of school disputes in the United States is now transmitted to universities , where they are offered by private aircraft .
we are pleased to be able to respond to this demand .
in order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the company also offers transportation prices such as private aircraft , helicopter .
Mr Stewart also admitted that the service had a security problem .
this service is an ideal alternative for students .
together with our new V@@ IF@@ -@@ options we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury .
a corporate speaker said that no new reservation was added , because the service was only just introduced , but added that `` students would book the service in the next weeks .
the company also admitted that there is a market for this offer .
students today distinguish between their expectations and the demands of students before 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years - it &apos;s important for you to make a great first impression , and with VI@@ F you can exactly do that .
however , the National student union criticised the Service .
Meg@@ an Dunn , Vice-President of the N@@ US for higher education , said : `` This offer seems to be totally separate from the life of the majority of students .
many students who start this month by studying are faced with a crisis of life costs because the available financial assistance in the form of credits and grants does not keep with the heavily rising invoices for the easiest conditions of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something less than the arrival in the student residence .
femin@@ ists criticise racial matters and police behaviour after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on
the un@@ armed teenagers were killed by police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on at the beginning of this month .
the participants raised their hands in the air and in the hands , `` hands high , not shooting , `` while they were waiting for the fruit .
after two weeks of protests in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mon , because of the killing of the un@@ armed teen@@ ager Michael Brown , the Blog@@ er Mi@@ ri@@ am Zo@@ ila Per@@ ez noticed a change to the online discussion white femin@@ ists .
after their experience , white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequality .
while the tensions in the Middle West , however , grew and respected throughout the country , Per@@ ez saw the answers of white women to 100 % of the race .
in comparison with the answers black women , shortly after the shots of 9 August , the personal essays with titles such as `` thoughts about F@@ erg@@ us@@ on by a white woman &apos;&apos; turned to the oppression of women relatively late .
but for Per@@ ez this was an important change .
`` I do not believe that one finds many people who speak about the white .
people felt themselves to be able to express themselves .
it is characteristic of the crisis in which we are , because the situation in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is so ethn@@ ically that they have to express that .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has brought F@@ erg@@ us@@ on to the light in the cultural area , for English professors from the Ohio State University , on the issues of light that are exposed to black American players .
`` I can publish something on Facebook about me and my partner will publish and get 150 li@@ kes of all of them , &apos;&apos; said Mitchell .
if I have something about how Far@@ ses are under siege in their own country , the silence is empty .
`` How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship ? &apos;&apos; she wondered .
for black women like Mitchell , the race , gender , and sexuality , there is no poet between racial and gender problems .
for them , black women have not had the luxury to separate the themes ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women now combine race and gender in the feminist mainstream , Angela H@@ last@@ y , Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mas@@ on University say that their predecessors did the opposite .
`` There were at least 10,000 black men and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman , &apos;&apos; said H@@ last@@ y .
white women had to be involved in history .
for H@@ last@@ y , the division between white and black women came to the point , with the white fighters in the country in the late years of the 19th century , demonstrating that the battle for the right to vote could only be successful for each group : women or Black .
`` You met the decision to stand up for female representation , and the right to vote for black should come later , &apos;&apos; said H@@ last@@ y .
if you remember such things , you will realise why coloured women do not trust white women .
we have not done our job well .
we have never helped black women to protect their hus@@ bands and sons .
even after women received the right to vote , there was still a decade to which white women organized against the sperm in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lyn@@ ching .
the group was born almost 40 years after the original request for the help of pages of black women .
for Mitchell is the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by F@@ erg@@ us@@ on - police behaviour , racial discrimination - a mirror of time , in which white femin@@ ists played with the problems with which black women have been affected by generations .
`` It would not be great if the activist activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to the education of a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception . &apos;&apos;
femin@@ ists of the second generation trying to understand what that means .
the well-known white feminist activist took part two weeks after the discovery of Michael Brown on Facebook and published an important article by Reb@@ ecca Car@@ roll , the slogan of the Guardian , in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on racism .
`` I hope that women , who have another , have the danger of understanding the body .
though St@@ ein is in the field of more inter@@ sec@@ tional feminism , just like gender issues , some of their comments about the race in America are still being confused .
Cristina Summer , research director of the American Enterprise Institute and author of the People &apos;s Republic said to the People that young men in the United States , in particular as their sisters , `` but Stein@@ ems comments to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on in contrast to their earlier criticism .
there are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women .
but when the White House recently set up a small program , My Brother &apos;s Ke@@ eper , put in to help the most vulnerable young black and tribal men , gave it great reactions of many femin@@ ists , including Gloria St@@ ein .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem .
when the US border police took up almost 6@@ 3,000 un@@ attended minors on the southern coast of the country this year , the issue of immigration reform is once again on the surface - this time as a female .
Andrea Merc@@ ado , co-@@ chairman of We Bel@@ ong , a organization that mobilised women for immigration reform , said that she would simply publish the stories of immigrant women .
`` These speak for themselves , &apos;&apos; said Merc@@ ado .
if the vast majority of labor visas go to male immigrants , the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories can be found in the women &apos;s women , &apos;&apos; said she .
the `` pig house &apos;&apos; in Ip@@ sw@@ ich is available for sale .

to the details there was a picture of the living room of the house - with one of them that had his head on a sofa .
real estate broker Conn@@ ell said that the pig was the pet of the owner .
`` The photo was accidentally published , and it was now `` said &apos;&apos; a speaker of the company .
in the portrait of the house , Conn@@ ell described the former as a `` unique family house with a bedroom . &apos;&apos;
while the broker has removed the image from the site , it appears on advertising material .
in the social media , domestic sales have been interested in interest in the social media than some wondered whether the pig would be included in the purchase price .

however , the happy winner needs to be informed .

Le@@ oni@@ das
not only the gran@@ ators were wet in Mat@@ sch at the first Rhine at the first end of the Rhine , in the area of the park .
but the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract yesterday as far as 1000 visitors .
there have been a colourful friction of illustrations , performances , games , exhibitions , and information about the times of the Romans and their significance for the Rhin@@ eland .

it was followed by the `` Es@@ ed@@ ari@@ i &apos;&apos; with a chest of chest , short legs , and fl@@ aps .
especially impressive was the appearance of the `` Pas arius , &apos;&apos; which took place against the `` Sec@@ utor , &apos;&apos; and recently fought the Bur@@ schen on the ground .
as a result , the heavy metals in the sky were filled up by the arena that there could be a fear and a ban@@ ge to get the health of the flower .
but on that , the imposing `` Sum@@ ma Ru@@ dis , &apos;&apos; was always an eye of attention .
`` We wanted to revive the Roman daily routine and to experience the culture of the Roman era , &apos;&apos; explained Chelsea Eus@@ kirchen , Chairman of the organizer of `` Friends of Roman Channel , &apos;&apos; the intention behind the spectacle .
after two years of preparatory time , the park was used for one day a `` O@@ pp@@ i@@ bel Roman , &apos;&apos; a Roman town such as Vice President of the Lord , in his welcome word .
after all , the Romans have not just brought war and conquest in our region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we admire today .
the remains of these were also admired at the Roman day , for example , `` Aqu@@ o@@ co marble &apos;&apos; from the eleven high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridge , which was once at the end of the city .
the troika society was once and now faced with the water and energy supply , and now she knew : `` We are still making use of the knowledge from that time .
this has also been confirmed by the Bachelor of Excellence by the `` Engineering Team Two &apos;&apos; from Rhein@@ bach , by the Romans , as Chor@@ ob@@ at , Gro@@ ma or Di@@ op@@ tra .
the Roman villa in Blan@@ ken@@ heim presented the exhibits and models of the excavations , as well as bricks made from the original hypo@@ tru@@ est , the hot air juice that was once the Roman villa .
there were also the foot@@ prints left by Wolf and Fuchs two years ago in the foot@@ ings before they were turned out .
in 2011 , the office for floor buildings had the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park of North in Rhein@@ bach .
you have found a division of an economic building with a Dar@@ re for drying from cereals and to the M@@ äl@@ zen .
the building has probably belonged to a Villa Rus@@ tica , an agricultural commodity .
a series of sites from these excavations took them in a glass of fruits , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate hal@@ ace .
the Villa has probably existed from the first to the fourth century , until the fall of the German@@ en in the early Roman Rhine .
in their work , the children are also with the Roman wind of wind , in the same way that the Roman students wrote their names .
at the stand of the Roman thermal baths , the children could have themselves finding themselves at the stand of the glass museum of Rhein@@ bach glass mosaic , and at the stand of the natural center of Ei@@ fel Net@@ ter@@ sheim to use a heavy wheat mill from stone to show the flour for a floppy or a cereals .
with the old town of Rome , the visitors went through the park and returned to the impressive booth of the city .
with a Roman week from 13th to 21 September , the municipality of Len@@ t@@ berg will also present itself to the Rhine region in 2014 to remember the death of Emperor Prince 2000 years ago .
together with the home history and historical history , Ober@@ bach@@ em will be able to remind you about the history of the city .
for example , a Roman leg@@ ion@@ ist of his work will tell us about his work on the farm , presenting plants from the Roman era and finding a funny lesson in the field of international understanding .
within the framework of a project , the primary school of the city is devoted to the Roman theme .
with the Roman Week , the numerous , but often not more visible traces will be made possible by the Romans in Wach@@ t@@ berg .

Emer@@ ola : the epidemic of Western Africa
the E@@ bol@@ a-@@ epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are being orphaned - and international companies go to distance .
the devastating E@@ bol@@ a-@@ epidemic is a serious blow to the economy of Western Africa .
the harvest rot@@ ates on the fields , the mines are left and the markets were orphaned - the virus has made the region difficult .
there are also a number of international companies that go to distance .
`` The E@@ bol@@ a-@@ epidemic is not just a medical crisis , but also an economic , &apos;&apos;
Liberia on the hardest
`` It is a total disaster , we lose very much money , &apos;&apos; says Al@@ ha@@ ji Bam@@ ogo , who sold on the second largest market in Liber@@ ias capital Mon@@ ro@@ via clothing .
on the market , only those who want to buy foods want to buy .
Liberia was hit hardest by the virus , and the fever fell more than 600 people .
recently , the health authorities declared that the disease was put in place in every corner of the country .
the virus was also spread in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria .
in total , more than 1500 people , thousands of others , died .
foreign companies prefer employees out of business .
everywhere in the resource-@@ rich countries , companies rely on their operations .
foreign companies such as the Steel Group of Arcel@@ or Mittal prefer their employees to fly several international airlines .
the local traders and farmers are also reacting : only a few of them are leaving their home sites to try out .
in a number of areas in Sierra Leone , Liberia , which are under quarantine , are being wiped out among others for the export of important cocoa and coffee beans on the fields .
farmers do not dare to leave their homes .
food
`` The people are always going to travel , &apos;&apos; says Phil@@ li@@ pe De V@@ re@@ yer , Paris expert for the economy of Western Africa .
the man , for instance , who normally goes to the market and sells its vegetables , would rather be able to stay .
the population will therefore feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently : food is scarce .
on the markets , stocks of basic foodstuffs such as rice are being destroyed .
at the same time , the region heavily affected by international companies is a kind of image , with far-reaching consequences .
the biggest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time .
it is crucial how far the virus is spread and how long the virus is going to spread .
in the event of investors , the impression is that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea , Sierra Leone , and Liberia
the disease is also burdened by the harsh state budgets in the Member States .
the disease also affects the states that have already been affected .
the rating agency &apos;s rating agency fears that their budgets are heavily dealt with by the high spending on the health system and in addition to the deteriorating economy .
the African Development Bank has already promised the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars -LRB- 45 million euros -RRB- .
the effects are also reflected in Nigeria , where there have been only a few EIB cases .
the oil-@@ rich region in southern Niger has not been affected .
but elsewhere , many people are afraid of fear of contagion .
reservations are also clearly returned in hotels .

NATO does not want agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia through the Ukrainian crisis as a result of the Ukrainian crisis .
NATO Secretary General Fo@@ gh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is in the founding agreement of the NATO Convention of NATO in 1997 .
the NATO leader , however , accused of Russia `` a sharp attack of the deal . &apos;&apos;
`` Today we have to look to the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner
from documents and opinions by the Russian side , `` that they consider us as an opponent .
increasing NATO
Mr Rasmussen has also announced that the NATO presence in Eastern Europe should be strengthened .
one in the NATO summit in Wales will make sure that `` we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is needed , &apos;&apos; said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels .
Kiev and Moscow
Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas strikes .
the negotiations took place for next Saturday , said the Russian energy minister Alexander No@@ wa@@ k on Monday .
it will wait for a decision of the European Union whether it would also send a representative to the talks .

the latest was that the EU &apos;s Energy Commissioner has given rise to research between both sides .
Ukraine has warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supplies for Europe .
Europe refers to a third of its earth gas from Russian sources , with a large proportion of Ukraine .
Merkel speaks of power : toll will be `` clear &apos;&apos;
now the Chancellor is aware of this .
but there is not a free letter for all the complicated details .
the conservative concerns from the CDU against the car toll toll have become much more powerful .
Chancellor Angela Merkel talked about a power word for the introduction of a car toll toll .
`` To tell you clearly : you are in the coalition agreement , and she will come , &apos;&apos; the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CD@@ U-@@ top committees in Berlin .
on a detailed model , however , Merkel failed .
certain parameters have been referred to in the black@@ -@@ red government programme .
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dob@@ rin@@ dt -LRB- Christian Democrats -RRB- has made a proposal and will continue to work .
however , the Cold League insists on its no toll on all roads .
Merkel also stressed the advice for a bill in the discussions on a draft bill .
in addition to the theme , he has also spoken about further opportunities to enable more private capital for investment in infrastructure .
`` There was nothing special about this , &apos;&apos; says a `` mirror &apos;&apos; report on Sunday , his house reviewed its own concept to pay for motorway investors with toll revenue - after the election of 2017 .
it was then warned about developing toll concepts against the responsible minister .
CD@@ U-@@ edge vi@@ ze Ar@@ min reaffirmed his objections .
`` The coalition contract never went out of it , said all the cross and federal roads that said that the North American CD@@ U@@ land leader said .
in this respect , it is an important signal that hake has now announced to talk about the subject .
resistance to the plans is also caused by the CD@@ U@@ land associations of Baden-Württemberg and the Rhin@@ eland .
the background is that there is a limit to small border traffic in neighbouring countries .
hake was required because of the toll criticism from the head of the CDU coalition .
the Left failed to have plans in the face of the dispute in the Union .
`` The Mur@@ k@@ s-@@ toll is dead , &apos;&apos; said the leader of Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger of the `` New Zealand newspaper &apos;&apos; -LRB- Monday -RRB- .
`` With the toll , the Minister `` Dob@@ rin@@ dt wants to introduce a vign@@ ette on all German roads that is supposed to start 2016 .
however , domestic car owners must not be burdened by the coalition contract .
that is why they are going to have a full compensation for the toll through the car tax .
however , the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers because of their nationality .
genetic disorder often wrongly diagnosed
a Bri@@ tin said that she thought as a result of a mis@@ diagnosis over many years that it would die .
Karin Rother lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she was only a few years ago when she was diagnosed with another illness .
she actually suffered from the Char@@ cot@@ -@@ Mar@@ ie@@ -T@@ oo@@ th disease -LRB- CM@@ T -RRB- .
Char@@ ity CM@@ T UK announced that mis@@ diagnosis is a frequent problem for people with CM@@ T .
about 23@@ 000 people in Britain are probably suffering from CM@@ T , which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness .
the disease is destructive and persistent , and the symptoms are worse than time .
when she was 13 , she believed that she would be able to survive with very poor survival prospects .
he thought that she would sit in the wheelchair before she would die 18 .
the mother of two children , who is 51 years old today , said : `` As a child I knew that I could not do the same as the others .
I fell constantly and everything took me longer .
I never had to go with the other children , and she was often going to go .
Amy said that in the age of 13 , after several operations , she looked at her feet , when her physician had left the room and read that she suffered in FA .
`` I felt guilty of me because I was curious , so I have told anyone , but I went to home , searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the F@@ A-@@ Society , &apos;&apos; `` she said .
when I wanted to reply , I was amazed and came into panic .
I thought that I would be with 18 in the wheelchair , and with 25 , all my abilities would lose .
I made everything to me with me and work on my own fruits .
when she was born 17 , she became aware that her abilities were not as strong as she presented and asked her physician .
he was easy , and told me , and I said , `` my love , I do not believe that you have that , otherwise you &apos;re already in the wheelchair .
I believe you have something far less of life .
after some genetic tests , the CM@@ T was detected .
`` When he said what CM@@ T was , I felt as if I was a winner .
Char@@ ity CM@@ T UK has launched a CM@@ T-@@ A@@ ware month to draw attention to this disease .
since the closure of the former military force , he worked since the closure of the former military force .
for about ten years , the former military place in Munich was no longer shot .
nevertheless , each month of to@@ d@@ ous ammunition is found in the heart of the bio@@ sphere .
the gran@@ ents are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be carried out on the ground .
in the heart of the bio@@ sphere area , there is a ste@@ ather in the middle of the course of the bio@@ sphere .
in December 2004 , the last sharp shot fell on the military site of Germany , closed after 110 years of military operations after 110 years .
since that time , the 6@@ 500 hectares have opened the core of the bio@@ sphere of Bis@@ anic Al@@ b , open to 13 , for hikers and cyclists .
the tax burden of businessmen in Washington is increasing with economic recovery .
a recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
the government in the country grew slightly in the country last year , and the economic recovery was accelerated , the newly published study took place last week , and the companies in the area of Washington did not form the exception .
companies in the area of District District , Germany , and Virginia paid $ 27.@@ 6 billion to government and local posts in the financial year 2013 , an increase in the rate of 3.8 % compared to the revenue of 26.@@ 6 billion .
last year , the state and local tax burden on companies rose to € 6@@ 71 billion , compared to 3.@@ 9 % in the year , while the third growth year was in consequence after the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010 .
state taxes rose more than the local charges , by 4.@@ 3 percent , in the study carried out by the service agency Ernst &amp; Young with the Centre for State taxation .
more than half the tax revenue of the District , 56 percent comes from corporate taxes , while 36 per cent of the revenue of the company originates from companies .
Virginia achieved the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 percent .
much of the increase in tax revenue is justified in a recovery of the properties of companies , telling the researchers what led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent in that year after the three consecutive years , with growth rates of less than 1 % .
while there was a large proportion of these gains from large states such as California , New York and Texas , the deal seems to be put in place for the area of Washington .
companies in the District , Germany , and Virginia spent more than $ 10 billion in government last year , compared to $ 9.@@ 6 billion - an increase in the course of a year of 4.2 percent .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in terms of the increase in government and local tax revenue , as real estate taxes amount to almost more than one fifth of the tax gap in companies .
companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of its national and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
`` In fact , the following is : a large part of the real estate , especially in the tax area around DC , is either in the possession of the government or by non-profit organizations that are not paying real estate taxes , &apos;&apos; said Douglas Lind@@ holm , Managing Director of the Center on State taxi .
it is therefore forced to rely on income taxes for instance to offer the same services that other states have .
the recent recovery on tax revenue by companies can not be guaranteed for the recovery of the real estate market
corporate revenue also seems to recover , that is the data .
companies in the region reported about income taxes at state organisations of $ 2.3 billion compared to $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
1 billion dollars in corporate income took the highest amount of the region .
while the trend is in the same direction , the local tax burden on companies is not increasing in all three places .
the exit rate in the district was equivalent to 4.@@ 3 % on the national average , while the rise was significantly higher than 4.@@ 9 % .
only Virginia reported an under@@ average tax rate of 4.@@ 1 percent .
with 6 percent in all three quarters , Virginia has the significantly lower corporate income tax -LRB- in all three , of course corporate tax rates -RRB- .
the corporate tax rate is at 8.@@ 25 % and in the district at relatively high 9.@@ 9@@ 75 percent .
a similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that , in Virginia , lower government taxes and local corporate taxes are required .
in the study , the district was not investigated .
despite the benefits , Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours .
North Carolina has decided to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.@@ 9 % to 6 % , the same sentence as Virginia , and by 5 % in the coming year .
if the state continues to achieve its income objectives next year , this law could reduce the corporate income rate from the country to 2017 by 3 % .
in the meantime , the small business seems to go better in Washington , and they pay more State and local taxes , so the recent study .
business taxes paid as personal income tax by small businessmen - a transition structure after which most of the small companies are organized - in the district , Germany , and Michigan last year by 20 % to $ 2.4 billion , with a significant faster growth rate than the corporate tax as a whole .
the researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country will probably continue to last this year , with an increase in the general added tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.@@ 2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 , compared with the same period of the previous year .
nevertheless , the area of Washington could lag behind when the government spending cuts affect the labour market in the region .
partner City : German beer in Germany
h@@ ams and Mal@@ z - also in China a popular combination .
German beer has an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt Partner City in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a flight direct connection between the two cities .
German beer , made in Frankfurt in Frankfurt - is the urgent wish of the Official in China .
`` We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle themselves in our town , &apos;&apos; said the deputy party secretary of the South Chinese metropolis , Li Taylor , during the visit of a SP@@ D delegation in his city this week .
the role of the ruling Communist Party in the course of the conversation came back to the concerns of the twel@@ f-@@ million metropolis .
Shanghai , known in Germany , is one of the richest cities in China .
that is why people too have the purchasing power to afford German beer .
he was born in Germany after a possible partner for the project .
`` For beer it does not need much : good water , cereals and joy , &apos;&apos; added to the party upper during lunch .
this joy of joy has already been put to the host by Mr Li .
as a result , the function of the company came to life with the same name as the wine that was served by the food .
the Chinese brand T@@ sing@@ vre is returning to German brewery art .
T@@ sing@@ ta@@ o-@@ beer will be cooked after the German purity .
more commerce
a second request from the Chinese host would be a flight direct link between Frankfurt and Germany .
the Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier , but in 2012 they were withdrawn from economic reasons .
`` It would be worthwhile , &apos;&apos; the local politicians proved to be convinced .
`` The business between our two cities continues to grow . &apos;&apos;
at the moment , passengers would have to take the replacement about Chang@@ sha in the province of Hun@@ an .
the administration of the province of Michigan , the capital of Germany , hopes for the flight connection .
the deputy governor of the province , Chen Yun@@ x@@ ian , focused on this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats .
`` This is a very good idea , &apos;&apos; replied the Chinese vice president , Li Jin@@ ju@@ n , an intimate expert in Germany .
partnership in France
he hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt in the next year .
he was already on the top , but it was not yet in this function .
he was only in office this year after his predecessor was transported out of office for corruption .
even the local party chef W@@ an Q@@ ing@@ lian had to go .
the action against government officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration , which is enforced by leader Xi Jin@@ ping .
the new Heads of State had worked for an American company in front of his party , which is most unusual in the Communist Party of China .
he worked as top class in Fuj@@ ian , Germany before taking office in Germany .
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen cities .
the connection to the 9000 km will belong to those who are being cared for by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year , the 25th anniversary of the German-@@ Chinese connection was celebrated .
the South Chinese metropolis in the Bible is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse .
in the next year , she wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros .
the family of Joan Hill `` hit the thumb &apos;&apos;
Joan Hill has been in the hands of a hospital in New York City for three days , but their daughter proved hopeful today that the 8@@ 1-@@ year-old com@@ ker recovered from her illness .
`` Thank you for your continued love and support , &apos;&apos; said Mel@@ issa rivers today in a communication .

the reactions came from many pages , even in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Tru@@ mp , Mon@@ tel Williams and Kelly Ri@@ pa .
environmentally friendly waste water and rising wages
in the future , more stringent environmental standards are applied in the future .

Amazon buys numbers for 1.@@ 04 billion
Amazon confirmed what information was reported on Monday morning .
the announcement is surprising , not because no one was expected to take hands , but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would buy the company .
three months ago , when the sale of T@@ lock took place in the video service of Google for a cool billion , and the cooperation appeared of course .
T@@ hang , founded three years ago as Ju@@ stin@@ .@@ tv , was started as a general cluster service - a live version of YouTube .
instead , it was quickly a platform for players who wanted to publish their Bra@@ vo@@ ur@@ pieces in games , a `` YouTube for live games &apos;&apos; .
the Twitter interface .
and `` let &apos; s play , &apos;&apos; a video genre , in which the better are playing , are very popular on YouTube .
it is precisely that YouTube is often called when you want to describe the message .
it is a mystery that the deal did not come with YouTube , because the company reports that it was ready to pay .
all that we know at the moment is the statement by Em@@ met Rö@@ ar , President of T@@ ash : `` We decided for Amazon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us to get faster than they do .
another secret , frankly , is the incredible success of T@@ Stop .
it &apos;s hard to understand the attraction that takes place in the game .
it is a matter of looking at a friend at 3 p.m. on the shoulder , while she can see him in the head .
all these games could just look at you .
another problem is that many of the most popular games are E@@ go games .
I admit that the quick steps in which the Roger banners complete all the games in record time are entertaining .
but as long as it is not a gambling or Hum@@ or@@ virtu@@ osis , his Twitter channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do I know what we know , as I have already said ?
T@@ GA is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet transportation .
and what exactly does Amazon want to make money ?
it &apos;s hard to imagine that T@@ Stop is so elegantly integrated in Amazon instant video .
but T@@ Track has something that each company would have liked : thousands of young men who are being used as advertising .
as the Chairman of T@@ hang , Sh@@ ar , said , Amazon and T@@ pe believe both in the future of the Gaming , &apos;&apos; and the medium does not show signs of being damaged .
there was a lot on the sunny night .
the concept of the organizer agreed .
in spite of the strong rain on the Saturday evening , about 1200 music fans came to go to the Open Air@@ -F@@ est in Burgundy .
in the meantime , the rest had to be stopped .
`` That was annoying , &apos;&apos; said Ron S@@ em , one of the organizers .
salt light and fun .
there are two Spanish words that have formed the name of Am@@ ula .
because the Open Air is going to shine on the day and on the evening by several shows .
Oh , and the fun comes anyway .
this was already on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors made to the Open Air .
a celebration for all generations had promised the organizers .
and that has been achieved .
there was also the possibility of being able to meet the needs of our guests .
you followed the first live performances , and you will enjoy cool drinks - relax and enjoy .
and that goes through the generations .
while one of them is on the beach bar , others will find themselves in a quarter of wine in the wine cellar , which was a great attraction for the smaller guests .
but even in the children &apos;s mouth , the volunteers had to do all the hands of all hands in the true sense of the word to become the captain and to create imaginative creations in the small faces .
the most advanced took part and took part in a lively workshop that was used by the Good@@ foot@@ crew .
to the great rain .
shortly before 5.30 p.m. pr@@ as@@ sel@@ te he turned to the visitors , especially with families looking for the long and dry ones .
but the attractiveness of the House did not do so .
`` There were more people than expected , &apos;&apos; said Ron S@@ em , who talked about the whole line .
that is why there is nothing contrary to a repeat of the great party in the coming year .
although the content and size of the event needs to be worked , S@@ em made it clear about the popular vote on Sunday .
when he said , he said that he had to be stopped .
obviously the security company was booked with too little power .
the result : some who had already paid did not come to the site .
the response was very good .
in a first cautious estimate , the sal@@ ted co-@@ organizing talked about about 1,200 visitors who were living in the castle garden .
there were problems with the sound technology .
he was born on the top of the road .
the technicians were unable to create a fairly reasonable sound .
the plans could not be created because the tents could not be brought to the sea because of a tyre cot .
`` In the next year , they will be in the event , as far as the organizers are concerned .
the premiere of the Am@@ ul@@ a-@@ Open Air@@ s was paid by the visitor .
and in bad weather .
however , the organizers have made a number of mistakes for the first time , while the second edition will have to be eliminated .
the organizers have to be criticised , even in the social network of Facebook .
`` sorry , but for 12 euros you have just expected , &apos;&apos; says Mel@@ anie Meier on the event page .
`` You unfortunately have taken over a little , &apos;&apos; says E@@ le Zimmermann at the same place .
others do not see the initial problems completely .
I think it is very good that some people try to put something on the legs .
stand out , &apos;&apos; writes Steph@@ anie Jen@@ ß to the Am@@ ula .
the organizers will now have a year of time to address this criticism .
new Rad@@ om in Berk@@ um : wax of the landmark .
it is not good enough to do so .
instead , the integrated part is waiting to be used in the distinctive building .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation radar will be renewed .
the new cycle will be slightly smaller than the old with a diameter of 4@@ 7.5 meters .
but the size is still world record .
the last step towards completing the new case
the upper part of the old shell is separated and taken with a crane .
then the last quarter of the new case will be created .
as far as the weather is concerned , the action will go over the stage this week .
participants in the I@@ hon@@ ed Challenge Challenge in the same way
Is@@ abelle Arnold from the United Kingdom , in fact , was cast over the head that she violated the bone structure of her face .
it was painful to have it .
a woman was delivered to the hospital after she had a lot of work in the I@@ hon@@ ed Challenge Challenge .
Is@@ abelle from Great Britain was as close to the head that she was responsible for her face structure .
`` The water was so cold that I found , and while I was actually , my valley simply stayed , &apos;&apos; she said to The mirror .
ice water is cut over the 20-@@ year-old .
Is@@ abelle Williams a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth , but that did not go , the jaw was left , and then I understood that something did not vote .
my mother and my sister saw that , and they disappeared almost in the pants , but had to go to the emergency .
the 20-@@ year-old from the UK was supplied to the hospital to restore the jaw after the participation in the viral trend on Tuesday .
the clip has been linked to a web site and a dozen on Facebook and Twitter .
are you able to meet the castle clubs again ?
finally , there was always an end between the two temples of Burgundy .
they are now thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the Wol@@ rison castle , the late Richard Dim@@ bath , a former chairman of the Wol@@ ek-@@ sh@@ aus@@ er castle , took the project in the French Gu@@ é@@ del@@ on project .
a year ago , there was no good climate between the castle and the castle of the castle .
in the past , the positions seemed to have been dealt with , as was done with the history of the Wol@@ rison Castle and possible reconstruction .
the two camps are now moving : discussions are going to be held soon .
this is what we have to say .
`` I called Mr Pi@@ ff@@ l , and I suggested that we could even sit up , &apos;&apos; Sj@@ ö@@ berg reported .
in his view , all members of both clubs would be able to move together in the future .
that is what happened faster than that .
during the castle , the castle is situated in the heart of the castle .
Herbert Pi@@ ff@@ l , head of the castle , was very pleased about the call .
he has been in the hands of the castle since the death of India .
a new President is going to be found in a member of the Council in mid-@@ September .
the association is currently about 40 members , according to the 7@@ 4-@@ year .
`` After the death of my friend Richard Dim@@ bath , we have been able to relax , &apos;&apos; said the term of thought , to consider how to go further .
according to Pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chair is going to go to the Chamber .
until then , the castle lovers could also make a current mood within their group .
there are still candidates for the Chair , Pi@@ ff@@ l says .
`` But I &apos;m confident that someone will find , &apos;&apos; he himself does not want to stand because he has his residence in Bad T@@ öl@@ z .
the new leader was supposed to be a colon@@ ist .
the T@@ öl@@ zer wanted to participate in the project .
the different positions in reconstruction will probably remain in the future .
he appreciates Dim@@ bath as the `` mission@@ ar , &apos;&apos; who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar projects in Austria and France would show that this idea does not have air .
due to the high level of participation of the population , and by volunteers from all over the world , they are a tourist magnet .
Pi@@ ff@@ l : ` I was also sceptical about the beginning .
but during the time I &apos;m more and more convinced that it makes sense to promote the project . &apos;&apos;
there is nothing wrong about that .
in addition , the project would be effective by EU subsidies , visitor tickets and potential sponsors .
`` The idea of reconstruction I personally do not want to throw away on board , &apos;&apos; he hope that the castle will move somewhat in this point .
their aim to document history is important and good .
then you could see .
clever ways of saving at Uni@@ -L@@ ehr@@ books
since the costs for Uni@@ -L@@ ehr@@ books for many students are more than 1,000 dollars per year , the F@@ ast-@@ 2 ts@@ em@@ ester@@ student Matt Schröder has a clever saving .
he found a temporary system for books of students of higher semester and offered nominal compensation to delay sales .
`` My mathematics book usually costs 180 $ , but I got it for 10 $ for a semester and a Ch@@ ick@@ -@@ A-@@ K@@ ek , &apos;&apos; said Schröder , 19 , who visits the office of Georgia in Georgia .
the books needed for the last semester would have cost him 430 , he said .
there were 120 $ .
as a result of this , students have issued more than 1,200 copies for teaching books and study material , however , that there are different costs for students .
online events and creative approaches are increasingly the solution to students .
the rental of courses becomes popular , and students can use a book for a semester for a while , often at a much cheaper price .
Ne@@ dera Inc , which operates more than 250 university book@@ shops , announced that the rent of text books has been doubled since 2011 .
polls in the industry show that about one quarter of books was rented in the Col@@ le@@ ge-@@ book@@ shops in the past spring .
less than half of the teaching books will be bought by the National Association National Association of College Store .
here is the unique one for the best deals .
buy online
some new books cost online only one third of the price .
the ninth edition of `` the world of art in the world and the largest in the world in the world , and all in the world in the world -RRB- in the United States , and the world of the world in the world in the world of the world
needed
if one of the notes does not make anything , used books are a good option .
for 9@@ 3.@@ 49 is needed on Ch@@ eg@@ g@@ .com .
Matt Cas@@ a@@ day , 25 , final student at the Bri@@ ham Young University , says that he spent 42 c@@ ents on Amazon 42 c@@ ents for a used edition of `` Strategic Media Dec@@ ision :
the book was sold new for 48 .
academics such as Sven Bra@@ c@@ ey , Head of the University of Massachusetts recommended students to ask their professors to ask if earlier spending was permitted .
sometimes updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the costs for the latest edition .
there is also a popular alternative for used books , except Ch@@ egg and Amazon .
renting
the rent of teaching books is worth considering if you treat them well , thinking that they do not want to return and complete the books after the course .
you can save more than 80 percent from the cost of a new purchased book .
for example , a student could rent for the duration of a semester for about $ 20 .
please inform yourself about the terms and conditions of your business .
if you do not return the book , the penalties may exceed the price of a new book .
E-@@ Books
e-@@ books instead of conventional teaching books are an option .
sometimes these books are de facto rented by means of an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon .com , Ch@@ egg and Bar@@ nes &amp; Nob@@ le Inc. .
in Ch@@ egg , you can rent the `` to rent &apos;&apos; for 6 months for about 61 dollars .
Bra@@ c@@ ey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals , because many classics can be downloaded for free .
look at them in any case .
Joe Gault , 29 who will soon visit the Pep@@ per@@ dine Law School recommend the IS@@ B@@ N number for the price of books because you can be sure to find the right course book .
and before an online order you should check if the book is actually in stock .
he learned this lesson on the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks and paid the full price in the gallery book .
why the `` War@@ ans of the Galaxy &apos;&apos; did not become a ticket .
`` The Exp@@ end@@ ables 3 &apos;&apos; by Sy@@ lv@@ ester Water@@ one played less than $ 30 million in the US in the US , during `` S@@ in City : a Lady to Kil@@ l &apos;&apos; For `` only $ 12 million of its budget of $ 70 million .
the film `` sex Tap@@ e &apos;&apos; on Cameron Di@@ az played only 14.@@ 6 million dollars on the opening weekend , while children &apos;s films are easily disappointed by the revenue .
one of the authors of the comic film critic Rob@@ bie Coll@@ in suggests that in the children the lack of quality could be the reason for the films .
in 2014 , Coll@@ in described `` the worst year &apos;&apos; for child films .
however , in films for a slightly older target group , it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
in July , Entertainment Weekly showed the average of the Silver Film Show and Met@@ ac@@ ri@@ tic evaluation for each summer film start , which was shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th July 2013 .
the results are based on the views of cinema visitors and film critics .
some commentators have said that the development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web cluster services such as Net@@ dri@@ x .
director Tim F@@ av@@ re@@ au , who is now working on dis@@ positions soon , said about the website Hollywood : `` I believe the times will change .
we have to accept that and not try to carry out the past .
in contrast to the currently weak cash sequences of the Hollywood productions , Net@@ dri@@ x has recently spent sales with the output content of $ 1.2 billion , almost twice as last year , in the turnover of 8@@ 37 million dollars .
in the last summer , the director Steven Play@@ berg criticised the film studios for focusing themselves too on the film of comics and being `` the core of Hollywood .
in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his bleak prophecy could well contain a true core .
however , in the summer of 2015 , there are other representatives of the film industry that are optimistic :
the producer of X-@@ Men , Simon Kin@@ berg , described the decline of the cash results recently as simply `` cyclical &apos;&apos; and said to Hollywood : `` The next summer will be the biggest summer in the cinema .
when a few years ago the 2 tennis district class was eliminated , that was a step in the right direction .
now , the German tennis court has taken up another 3rd party program .
the result is that those who have not risen have risen .
in the coming season , however , in the coming season there are still five hundred per cent in the next season .
the fourth class is left in the regional league in spite of its immense history .
the boys and girls of Tor@@ tr@@ o start in the Dutch league , as well as the boys of the SC We@@ ende .
the exhibitors and the gates of the city will be represented in the new association league , in the national league .
at the women , the T@@ TV Gei@@ sm@@ ar plays in the municipal league .

in the district league , Tor@@ tr@@ o III and S@@ atten@@ hausen @/@ W@@ ö@@ ll are running .
depending on nine teams
the SC We@@ ende sends his girls to the small district league .
also the municipal season of the SC@@ W-@@ boys - there is still Tor@@ sp@@ o II - is not complete .
in a district class go to Gei@@ sm@@ ar , Tus@@ po We@@ ende and Bo@@ ppy SV in the season .
in the first season of the newly founded Regional Association , the two di@@ inger districts start with nine teams .
in the west season are the Red White II , Bo@@ ppy SV III , Lau@@ bach II , Tor@@ tr@@ o IV , and V , MTV Gr@@ one , M@@ iel@@ en@@ hausen , and SG L@@ eng@@ ern II .

this is still better than in the circle of Easter .
what is striking is that no one of the six levels of circle can be achieved .
NATO Summit : first protests in Newport and Cardiff
the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit .
on Saturday , hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered to an anti-@@ NATO march .
on Sunday about 150 people in Cardiff came together in Cardiff before the city hall in order to hold a so-called counter-@@ summit .
Stephen Fair@@ cl@@ ough followed the developments in the weekend for us and talked about demonstrators who went to Belgium .
teenagers from the Blue Mountains
two girls were brought to safety with the cable wind after they were caught in the Blue Mountains in N@@ SW .
the 16-@@ year-old girl and the 19-@@ year-old man broke out after Sunday afternoon in G@@ ov@@ ett Le@@ ap in Black@@ he@@ ath .
concerned relatives called for about 20 p.m. the police when the two had not returned home .
a search guide from local police and rescue services was found on and the pair at about 23 p.m. .
the girl was in the knees and the man was over@@ thrown and had beaten his head .
rescue forces stayed at night in the couple , and they went on Monday tomorrow .
they were supplied in stability with a health car in the Blue Mountains Hospital .
escalating government protests in Pakistan
the about 1000 demonstrators have been pushed out of the P@@ TV building by soldiers from the P@@ TV building .
after half an hour , the transmitter was captured .
P@@ TV director Ath@@ ar Far@@ oo@@ q said that the demonstrators would have damaged equipment in the editorial .
deaths or injuries have not been reported .
the demonstrators call for the resignation of the Heads of Government to accuse them of electoral fraud .
the police issued about one kilometre from the Prime Minister Na@@ wa@@ z Shar@@ if on Monday to meet about 3000 demonstrators with security forces .
after hospital information , a policeman has been injured .
in the weekend , at least three people were killed and more than injured as demonstrators tried to resign to Sh@@ ari@@ fs Residence .
they call for the President &apos;s resignation .
on Sunday evening , the mighty military called for a political solution to the conflict after a meeting in the army headquarters , without wasting time and using violence . &apos;&apos;
furthermore , the communication states that the army is committed to ensuring the security of the state . &apos;&apos;
the escalation of violence has borne cause for concern for the military that has already been more popular in the past .
the protests made by the opposition politician Im@@ ran Khan took place on 14 August on 14 August .
Shar@@ if refuses to resign .
Khan and Qaddafi had called their followers on the Sunday to be bold .
`` We will not decline if Shar@@ if has been forced to resign , &apos;&apos; said Khan .
Mr Chirac spoke in the same direction .
Khan discards Shar@@ if that the parliamentary election in May won last year by fraud .
Mr Chirac is asking for the resignation of Central and the provincial governments .
it is then intended to reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are being used to protect the government .
first of all , the demonstrators held themselves in peace before the European Parliament , to Sh@@ ari@@ fs Residence on the weekend .
H@@ til@@ dorf started on the top of the table after a two-@@ season victory .
with the 2 : 0 about Val Gardena , a bitter week on Sunday , a bitter end on Sunday .
`` The victory is very liberated , &apos;&apos; said trainer Z@@ oran Bar@@ is@@ ic , whose team reached an interim executive in the Europa League on Thursday .
`` It was very important to success , &apos;&apos; confirmed captain and Tor@@ guard of Steff@@ en Hof@@ mann , who met with green white on space .
with the second season victory , Sch@@ ram@@ mel@@ -@@ Dream has shown the right response to the disappointment of Helsinki and will meet with success in the country games .
`` We wanted to show a positive reaction , &apos;&apos; said external defender Thomas Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el , who took the course on victory .
`` I thought I thought I got the whole from Thursday purely , and I put him under the bar , &apos;&apos; said the 26th year-old .
as Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el on 13 November 2010 , which took place last time in a federal state , was still for Ri@@ ed .
it will therefore keep him in special memory .
`` For me this is something very special , I &apos;m out of the rap@@ id , &apos;&apos; said Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el .
as a result of the age of time by Mario Pa@@ vel@@ ic , Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el stood from the left on the right and made his cause very well .
he has a lot of experience that he can also exercise this position .
the gate has earned himself that he has already done some Ass@@ ists , &apos;&apos; praised Bar@@ is@@ ic .
the team will be able to give you the opportunity to meet your needs .
the guests could also have been able to write them .
`` God is thanks to today , ` God said , &apos;&apos; Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el , who played on the gap of performance and results in recent weeks : `` The results have not voted , but the game was always well compared to the last year . &apos;&apos;
Bar@@ is@@ ic even found that in many games there was better than today - against `` the strongest team that played in this season . &apos;&apos;
the first three-@@ point since 26 July has therefore shown that the team structure was intact : `` Today my team has shown that it has character . &apos;&apos;
for him : `` That we have finally played to zero .
a lot of work has been done during the days of the country by the fact that , with Brian B@@ asser , Mario Pa@@ vel@@ ic , Christopher Di@@ bon , Den@@ i Al@@ ar and Michael Sch@@ imp@@ els@@ berger , several failures have been heard .
`` It is not possible to forget this , &apos;&apos; said Bar@@ is@@ ic , who in the past three days has lost with B@@ eger and Pa@@ vel@@ ic players , `` which was very stable in recent times .
therefore , the country playing time needs to be used to `` wounds to l@@ edges and in the physical field , &apos;&apos; declared Bar@@ is@@ ic , who has five of them in his ranks .
one of them is located in the heart of the city .
he finds himself for the team , goes to pain .
especially in this difficult phase , he has shown that he is a very important player for us .
Hof@@ mann was not only the structure but also the second gateway .
it was the first hit of the game since 2 November 2013 -LRB- 4 : 2 -RRB- .
Hof@@ mann is : `` It is not true that everything is good , &apos;&apos; `` We have certainly had a bit of luck , but at some time the happiness needs to come back to us .
now it was high time , &apos;&apos; Hof@@ mann said .
but he said that he was too busy to work : ` It must not always look black and white .
in the last few weeks , we have not played as poorly as it has been .
but we must not believe that everything is good .
he could not dispute the importance of his role for the team .
it is a very young team , which I can help at the moment .
that is true in certain phases , but that is what Hof@@ mann said .
the company had a lot to blame for .
he regrets the quick contrast from the category of Magic , as well as to the regular gateway of N@@ utz in the 40 minute .
the only accusation I can do to the team is that we have not been specific enough to Tor in a few stages .
there have been too little qualifications .
similarly , we have found ourselves in the same way : `` It has started quite badly , while we have even found a gateway .
in general , more would have been .
there is a number of people in the world .

after weeks , Italy &apos;s Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the Council , against strong conservative resistance to the EU@@ Special Summit last week , gave rise to the nomination of his Minister of Foreign Affairs as head of the EU &apos;s foreign policy .
Ren@@ zi looks at how to show the government of English , the appeal of his own fashion team as a favorite fashion artist in the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU .
it also expects a boost to the `` reform package &apos;&apos; in Italy .
last but not least , Ren@@ zi hopes to make the left party base quiet .
in view of the conservative representatives of President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the President of the Council , the predominant view will be made in Rome .
the chief diplomacy of the EU , at the same time , will be the deputy of the President of the Commission .
the approval of the European Parliament is sure to be safe .
otherwise , President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly announce the nomination of the 4@@ 1@@ year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party -LRB- PD -RRB- to the role of Italy in the EU .
he is aware of the fact that the `` enormous challenges &apos;&apos; have grown since almost two decades in leading party offices .
the native Roman Empire is married and has two daughters .
in 1996 , her party career began in the youth organization of the former Social Democrats of the Nazi Republic of Sweden .
in 1999 , Mo@@ win@@ ini was founded for three years Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Independent Youth -LRB- European Jung@@ Democrat -RRB- .
with the election in 2001 in the party council of the left-wing Democrats , she grew up in the high party politics , worked in the Department of Foreign Affairs , and soon became their director .
you have known traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East , with studies on the NATO commitment in Afghanistan , with the involvement of the Russian Social Democrats in Europe and the United States .
since 2008 she is a member of the Chamber of Representatives .
when Ren@@ zi was born in February 2014 , he was appointed to his Minister of State .
if the PD once again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country that contributed to the 40 % votes of the Party during the elections in May , then , as has been noted in P@@ D-@@ circles , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ vin@@ ini has a share in this .
there is little diplomatic experience in Brussels in Brussels , and that is what is happening in the PD .
in Brussels , especially by Poland and by the Baltic members , realistic research into the crisis in Ukraine is being carried out in Ukraine .
she is in favour of South Stream pipeline by the Russian company , South Stream , to be transported directly to southern Europe by Ukraine , which also serves the energy security of Italy .
after Ren@@ zi took office as an EU president in July , Mo@@ vin@@ ini went to Moscow for its first class visit to Moscow .
photos that showed them with Putin were admitted in Brussels , just as they invited the Kremlin leader for a Milan economic summit for October .
a total of nine young people started on Monday their education at em@@ z-@@ Han@@ auer .

Putin is calling for Kiev to include the `` State Dialogue &apos;&apos; with the O@@ stu@@ kra@@ ine .
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media reports on Sunday , on Sunday , that the Ukrainian Government will take the fighting against the separ@@ ati@@ sts in the east of the country .
his spokesman made it clear that Putin did not mean that this would be part of Russia under the control of the separ@@ ati@@ sts , but his status needs to be re@@ defined to Ukraine in order to give power to the Russian speaking region to represent its rights and interests .
however , Putin &apos;s appeal to negotiations with the pro-@@ Russian insurgents , however as it seems to be followed by him since five months , the strategy for the separ@@ ati@@ sts in areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the new region of No@@ vor@@ o@@ ssi@@ ja real independence for a alliance with Russia , as well as the West .
in an interview with the State Television channel , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for withdrawing the areas of separ@@ ati@@ sts in the Eastern regions of Don@@ ez@@ k and Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k , in March and April , following Moscow the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March .
in recent times , the Kremlin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have been referred to as the `` No@@ vor@@ o@@ ssi@@ ja , &apos;&apos; or `` Neur@@ uss@@ land , &apos;&apos; a concept that reminds us about the early revolutionary times of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those who have died in the election campaign for the elections for the elections , while civilian communities attacked in their illusions , said `` in their illusions . &apos;&apos;
`` We have to start detailed discussions , not just technical questions , but also the political organisation of society and the state status of the South Caucasus in order to preserve the interests of the people living there .
Pes@@ kov said that Putin &apos;s reference to the state needs to be seen in the context of greater autonomy , which has been discussed since months by Kiev to reassure fears in Russian speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk .
only the Ukrainian government can give the Eastern territories the necessary autonomy , said Pes@@ kov .
it is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but about an internal conflict in Ukraine .
the clarification of the Kremlin , in contrast to Putin &apos;s remarks , stressed the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , in contrast to the immediate action of Crimea , with the majority of the 2 million inhabitants of ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulties , the regions of Don@@ ez@@ k and Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k , because the majority of millions of inhabitants are not Russians and showed a broad majority in Ukraine from the conflict .
the autonomy that was raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments authority in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations , while the Kremlin is de facto to control an area that combines Russian territory with Crimea .
the peninsula in the Black Sea is located in the Black Sea for the majority of Russian Marine and an important commercial port and historical coastal region .
the regions between the RoHS region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines , factories and plants that produce important components for the Russian military .
in his speech , the Ukrainian President Pet@@ ro Por@@ o@@ bor proposed on 7 June that Ukrainian legislation should take account of the Constitution , which would give rise to greater control over their finances and the status of languages .
but his vision of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to the Kremlin and the separatist rebels , which is being accused of Moscow .
Putin &apos;s last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders in the past week last week , following Russian troops and tanks over the previously peaceful region in the O@@ stu@@ kra@@ ine region .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts supported by Russia , according to fears of Ukrainian security officers , have been the first step of a campaign for the acquisition of the strategic coastal region to Crimea .
this is why massive civil and military preparations are being carried out to help Mari@@ u@@ pol , a steel forestry port with 500,000 inhabitants located between No@@ vo@@ as@@ ow@@ sk and the narrow access to the Crimea Peninsula .
Por@@ o@@ bor spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
`` We are just before a point on which there is no more back .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
the EU summit decided not to carry out concrete action , calling for further sanctions against Russia , which should enter into force in an un@@ specified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in I@@ lo@@ wa@@ j@@ sk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers last week to support the occupied separ@@ ati@@ sts , said Colonel Andri@@ j Ly@@ sen@@ ko , spokesman of Ukraine &apos;s National Security and Defence Council on Saturday in Kiev .
the first was probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers in I@@ lo@@ wa@@ j@@ sk who have been arrested on Sunday against 10 Russian cases that were caught a week ago on Ukrainian territory .
n@@ ativity about Australian Pro@@ ques and Gab@@ i Gre@@ ck@@ o
Ge@@ off@@ rey did not make a H@@ ehl about his anger about hackers , who have probably been stolen by his Ver@@ lob@@ ten Gab@@ i Gre@@ ck@@ o and a one who will have stolen the A-@@ Pro@@ re from Hollywood .

on the list are 101 Pro@@ mis .
the most recent month with Gre@@ ck@@ o said : ` It &apos;s wrong .
all private letters and images should remain private .
it is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and passed on to others .
Gre@@ ck@@ o , at the time in New York , said , according to reports , that the H@@ ack was shameful and the people affected felt `` hurt . &apos;&apos;
the hackers have probably 30 images of Pal@@ mer with their ex-@@ friend Scott Speed@@ man , including two pictures in which they are above without a swimming pool .
they belong to the film of Pal@@ mers `` love is un@@ defeated &apos;&apos; with Li@@ am Hem@@ s@@ worth .

Rad@@ ler , jogging and hikers took place yesterday at the 8th wheel on the Great Feld@@ berg and supported the `` Help for Cre@@ ating Children . &apos;&apos;
the tour , which was one of them , was easy for the others .
in one , all of us agree that there has been fun .
Thomas Stu@@ dan@@ ski was able to sleep well in the night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the Ober@@ ur@@ sel@@ er brewery took place yesterday with the wheel on the Feld@@ berg .
for the good purpose .
he can easily rely on the little muscle , given that he has brought valuable knowledge to him on 8 wheels at the Great Feld@@ berg in favour of the association .
a great thing .
`` I know now that I can say that !
small p@@ ases in the applause curve ?
snow , if I had once stopped , have been out of love .
like Thomas Stu@@ dan@@ ski , who is sitting for the CDU in Ober@@ ur@@ sel@@ er , many of the 7@@ 18 participants came to mountains yesterday in the early night and came to the plateau .
on the other hand , it was easier to overcome the well eleven kilometres long between Hoh@@ emark and Feld@@ berg .
Norman for example , for example .
the most important thing in the world is : `` There &apos;s a lot of professionals .
he also went through the track in a slide , as was also Nina Kuhn , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in in the town of Ober@@ ur@@ sel .
for the two tri@@ ils the `` field mines &apos;&apos; was not necessarily a sports challenge : `` This is about Char@@ ity , so we would like to take the exit - we would have taken the exit today .
on the way , they met Paul Wenceslas of Ober@@ rei@@ fen@@ berg .
the boy -LRB- 12 -RRB- went to Ober@@ ur@@ sel in the morning to jump to the height .
in the morning , the Frankfurter Florian decor@@ z took part in the saddle , `` made `` the Feld@@ berg &apos;&apos; two times to roll with fun .
fun had also `` Fr@@ itt@@ en-@@ Toni . &apos;&apos;
for the head of the Ober@@ ur@@ sel@@ er cult zoo , bike bike tours are easy to find .
he had 40 minutes with his 6.@@ 5-@@ kilo wheel .
a crazy event .
for this purpose , since I &apos;m happy to say , &apos;&apos; Andreas blessed .
the Main@@ zer tells himself that he is a `` ambitious race for racing . &apos;&apos;
that is what it needs to be , because it was with the `` fix &apos;&apos; that they are also racing bikes .
the fact that it went to the top without wheel does not just show the 20 hikers who grew up over the White Wall and on the top to the summit .
he was born in Berlin in the middle of the 19th century .
the 7@@ 18 participants have been sent to the route in several years .
the hikers are first at weekends at the end of the day .
the first cyclists and runners followed at 10 p.m
five minutes later , the first mountain bike took place .
there was also a lot of people who wanted to have the opportunity to meet .
for the next year he hopes that it will be possible to block the route to Feld@@ berg on the security of participants .
