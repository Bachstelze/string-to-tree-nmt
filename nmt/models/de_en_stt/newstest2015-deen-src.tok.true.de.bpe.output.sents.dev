return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
the Congres@@ smen Keith Ell@@ ison and John Lewis have proposed a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of unions as citizen rights .
`` As unions die , middle-class jobs are dying , &apos;&apos; said Ell@@ ison , a democrat from Minnesota and Deputy Chairman of Progressive C@@ auc@@ us in Congress .
that is why I am proud to present the employee authorisation law with the civil rights representative of John Lewis .
this ground-@@ breaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities of discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions such as other forms of discrimination - and stops such anti-@@ union forces .
the addition of the national law on labour law , in order to create a possibility of discrimination for discrimination against the organisation of a union representation , in order to sue in front of a civil court for justice - and to get compensation for damages or criminal charges - is a useful and necessary initiative .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - in any case , it is not in accordance with American standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what Ell@@ ison , Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is the link back to a very American idea .
in spite of the setbacks that trade unions have been facing over the past few years , in Wisconsin , Michigan , and other countries around the country , Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognise , extend and respect labour rights .
there was a time when millions of Americans remember this country &apos;s democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath .
when the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militar@@ ised auto@@ cracy Hed@@ ki To@@ jos was replaced by democracy .
in full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions in the creation of a new Japan have a role in the creation of a new Japan , the workers and their unions used a language that is explicitly recognised that `` the rights of workers in association and joint negotiations and actions are guaranteed . &apos;&apos;
when the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War , General D@@ wi@@ ght David Eisen@@ ho@@ wer and his staff sent the Germans to write a constitution that would replace Nazi Hitler with a strong democracy .
in recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves , and their voice should rise in the new nation , the Germans added a clause that said explicitly : ` The right to set up associations in order to safeguard and improve labour and economic conditions , and a guarantee for each individual and every profession .
agreements that limit this right or aim to diminish it are null and void ; measures that are intended are illegal .
when former First Lady Ele@@ an@@ or Roosevelt held the presidency on the International Commission on Human Rights , from which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted , as it was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the other authors provided a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to form or to join unions to protect his interests . &apos;&apos;
since generations , Americans have accepted the basic premise of human rights in human rights .
when this country joined other countries when it was possible to shape civil and democratic societies , Americans said that the right to the establishment of a trade union was to be protected , and that it would have to be protected by collective negotiations as an equal partner with companies and government agencies .
since these rights in America are under attack , it is indeed a matter of repeating the American ideal , which is that working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society .
as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement has not limited the power of the nation , but has enlarged it .
by raising the standard of living of millions of people , work has created a market for industry and has raised the entire nation at unimaginable levels of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but history preserves them .
history reminds us , and we should do so .
the formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens &apos; rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
Keith Ell@@ ison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that America has made in the past and that the promise of democracy has been resolved .
judge stops on a temporary basis that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force closure to close
on Sunday , a US judge stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana , of which lawyers said that it would probably have led to the closure of all the five re@@ mediation clinics in the state .
this measure , which was imposed by Bobby Jin@@ dal , Governor of Louisiana , in June to enter into force and to enter into force on 1 September , would force doctors who carry out abortion to acquire a hospital &apos;s right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice .
however , the decision of the judge means that doctors can , for the time being , be able to carry out legal abortions , while they are applying for such rights .
`` The plain@@ ti@@ ffs can continue to work in accordance with the laws of law while they are striving to achieve these rights , &apos;&apos; Bundes@@ judge John de@@ grav@@ elles wrote in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing for the judge will be held in order to make a more permanent decision in favour of the law .
abortion supporters welcomed the decision made in a series of judgments against similar measures , saying that doctors decided to gain more time to obtain hospital registration rights .
`` Today &apos;s decision means that women in Louisiana will escape from a misguided law that they want their health and rights to take their health and rights , ` said Nancy North@@ up , President and chairman of the centre of reproductive rights , which , on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state , had taken charge of the law to stop the law .
it was not immediately obvious whether the judgment also extended to doctors from the two clinics who did not support the complaint and had also asked for the right of transfer .
Louisiana is one of 11 states which has issued similar laws , in which courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi in the absence of a constitutional treaty .
key points of a law in Texas , which had forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close , were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
abortion supporters and the American College of O@@ stre@@ tri@@ cians and Gy@@ nec@@ ologists , as well as the American Medical Association , and the American Medical Association agree that doctors &apos; right of permission requires unnecessary restrictions .
anti-@@ abortion activists believe that the measures serve to protect women &apos;s health , even though some of them welcomed the effects of closure of clinics .
only a doctor who performs abortion in Louisiana has patient confidence , has shared the center of reproductive rights .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to do no more of them , that doctor would not do the operation in fear of his safety , said the group .
in their argument against the judgment , representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the execution of abortion , while their requests for assistance to patients &apos; rights would be pending .
delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best ways of treatment lead to higher death rates caused by o@@ vari@@ an cancer in rural areas .
Angel@@ ina Jo@@ lie and her brother James have sent a video to her mother , who died in 2007 on o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
for women in rural areas of Australia , there is a higher risk of dying of o@@ vari@@ an cancer than women in cities .
researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women who discovered o@@ vari@@ an cancer in 2005 and discovered that only 25 percent of them were still alive five years after diagnosis .
the research leader Susan Jordan of Q@@ IM@@ R Bergh@@ ofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas .
small STU@@ DIE : new medicines could slow down lung and o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years of age .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis , type of o@@ vari@@ an cancer , existing conditions of reference and social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer had already progressed at the risk of diagnosis , the rate of survival was the lowest .
for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas .
although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with a higher risk of cancer of eggs , Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors .
`` This disease is treated best by gy@@ nec@@ ological onc@@ ologists , and these are mostly found in larger cities , `` said it .
in spite of the improvement of telem@@ edic@@ ine services , in order to counter the distances of the distances , they proposed as possible remedies of the service of frozen doctors to give specialists the possibility of providing women to their place of residence , as well as to treatment programs for people outside their region .
Dr. Jordan said that the study , independent of geographical status , showed a poor long-term growth rate among women in o@@ vari@@ an cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and preventive strategies .
the study funded by Rio T@@ into to Con@@ quer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
in March 2013 , El@@ isha Ne@@ ave , a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast , had had an aggressive form of o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
garden centres are sorry to hear a drop in ownership of domestic ownership .
the decline in combination with an increase in the number of home@@ owners under the age of 35 may cause gardens to lose tens of thousands of pounds per year if today &apos;s young consumers after a study of HT@@ A , as reported in the Financial Times , reach the `` core age group for hor@@ ticultural products . &apos;&apos;
the report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount people spend on their own garden .
the rise of people who live in highly urban@@ ized areas without gardens , the popular procedure , pre-@@ gardens for parking purposes , and the fall in garden size are other factors that threaten the industry , in which £ 5 billion in sale is estimated .
in the wider London area , where the share of home@@ owners has fallen from 61 to 43 % over a period of six years , the least expenditure on garden products per household will be reported .
the HT@@ A and the Royal Hor@@ ticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people are not able to draw plants .
Guy Bar@@ ter , head chef for R@@ HS , said that `` container farms are very popular with tenants , for example , because they can bring their plants with them in a move . &apos;&apos;
the HT@@ A report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the `` golden age &apos;&apos; of hor@@ ticulture as a result of rising house ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980 to the mid-@@ 1990 &apos;&apos; s .
he also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather after un@@ friendly weather conditions in March and April of last year .
the protest movement in Pakistan , led by the opposition politician Im@@ ran Khan and the Spir@@ it@@ ual Tah@@ ir@@ ul Qaddafi , continues in Pakistan .
in the capital of Islamabad , around 1000 demonstrators have te@@ amed up with state television station P@@ TV .
Minister of Education , Per@@ v@@ ai@@ z Ras@@ hid , said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from P@@ TV building .
the transmitter launched its operation for around 40 minutes , but it has been sent back again .
at the same time , around 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Na@@ wa@@ z Shar@@ if .
around a kilometre of them , they came together with sticks and stones equipped with security forces .
the police set up t@@ ren@@ eng@@ as .
the demonstrators called for Sh@@ ari@@ fs &apos; resignation , but it rejected it .
meanwhile , the country &apos;s army is calling for a political solution to the conflict , without wasting time and without using violence . &apos;&apos;
after a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening , the military said that `` the army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state . &apos;&apos;
the military has an important role in Pakistan , and it has had a more frequent use of it .
opposition politician Im@@ ran Khan repro@@ aches Premier Shar@@ if , when parliamentary elections were deceived in May last year .
the protests were escalating at the weekend , after Khan and Qaddafi called upon their followers to invade Sh@@ ari@@ fs residence .

Turkey appointed US diplomat in terms of espionage reports
the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has signed a report on American and British espionage in Turkey in a report about American and British espionage .
Deputy Prime Minister B@@ ül@@ ent said that the business leaders of the US Embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday .
the German magazine The mirror , as well as the online magazine The Inter@@ c@@ ept , reported that Turkey &apos;s main activity area for the US and British intelligence agencies was Turkey &apos;s main activity area for the US analysts of the National Security Agency , Edward Snow@@ den .
according to Turkish news agencies , Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yip Erdogan dealt with the importance of the report and said that all of the key countries had spi@@ ed out each other .

indic@@ ted by Mag@@ alu@@ f of Cor@@ ruption
on Friday , the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Cal@@ vi@@ à at the office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca .
the head of the police of Cal@@ vi@@ à on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested on charges of corruption of businessmen and bar@@ owners in the notorious Bin@@ ge-@@ for-@@ the-@@ water hotspot of Mag@@ alu@@ f .
after allegations of corruption against him against him from several businessmen from Punta Ball@@ ena , the street in which most of the bars and nightclubs of Mag@@ alu@@ f are located , he has been detained in custody .
according to information from the online newspaper Mallorca Di@@ ario , the prosecutor presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Cal@@ vi@@ à to the prosecutor &apos;s office on the fight against corruption on Friday .
two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are consulted jointly with Navar@@ ro by a judge .
the national Spanish newspaper ABC reported that the angry night watch@@ holder said that the authorities &apos;&apos; nepo@@ tism has a serious impact on her business .
`` It is not more money to make money , it is about survival , &apos;&apos; one of the business people said in the court .
let our lives of life come from the game .
we have nothing to lose .
in this summer , Mag@@ alu@@ f made international headlines as a result of a viral You@@ Tu@@ be-@@ videos , in which an 18-@@ year-old British tourist who performed at 24 men during a tour of Fell@@ atio took place .
since then , the island authorities have tried to put a stop to the illegal behaviour of alcohol@@ -free holidaymakers in Mag@@ alu@@ f by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol@@ -free pub .
the Play@@ house Club , where Fell@@ ati took place , had to pay for a year to close down , while Play@@ house and the restaurant Car@@ n@@ age will have to pay a penalty of 5@@ 5.000 € -LRB- $ 7@@ 3.000 -RRB- together .
the tourist town of Mag@@ alu@@ f , which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers , is also known for a number of accidents involving alcohol , including the `` Bal@@ con@@ ing &apos;&apos; trend in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony in the hotel pool .
the first spring day with wet and stor@@ my weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport .
spring has had a winter surprise with intense spectac@@ les and strong winds , and flights from Adelaide airport were impaired .
in the evening up to 21 hours , there had been a further temperature on the city , 6,@@ 6@@ mm , which had already gone down in the night to Sunday .
the last rainfall was the result of a series of short , stor@@ eyed shr@@ ubs , including a crowd that started shortly before 20 , and which provided around 10 minutes for almost 4@@ mm .
after the winter last week had an early dose of spring , the temperature in the city on Monday fell to a maximum of only 15.@@ 8 ° .
the bad weather conditions are likely to lead to the late arrival of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide .
the plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 , but it has been hit by a blow - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and it had to run through .
at that point , wind moves reached around 50 km @/@ h on the ground at Adelaide Airport .
the flight data showed that the plane had to pass through on a second landing flight and eventually got up at around 20.@@ 40 .
the delay in flight delays led to delays in some other flights , including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qu@@ ant@@ as-@@ flights from Sydney .
for Adelaide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday , with possible shows .
Matth@@ ies means : is it high time to set big signs
in view of the technical advances that are threatening to turn our cosy home into high-tech switches , our colum@@ n@@ ist Bernd Matth@@ ies has a familiar electronic accessory .
while I am writing this here , my view on the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone , and I think , Bo@@ ah , like retro , is this ?
but there is a point of thinking behind it : if the cable would not be , all listeners would fly in the house in the shortest possible time , and that would be considerably more than that .
in any case , the ek@@ el@@ tron@@ ic -LRB- ek@@ el@@ tron@@ ic -RRB- is valid .
no , ty@@ pos : electronic -RRB- sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow , which has been bought .
and those who , for example , today still have a tube TV in the living room , said only that he rejects television in principle .
why these considerations ?
because the pressure of the I@@ fa on the radio tower this week brings our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics .
the La@@ ie , who once dominated washing machines and CD players , now does not even understand the purpose of the equipment that will be spread against him with incomprehensible expert spre@@ e in front of him : `` Connec@@ ted Home , W@@ ear@@ ables , Health Care and Urban Technologies are promising us the press office .
yes , that is something we do .
what is to talk to people who seem to be able to spread them voluntarily ?
in fact , for around 20 years , it has been a matter of linking our House .
this is why the yo@@ ghurt itself is used to tell us that the fire on holidays in the Mal@@ dives tells us that it burns in the room of work .
and would it not be wonderful if we from the office have air conditioning on our early arrival on arrival ?
yes , that requires air conditioning .
but a dream is definitely going to come true soon : we lift our arm@@ our watch , say it according to `` Sau@@ gen ! - &apos;&apos; and at home the vacuum cleaner travels at home .
misleading .
everything runs on nothing less than a revolution : `` The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred : `` The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred , &apos;&apos; ra@@ unt a branch of industry , someone who can connect the washing machine with a headphones that shows the weather report and the details of the weather , and the data bri@@ efs show off how long the pizza

another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio show .
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza .
thousands of Israeli children from areas close to Gaza returned to school on Monday on Monday , when they had spent the summer in air-@@ protected areas , while rocket and mortar strikes on their communities collapsed during the 50-@@ day war between Israel and Hamas , and the schools in Gaza remained closed , while the area of fighting recovered .
the school start brought a feeling of joy and anticipation to the communities in the south of Israel in the south of Israel , but the signs of fighting are fresh .
in the southern town of Ash@@ do@@ d , employees of the `` Pas@@ ho@@ sh &apos;&apos; Children &apos;s Garden , which was taken by a rocket , arrived in front of the student of Gran@@ at@@ sh@@ ter from the walls and the sliding sides .
`` We have a bit of fear , but they are excited , `` said Ron@@ it Bart , a friend in the Ki@@ bb@@ utz Sa@@ ad .
many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine .
her 11-@@ year old daughter , Sh@@ ani Bart , said it &apos;s `` a bit funny &apos;&apos; to suddenly return to school .
`` It was difficult times , and we did not go out of the house at all , &apos;&apos; she said .
President Reu@@ ven Riv@@ lin , near the border with Gaza , visited Gaza to offer its support .
until a ceasefire last week , thousands of residents of the border communities such as Sa@@ ad remained in their homes , or they left their homes to move away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fires .
many inhabitants of Nah@@ al O@@ z , a municipality near the border with Gaza in which a four-@@ year-old boy has been killed by a Palestinian murderer , hesitate to return .
the Ministry of Education said that around one dozen families have not returned .
their children were provisionally accommodated in other schools .
Prime Minister Bin@@ y@@ amin Netanyahu visited a school in S@@ der@@ ot , a border town with Gaza that was hard to draw from the Palestinian attack .
he appealed to children to learn a lot and said `` we will make sure that their knowledge acquire knowledge and provide security . &apos;&apos;
Israel and Hamas agreed on an open-ended ceasefire last Tuesday .
the ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting ; important problems remain unresolved , as Hamas &apos;s call for a lifting of the Israeli-@@ Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea@@ ports in Gaza .
Israel demands a disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt .
in the war , more than 2,@@ 100 Palestinians were killed , three quarters of them , and at least 4@@ 94 children under estimates from the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel denies this information and estimates that it is at least half of those who were killed , but it did not provide any concrete evidence of this information .
on the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,@@ 5@@ 91 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities , most of them in the south of the country .
meanwhile , the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
the Israeli attacks were damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and around 250,000 people in more than 100 UN schools , which were converted into temporary protective rooms .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in protected areas , education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week .
`` I hope the school is back again to learn how we can learn how the children in the world and the Jewish children , `` said Mohammad Am@@ ara , a 13-@@ year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza .
after election in Saxony : CD@@ U-@@ Vi@@ ze Stro@@ bl , N@@ P@@ D-@@ prohibition proceedings question it .
in view of the loss of the votes of the N@@ PD in Saxony , CD@@ submarine has pronounced itself in front of the Federal Constitutional Court for an end to the current N@@ PM prohibition of prohibition in front of the Federal Constitutional Court .
Berlin - L@@ aut CD@@ submarine and Thomas Stro@@ bl should put an end to the current prohibition of prohibition against the N@@ PD in the case of the Federal Constitutional Court .
`` The N@@ PD performs worse off than the last time , &apos;&apos; said Stro@@ bl , who is also a CD@@ U@@ -Land@@ ologist in Baden-Württemberg , the `` Leipziger Volks@@ zeitung . &apos;&apos;
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that leads me to achieve the result of combating the N@@ PD politically and not before the Constitutional Court .
in the case of the vote on Sunday , the N@@ PD had failed in terms of the five percent hur@@ dle .
a first attempt at a ban on the far-@@ right party had failed in 2003 , because the protection of the constitution at the time had at the same time had the backing of the N@@ PM head .
in December 2013 , the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation .
the Federal Government and the Bundestag did not follow suit .
Har@@ burg : tents for new refugees
at the end of the day , refugees will now be accommodated in tents .
the head office for refugees in Har@@ burg runs out of all seams .
now the Home Office has set up three tents of the Red Cross in addition to it .
local politicians were informed only in advance - they do not like them .
`` These Ha@@ ur@@ u@@ ck campaigns continue to fuel citizens &apos;&apos; reservations , &apos;&apos; says the district leaders who do not allow themselves to be constructively involved in the humane accommodation of refugees , &apos;&apos; says Britt@@ a Herr@@ mann , group chairman of the Greens in the National Assembly of Har@@ burg .
your party demands that the district administration of Har@@ burg make unused houses available for accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
reasons for the over@@ filling in the initial intake are the ons@@ lau@@ ght of relief seekers - and the fact that the authorities can not provide sufficient places in downstream facilities
many refugees , therefore , remain longer than the normal three months .
home prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years , showing a widely observed index .
RP Data Core@@ Logic Hed@@ onic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August , so that the R@@ P-@@ data rose from Monday .
with this increase , the overall increase in June , July and August is 4.2 percent , the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual rise in prices was 10.@@ 9 % , more than twice the rise in the 12 months until August 2013 , but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country .
the Research Director of RP Data , Tim Law@@ less , announced that Sydney and Melbourne are using a two-@@ tier market .
the figures from RP Data show that home prices in Sydney last year rose by 16.@@ 1 percent , compared to 11.@@ 7 percent in Melbourne .
the following markets are Adelaide , Brisbane and Darwin , in which prices rose on average by five and six percent .
at the other end of the scale , Canberra , which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending , and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent , is at the other end of the spectrum .
Mr Law@@ less said that , with the advent of spring , an increase in the real estate on sale would now be seen for the next few months , which would subject the market to a real test .
`` If you look at the continuously high rate of auction prices , a generally fast sales rate and the continuously low interest environment , it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months , &apos;&apos; he said .
in an opinion to the New Press , he contradicts the statements made by the Managing Director , Peer Med@@ au , and att@@ ests to this `` like a Feld@@ herr &apos;&apos; .
the style of the university is not that , it is said in the communication .
for example , the Med@@ au family had been informed about the university &apos;s suggestion in the middle of June .
the statement that the plans were announced in July are definitely wrong , as they say .
at the same time , it points out that there are no `` preferences &apos;&apos; in the case of the plans .
it was also a matter of concern for access to access to the castle , although it was less dramatic than it was feared by the Med@@ a .
it has not been mentioned and has not been mentioned .
it goes at around 5.@@ 50 m , which is a metre wide than before , &apos;&apos; he says .
the argument of the Med@@ au operators that their free and independent parking areas in the future will only be used by students of the university will not be considered to be valid .
it is not possible to get rid of it because , like other public parking spaces , it is possible to solve it intelligently .
thinking of those who are living
the children &apos;s cr@@ ab , which is located on the grounds and on its doorstep the access to the park deck , is not intended to be `` damaged &apos;&apos; according to the president of the university .
what he has to bear in mind is that it is not only a matter of children &apos;s birth , but also the residents at the arrival of the Friedrich-@@ St@@ enses Street and the 800 students of the neighbouring Real@@ schule .
it is therefore a matter of much more than the vested interests of Mr Med@@ au , which is what he said .
whether the criticism of the child &apos;s wife of the child , with the expansion of the road , would be entitled `` the few natural spots of Cob@@ ur@@ gs , `` the reader himself can decide . &apos;&apos;
at the beginning of October , P@@ einf@@ l , in conjunction with the State Building Office of Bamberg , wishes to inform the city about the development of the development of the higher education by 2020 .
peer Med@@ au had last week informed the parents of children &apos;s children about the university &apos;s plans .
thus , access to the new park deck is not intended to lead to the campus and to the Friedrich-@@ St@@ alling Street , but rather the Med@@ au Berg .
this would mean that the narrow road on a kilometre of length would have to be extended twice .
according to the survey of the Med@@ aus , traffic in the park of Schloss Hohen@@ fels would become ten-@@ fold .
there is talk of around 2000 vehicles a day .
to date , the name of the city has not been allowed to express its opinion on the plan .
G@@ land@@ orf comes back from the hands of hand@@ ball .

the decision has not been easy ; it has matured over several months .
it is for me time to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team , &apos;&apos; the World Champion announced in 2007 on his Facebook page .
it will therefore deal with a balance sheet of 167 countries and 5@@ 76 gates for Germany in international retirement .

with the Is@@ lands , who announced on Tuesday his k@@ ader for the Land Games against Switzerland , G@@ land@@ orf conducted a `` long and good conversation .
his ideas and approaches have impressed me as much as my long-time colleagues and my successors will be enthusiastic about .
but for my club , I would like to be healthy in the years to come , for longer regeneration breaks which do not allow for the current double load .
in 2012 , the left wing had to fear his career .
because of the problems he had in mind , he had been treated by team doctors from the German Hand@@ ball@@ bun@@ der -LRB- DH@@ B -RRB- with a cor@@ ti@@ son@@ sprit@@ ze which had subsequently triggered a strong inflammation .
an emergency operation and two further interventions followed .
when G@@ land@@ orf announced a complaint against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional career and eleven years of national career go hand in hand with no body .
I have some health sites that I can no longer ignore .
after the three incidents of infection , which took place in short intervals in 2012 , I have never managed to get the grip on my blood pressure .
some of the complaints which are different come into play .
at the beginning of the year , I noticed that I controlled my head , but I could not deceive my body , &apos;&apos; G@@ land@@ orf explained in the interview the magazine `` Hand@@ ball Time . &apos;&apos;
for a comeback , it would only be available in absolute emergencies .
`` When all stripes break , I am always ready to talk , &apos;&apos; said the two-@@ fold family of family .
however , I can count on the years in which I can still play hand@@ ball .
I must also say that after my long period of hospital in 2012 , I have become rather humble in terms of my health .
after my career in my career , I would like to be able to go to some extent .
in addition to the WM@@ -T@@ itel 2007 , the Champions League 2014 -LRB- HS@@ G Nord@@ horn -RRB- and 2010 -LRB- T@@ BV Lem@@ go -RRB- won the E@@ F-@@ Cup .

in spring , German economy has shr@@ unk by 0.2 percent .
the crises around the world have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter .
from April to the end of June 2014 , gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent compared with the previous quarter .
this was shared by the Statistical Office and it confirmed preliminary calculations .
consumption alone occupied the economy in spring , while investment declined .
foreign trade , too , has slowed the economy .
for the first half of the year , the first half of the year will result in a total GDP increase of 0.8 percent over the second half of 2013 for the first half of the year .
Hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the goal of the `` Münster@@ land Moo@@ iste &apos;&apos; which led through the Burg@@ mann@@ s@@ stadt on Sunday .
on Sunday , the Burg@@ mann@@ stadt of Hor@@ st@@ mar experienced an invasion of the Dutch `` Fi@@ etz@@ er &apos;&apos; .
the largest cycling association in the Netherlands , NT@@ F@@ U , organized the so-called `` Münster@@ lan@@ de-@@ Moo@@ iste . &apos;&apos;
this is the biggest bike tour across Münster@@ land , the cycling paradise near the Netherlands .
with their registration at Jos , over 1000 participants from Jos thanked him for the organisation of this tour through the Münster@@ land .
advertising in various trade magazines was offered to those who were interested in this tour .
we come from Den Hel@@ der and are driven by night to take part in this tour .
we would like to get to know the Münster@@ land more closely in this way , but cyclists were happy about the route through the towns of Stein@@ furt , Bor@@ ken and Co@@ es@@ feld .
after registration in the club &apos;s club the protec@@ tors St@@ a .
Katharina moved to a small `` peace &apos;&apos; through the city over the Wall , where it was also the start .
further the route that was advertised for three different categories , in the direction of Herren@@ holz over the Schö@@ pp@@ inger mountain in the direction of Co@@ es@@ feld and via H@@ avi@@ x@@ beck and B@@ iller@@ beck back to Hor@@ st@@ mar .
on routes of 95 kilometers with 1@@ 175 elevation of altitude , 120 kilometers with 14@@ 75 height meters and 145 kilometers with 17@@ 75 height of elevation have proven to be a good condition for cyclists .
they were sold on the way to H@@ avi@@ x@@ beck and B@@ iller@@ beck .
the main organizer of Jos and mayor representatives of Heinz L@@ öl@@ fing were delighted to welcome the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved .
the organisation ran without problems and no negative incidents , &apos;&apos; Heinz L@@ öl@@ fing began a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately , not so many participants came as the organizer had hoped what was probably the bad weather forecast and the morning rain .
`` In 2015 , we will be back on the 30th of August or another weekend , but the cyclists promised to return to Münster@@ land , and the organisers are planning a new round .
Const@@ antine wake up , and he has had a mockery of honest mem@@ o@@ irs .
it is actually more philosophical testimony than Bi@@ ography , which has brought Konstantin W@@ ecker , Song@@ macher , paci@@ fist , polit@@ -@@ safe activist , ex-@@ prisoner , in `` monk and Warrior &apos;&apos; on 287 pages on paper .
in terms of thoughts of thought , his mem@@ o@@ irs , which was born on 1 June 1947 , wrote his mem@@ o@@ irs and started each chapter with a matching song text .
and he is ruthless in this : from the On@@ anie to the high school , he leaves no human weakness from school to store theft and drug use .
also how to show how he has learned tolerance in his dealings with his fellow men .
broad areas also take abstract , but all the more important terms : love , soul , ego , the being in the now , spirituality - all of this tries to go to the ground , on a very philosophical basis , but also in a very personal manner .
he also explains his paci@@ f@@ ism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also , as he has not only shaped the music -LRB- the opera lover became a soul and a rock musician -RRB- , it was also his imprisonment .
the latter brought the life of Const@@ antine W@@ ecker closer to the as@@ ke@@ tic monk who was born `` through sub@@ traction , &apos;&apos; as he says , `` by letting everything be removed . &apos;&apos;
there are also short stories about the earth between all of the highly spiritual views : for example , there are temples in one of G@@ Is , one of G@@ Is , or a crazy car ride in which he put a tree on the front .
here , too , he is ruthless .
lenny Henry : my father has never taken me into the arm .
has never said `` I love you &apos;&apos;
Henry was one of seven children of a family in Du@@ d@@ ley in Du@@ d@@ ley in Du@@ d@@ ley in 1958 .
his father , who died when Henry 19 was working in a factory was limited .
Henry tested for a comedy , Ru@@ dy &apos;s R@@ are Records , who was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father , from the series on Radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mixture of reg@@ gae and rap , with lively melodies .
but Henry had to work with some difficult childhood moments .
he visited `` many &apos;&apos; therapies after the death of his mother , and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
it was hard to know him .
you had never seen his face , only his voice heard : `` hö@@ r with the collar .
leave your sister in silence .
get rid of yourself !
I want to watch cri@@ tiques .
my older brothers , Se@@ ym@@ our and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things such as the shape of the beer or the beauty of a cri@@ cket .
I had never had a conversation with him .
much of my life was this serious type in the corner that the newspaper read .
Henry recently opened a foundry in Du@@ d@@ ley , and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father , he won a glimpse of how life was for him .
it is now a bit brighter , but they are dark , rough , deep sty@@ lized , with fl@@ ushing and smoke and a lot of rain .
my father once put himself in the tub and then he was able to hear him slowly how he started to sing because he was able to wash the foundry .
when I ran around , I became aware that he had done it for years to put the food on the table , and my respect for him was greater .
nevertheless , Henry grew up as a child without his parents &apos;&apos; love .
my father never hu@@ gged me , he never said `` I love you . &apos;&apos;
only when my mother towards the end of her life went bad , we began , `` I love you , I love you , I love you . &apos;&apos;
through his own daughter Bil@@ lie , with Dawn French , he was able to share the love he had missing as a child .
could you stop with `` I love you ? &apos;&apos;
ask me to change me !
dad , I am 22 !
with Dawn French .
why should n&apos;t we be friends ?
it is a great mother .
it is still a French friend who married him 25 years ago .
dawn is a good man .
why should n&apos;t we be friends ?
it is a great mother .
Hen@@ rys &apos;s own mother was di@@ ab@@ etic .
that contributed to her death .
when I became very , very important and showed symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said `` You need to be radical .
so I withdrew this fitness and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is difficult to do .
no one loves to eat car@@ rots .
Hen@@ rys &apos;s career in career can be seen in his elegant , short cut of cash .
since he was praised by critics for his Oth@@ ello , he was captured by the theatre .
it was followed by the comedy of the verses , and then F@@ ences of August Wilson .
this is another experience than Sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ partments that filled his busy working life .
he started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a DJ discovered him on stage when he im@@ itated people and wrote to New Fac@@ es about him .
his television career began in the middle of the 1970s , `` I was for a very long time of the only black I@@ mit@@ ator @/@ Com@@ edian on TV . &apos;&apos;
he learned at work .
I had to learn not only about the eyes of the public , but also before the eyes of the public , but also from 1975 to 1985 , how I could become an efficient W@@ itz narrative machine while I was through television a Star , and it was really difficult .
lenny 1975 at New Fac@@ es
since his manager had the stage law at the Black and White Min@@ str@@ el Show , a light entertainment programme in which people of `` black an@@ m@@ old , &apos;&apos; Henry carried out his comedy there for more than five years .
my family was very uncomfortable .
I wish somehow that it would never happen , but I do not regret that I did .
it was a strange , uncomfortable position for me , but I worked on gigantic projects and learned how to deal with a great audience .
but this `` years &apos;&apos; award-winning light pillar of British television &apos;&apos; was also a `` grotesque par@@ ody of black people . &apos;&apos;
through the introduction of figures celebrating British black culture , Henry worked in the 80s at an alternative Com@@ ed@@ y@@ kreis .
the first series of the lenny Henry Show went on in 1984 , and in the 90s he was known among others as the chef G@@ areth Black@@ lock in the Com@@ ed@@ y@@ serie Chef !
advertisements , documentaries , TV shows , and film roles were their next decade ahead , but his BB@@ C series Lenn@@ y@@ Hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv 2008 , but he thought it was next , because it feels like it &apos;s time you do everything that you do n&apos;t like the time you &apos;ve got a little bit on the spot .
after that , a documentary series for Radio 4 came out with the title What It &apos;s So Great About ?
the first episode turned out to be Shakespeare .
on Shakespeare , I was really allergic .
I had never learned something about him at school , and I thought him mostly for a domain of middle class , white in ti@@ ghts and a carbon head in the front .
so I was very frightened about it .
all who we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Tre@@ vor Nun@@ n , Adrian Les@@ ter , Ju@@ di Den@@ ch said `` You should try it .
do n&apos;t be bad if you do n&apos;t know what you are doing .
take a couple of words in the mouth , and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare .
Henry made 20 lines out of O@@ thel@@ los &apos;s last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic .
I had the feeling that I could do it .
it was almost as if someone had finally set up my head at last .
`` That is what it is , it is a serious thing , they take them seriously , they get your text , they investigate a bit .
the samples were brutal , and I read it for months before we made it .
and it was a success .
you seemed to expect a car accident , and that did n&apos;t happen .
and soon he appeared in the comedy of the verses .
suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could not believe it .
there was a moment when I thought , `` Oh , you have changed you . &apos;&apos;
there was a technical error and Henry instinc@@ tively felt that he had to maintain the audience .
`` A little voice told me `` You must now bridge 10 minutes while fixing the computer . &apos;&apos;
instead , the stage leaders announced that the idea would go on when the problem was resolved .
I went from the stage and something in me said `` Oh , thank God . &apos;&apos;
I am not responsible for it .
I can leave it to someone else .
`` You play in a play , so stay in your role . &apos;&apos;
Henry in F@@ ences on Du@@ chess Theatre
learning the text for F@@ ences was ambitious .
panic is very good , it strengthens the tend@@ ons .
that also came well , it is like a big shield of the gods who tell me `` This is your determination . &apos;&apos;
he says this , of course , with a th@@ undering voice .
so I stand by it .
I really do love that .
I love to be in a sample room .
Henry still has the head of a com@@ edian - our conversation is crossed by humorous out@@ bursts , while he is always im@@ itating people .
I decided not to make a stand-alone comedy because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction is somehow dangerous from a room full of stranger .
if you are looking for it forever , it will leave you in front of a wall .
I am going on live in the Apollo sometimes , if I want it , but I do not have much of it before .
I would like to ask him if he will once again become a stand-alone comedy tour .
the fun I have in a room with a director who helps to make a start , a middle section and the end of a journey - I do not think I want to give up again .
is this the new incar@@ nation in this case ?
I think so .
I am happy to be an actor .
it is fun .
you are always told about history , and that is great .
I love stories .
people love stories .
Hu@@ thi rebels block streets in Yemen &apos;s capital
in the conflict between Shia Hu@@ thi rebels and the Y@@ emen@@ i government , the Hu@@ this called on civil disobe@@ dience in the capital of San@@ aa .
Hu@@ th@@ i-@@ followers had central streets in San@@ aa on Monday , said a spokesman of the Hu@@ th@@ i-@@ Party `` An@@ sar of Allah . &apos;&apos;

in the surroundings , there is always a bloody struggle with the Y@@ emen@@ i army .
Kenya registered officials to contain `` ghost workers &apos;&apos;
Kenya has begun to register all public officials to delete `` ghost workers &apos;&apos; from the government &apos;s pay lists .
staff who would not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay that was a government notice .
the government has assumed that thousands of people will also receive salaries after their departure from the public service .
President U@@ hur@@ u Ken@@ y@@ atta promised to fight corruption in the public service when it took office in 2013 .
in a test at the beginning of this year , it was found that at least $ 1 million -LRB- 700@@ ,000 £ -RRB- was lost per month of payments for `` ghost workers &apos;&apos; and by other unfair financial practices .
the government assumes that salaries continue to be paid to accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service , W@@ any@@ ama Ch@@ eb@@ usi@@ ri reported to the BBC from the capital of Nairobi .
all officials will now have to appear in the next two weeks of identification centres to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are included in a government message .
anyone who would not have done it without a credible apology was removed from the salary list , which was the communication .
`` This action has helped to ration@@ alize the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and by fixing the pay list on both levels of government - the `` ghost workers &apos;&apos; are eliminated , `` said Anne Wa@@ ig@@ uru , the Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of decentralisation and Planning .
the scandal about art adviser Hel@@ ge A@@ chen@@ bach will be held in court on 11 November .
five heirs of Berth@@ old Albrecht , son of Al@@ di-@@ Grün@@ ders Theo Albrecht , are calling for 19.@@ 4 million in a civil process at the Düsseldorf District Court and 19.@@ 4 million of compensation from A@@ chen@@ bach and two of his companies who are in insolvency proceedings .
this was shared by a lawyer on Monday .
in the piano , A@@ chen@@ bach ordered the purchase of works of art as well as the purchase of books by Berth@@ old Albrecht when he paid higher than actually paid purchase prices .
in this way , the agreed commission was higher .
A@@ chen@@ bach purchased 121 million euros of goods for Albrecht .

he had 44 years in school service , including 23 as head of school .
from this point of view , Manfred Richter knows a lot of Peter@@ sh@@ aus@@ ener and Koll@@ bach from their time as a student .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but always supported by his desire to see people in the student .
snow is the best known mountain in the Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home .
judge was born in 1930 in Trau@@ ten@@ au @/@ Nord@@ Bohemia , today Tr@@ ut@@ nov .
at the age of 14 he became a secondary school of teachers after four years of age .
one year later , the Su@@ deten Germans were expropri@@ ated .
within half an hour , the family had to leave her house .
after a couple of months in a warehouse in 1946 , it was in the field of freight wagons .
that is how judges in the Upper Fran@@ conian region were stranded .
teacher training took place in Bamberg .
to do this , Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometers from the nearest railway station to Bamberg by train to Bamberg , where three kilometers across the whole city go out to school and return in the evenings .
after two months , Manfred Richter in a Rot@@ -@@ Kreuz@@ -@@ Home in Bamberg had a sleeping opportunity : up to 15 participants in a sleeping room .
in 1951 , after three years after three years of teaching , he made the second state exam .
since Ober@@ fran@@ ken had no free apprenticeship for him , he went to Ober@@ bay@@ ern and came to school in Koll@@ bach on November 1 , 1954 .
the `` milling room &apos;&apos; was his first `` department &apos;&apos; in the school house .
in 1958 he referred to a three-@@ room service apartment in addition to the school .
this house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school had been dissolved in Koll@@ bach in 1968 .
until then there were three classes in Koll@@ bach and Peter@@ shausen five .
from the year of 1968 @/@ 69 , they were summarized in Peter@@ shausen in today &apos;s City Hall .
when the school association In@@ der@@ sdorf was founded , only primary school remained in place .
in order to avoid a rec@@ lassi@@ fication in the smaller school , the then rector , Georg Sig@@ l , moved to Karlsruhe - while Manfred Richter became his successor .
but Peter@@ shausen grew , and children and their teachers from September 1982 were able to obtain today &apos;s construction , which was extended in 1997 to judge retirement .
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the senior mayor , Ludwig Gö@@ tz , who , in addition to municipal costs , had to build a workshop room and the extension of the building in 1997 , even though it was not eligible for support under the guidelines for school buildings .
`` Mayor Gö@@ tz was very indebted , &apos;&apos; judge remembered himself .
in his whole career , Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a lecture from a school council on justice and justice : `` You must never forget the love , &apos;&apos; Manfred Richter , who he had heard as a young teacher .
`` You have to give children two things : roots and wings , &apos;&apos; says today .
he had to learn : `` It does n&apos;t succeed . &apos;&apos;
in any case , judge was sometimes unconventional .
when pupils are examined , they did not get a penalty from him and were not beaten up at night .
at the expense of the community , judges had created two pair of boxing gloves and they had to compete against each other against each other , even if there were a number of them .
for the benefit of the school , judges in charge of school had a good relationship with the then Mayor Ludwig Gö@@ tz -LRB- CSU -RRB- .
this moved the non-@@ partisan judge after his retirement in 1996 in 1996 , at least as a last on the CS@@ K list for the municipal council in 1996 .
but judges were elected in place and joined the CSU .

HR@@ 4@@ -R@@ AD@@ TO@@ UR 700 cyclists set out in the spa park of Bad Salz@@ hausen and Sc@@ ots stopo@@ vers .
if cyclists on their tour in Bad Salz@@ hausen or Sch@@ otten R@@ ast do it , that is nothing special about itself .
on Friday , however , the number of views on the board and the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4@@ -R@@ ad@@ tour was accompanied by a break at the lower Kur@@ park of Bad Salz@@ hausen , and later a party under the open sky in the Scottish Alt@@ eb@@ urg@@ park .
under the motto `` Rad@@ eln and Festival on newly discovered paths between N@@ id@@ da and Kin@@ zig , &apos;&apos; the participants met at Bad Vil@@ bel on Thursday and experienced a concert by Van Baker &amp; Band there .
on Friday it became serious : the cyclists took the first stage , 60 km from Flor@@ stadt to Bad Salz@@ hausen and further to Sc@@ ots .
in Bad Salz@@ hausen , athletes were welcomed by the Mayor of Madrid who had taken part in Bad Vil@@ bel with the bike and the head office of Bad Salz@@ hausen , Petra Schw@@ ing-@@ Dör@@ ing .
for the refreshment of your body and mind , all kinds of things prepared in good things have been prepared : rural women from the city and the town of Nieder@@ -@@ Mo@@ ck@@ stadt have had 85 sheets of apple , kenn@@ el , stream and cheese cake , which were wonderfully interrog@@ ated by the skilled cyclists .
`` This cake can only ba@@ ke land women , &apos;&apos; a participant from A@@ ul@@ endi@@ eb@@ ach , while he did another bit , praised it .
cold refreshments could be found at the beverage prices of the Turn@@ club in front of them .
the `` Duo Bravo &apos;&apos; provided the visitors with famous melodies from oper@@ ett@@ as and music@@ als and invited enthusiastic applause .
the beautiful ambience of the park has been relaxing .
a gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : `` He deserves it , and finally he has already ni@@ pped circular bicycle chains &apos;&apos; today .
in the meantime , the mayor and the manager had to work : they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking shop of reporters Rainer Jan@@ ke and took the opportunity to advertise in Radio for Bad Salz@@ hausen .
since the first hr@@ 4@@ -R@@ ad@@ tour 2004 as a tour manager since the first hr@@ 4@@ -R@@ ad@@ tour 2004 in 2004 , he has had plenty of time to do a lot of technology on the spot .
when he communicated with three phones and a radio device with his staff and sent the 15-@@ member motorcycle sta@@ ples of the Police Hessen , Facebook wrote and made reports , which also needed a check .
`` Most of the participants are coming from the Rhine-@@ Main area , &apos;&apos; he said , `` However , from Gießen or Ful@@ da , Lauter@@ bach or the Taunus , and even from many cities in Westphalia , cyclists are allowed to go .
the number of participants depends on the accommodation capacity available .
in category I will place the participants in hotels in category II in collection accommodation .
from the spa , the cyclists had a good impression when they collapsed after one and a half hours &apos; time : `` Ch@@ ü@@ ss ! ! &apos;&apos;
`` It was nice in Bad Salz@@ hausen ! &apos;&apos; she came to leave it .
after the arrival in Sch@@ otten the group was allowed to pause for a short break .
but in the evening the cyclists were asked in the idyllic Alt@@ eb@@ urg@@ park .
under the direction of the Scottish Association for Tourism and Stadt@@ marketing -LRB- GT@@ S -RRB- , the park had been given a nice festive atmosphere and of course it had been prepared for chocol@@ ates , such as flame cake with well cooled spring white .
Mayor Susanne Scha@@ ab , GT@@ S-@@ CEO Markus Ho@@ ß@@ feld and MS@@ C-@@ Chairman Wolfgang Wag@@ ner@@ -S@@ achs in his role as a member of the board of the ADAC H@@ essen@@ -@@ Thüringen welcomed the visitors .
the Three were well pleased to hear about the `` many operation in Sc@@ ots . &apos;&apos;
DJ Tobias Hagen then gave the dance stage free .
in spite of the sporting activity on the bike , the opportunity for a completely free area of food has been eagerly exploited in spite of the sport on the bike .
among the guests , there were growing numbers of citizens who were as enthusiastic as the great spirits of cyclists .
on the second day , the stations of Bir@@ stein , Guardi@@ an@@ s@@ bach and Bad Or@@ b , including a concert with the Tren@@ k@@ wal@@ ders , were on the second day .
yesterday , after 180 kilometers of cycling , the athletes met again in Bad Vil@@ bel .
dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for `` conspiracy against the government
a total of 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey on the grounds of suspicion of a conspiracy against the government , reporting local media agencies .
the police authorities did not make a direct comment .
among those who were arrested , there are 14 high-level police officers , who reports Emper@@ ri@@ yet Daily News reported .
some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials , including four officials in government last December .
in July , a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they were alleged to set up an organized criminal association and tap phone numbers .
Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yip Erdogan -LRB- who was Prime Minister at the time -RRB- described her as part of the activities that are being led by the Islamist ghost in the wake of him and other people in positions of power .
not all children in Ukraine return to school .
schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday -LRB- 1 September -RRB- after the summer holidays .
this day is traditionally an important day for families , and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Arsen@@ i@@ j Jaz@@ en@@ ju@@ k brought his daughter to school .
there , he informed journalists that he was told , that not all schools had reopened , but that he decided to defend the country for future generations :
the events of September were not held in each school .
the sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the entire Ukraine , a vast common Ukrainian national front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
Alek@@ san Past@@ uk@@ how , teacher of school in S@@ law@@ j@@ ans@@ k , who visited his daughter &apos;s daughter , spoke in Russian .
we hope that peace will finally continue to exist here and that children will get education that will be useful to them in further life .
the first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , and children wear embroi@@ dered shirts , ball@@ ons and flowers for their teachers .
with R@@ ona Fair@@ head , the BBC has perhaps found the great director she needs .
it meets with a proud glory from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of the Tor party .
and she has its own front experience .
her career began with the global management advisory company B@@ ain and Co . , which she changed to Morgan Stanley , Bom@@ b@@ adier , ICI and the media world of Pear@@ sons .
she was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned as the chief post of the parent company Pear@@ sons to a younger male colleague .
it was estimated to be nearly 1 million pounds .
your political ranking , too , is solid .
it was recommended by Lord Brow@@ ne , the previous chairman of BP , when she was looking for more private business knowledge in Whiteh@@ all : she became a consultant in the cabinet .
her husband is a former T@@ ory member of the Council .
in May , I described the name of the chairman with a poisoned Kel@@ ch .
not only is the BBC as a vast and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
confidence acts in two directions : inside , the first guard of its own man@@ age@@ men@@ ial hierarchy in the BBC , but also outside as a voice of public concern and concern , when things run wrong .
this provides for an almost unsustainable Du@@ o@@ pol , which requires full comprehensive reform .
but what new leader it would risk going to go down and take on everything and an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while he may be doing his job himself , he would risk an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty .
it is a difficult task .
and as if that would n&apos;t be enough , many of you are interested to see the BBC to see power , money , and status .
while competition is approaching and new technologies threaten old and comfortable securities , the upcoming negotiations of royalties on the BBC are associated with special risks .
for the modest amount of 14@@ 5.@@ 50 £ per year , the British public buys one of the largest media companies in the world .
the BBC tells a good story : she says that it reaches 96 % of households and costs only 40 p@@ ence a day .
and it seems that the BBC is rising on the popularity scale again : 53 % supports them today , compared to 31 % 10 years ago .
the viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed : I get news on my mobile phone today and see my i@@ Player on my i@@ Player .
but it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found it .
Perry of Texas said that lowered t@@ we@@ et was not authorized .
a T@@ we@@ et from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas , Rick Perry , on Sunday contained a dam@@ ning remark about the democratic councill@@ or who is at the centre of a criminal prosecution against him for abuse of the power of office .
the T@@ we@@ et was deleted later and replaced by another of Perl &apos;s account , which rejected the previous one .
a twe@@ et has been sent from my account , which was not authorized by me .
`` I do n&apos;t approve of the T@@ we@@ et and deleted it , &apos;&apos; it said it was later news .
employees of Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
although the twe@@ ets of Per@@ rys dropped official user account , it was not clear who actually operated the feed .
in the former T@@ we@@ et , an in@@ exhaus@@ tible picture of Tra@@ vis County of Tra@@ vis County , Ro@@ sem@@ ary L@@ ehm@@ berg , was signed , which was condemned in April 2013 as a result of a change in the tax .
Perry put a veto against a financial promotion of its office , when she refused to resign what led to a charge against Perry - who might be a 2016 presidential candidate - a Grand Jury this month in Austin .
the text of the T@@ we@@ ets is : `` I do not always wear drunk with the three times permissible alcohol mirror but when I do it , I hate Governor Perry when he spo@@ ils it . &apos;&apos;
I am the most comfortable democrat in Texas .
L@@ ehm@@ bergs &apos;s office was not appointed by the director of the exhibition of the Grand Jury against Perry .
this was led by Michael Mc@@ Cru@@ m , a special prosecutor from San Antonio , who was selected by a Republican judge .
Perry argues in no way to blame and called the charge a political trick .
his high classification team of legal counsel applied to the judge charged with the case to dismiss the charge and argued that the law that had been taken against the chief governor in the history of the state of Texas is vague in terms of defam@@ ation .
Perry stopped 7.5 million dollars of government funds on the Public Integr@@ ity Unit of the State - which was established in Tra@@ vis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - as L@@ ehm@@ berg refused to resign .
this veto provided a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watch@@ dog group .
Perl official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes known .
after he had completed his election in Iowa during his presidential election in 2012 during his presidential election in 2012 , Perry went on to speculate that he will stop by putting a T@@ we@@ et of a photograph of a photograph of himself in the vicinity of a lake , with the words `` South Carolina , we come ! &apos;&apos;
Berkeley explains the housing market for `` normal &apos;&apos; again .
one of London &apos;s most prominent developers pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England has returned to normal levels .
homes in the capital were hot@@ est and subject to enormous price increases , which the Bank of England , due to widespread fear of a credit bubble , used to set limits on mortgage lending in June in June .
on Monday , Tony P@@ id@@ g@@ ley , founder and chairman of the Board of Directors , said on Monday : `` Since the start of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013 , &apos;&apos; and it added that this offers a `` stable operating system of action . &apos;&apos;
the housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn , as foreign buyers pushed into the capital .
according to information contained in the catalogue , prices in the area over the past year rose by 18.@@ 5 percent , far more than the average rise in England and Wales as a whole .
average selling prices at Berkeley &apos;s private , cheap and student offers rose around a fifth in the past year and exceeded the 4@@ 23@@ ,000 pounds at the end of April .
a stronger pound , however , has made real estate property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them were also deter@@ red by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible `` home tax &apos;&apos; before the general elections in May .
London &apos;s real estate agent , Fox@@ ton , last week warned that in the second half of the year , the mortgage market report for April in which more stringent lending rules were presented , in the second half of the year , would also lead to a reduction in market growth in the price of real estate at prices .
new data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July , which also suggests that the housing market is cooling down .
Hamp@@ tions International , another Real Estate Agency , revised its forecast for the rise in home prices in London to at least 3 % in 2015 , on the basis of an already weak profile on the part of the house .
the transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London , such as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington , has fallen year by year to a quarter , which is the broker WA Ell@@ is .
in spite of this , the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing , since the necessary amounts for futures amount to more than $ 2.2 billion .
Mr. P@@ id@@ g@@ ley added : `` The demand for the right product at the best locations at the best locations remained stable and remained stable as a result the sales of futures remained stable . &apos;&apos;
in June , the company reported that it sold 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost one-third more than the peak of 2007 before the crisis .
the annual pre-@@ tax income rose by 40 percent each year to € 280 million , around 18 percent in turnover and $ 1.6 billion per year .
in a communication on Monday before the annual meeting of the company , Mr. P@@ id@@ g@@ ley said that the revenues for Berkeley would probably correspond to current market expectations this year .
analysts consistently estimate the annual pre-@@ tax result to € 450 million .
Berkeley shares stood at 23.@@ 96 in the afternoon in London .
naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence will perform at the 8@@ 5th edition of O@@ scar@@ do .
naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a h@@ acker who claimed to have a `` master list &apos;&apos; of images of another 100 star@@ lets .
a representative of the star of `` The Tri@@ bute of pan@@ em &apos;&apos; confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are genuine and complained to hackers due to `` blatant violation of privacy . &apos;&apos;
the authorities have been informed and will follow all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence .
the photographs that were originally posted on the photo@@ -S@@ har@@ ing@@ page 4@@ ch@@ an were supposedly purchased by a gap in Apple &apos;s online storage system , which includes the alleged `` master list &apos;&apos; of the h@@ acker , the names of dozens of female stars , including R@@ ih@@ anna , Kim Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an , Mary Elizabeth W@@ enger and Mar@@ y-@@ Kate Ol@@ sen , reported Bu@@ zz@@ feed .
it is not sure how many of the images are genuine , although W@@ enger , star from `` Scott Pil@@ grim against the rest of the world &apos;&apos; also condemned the hack on Twitter .
`` On those of you who look at photos that my husband and I recorded years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are really satisfied with you , wrote WOT on Twitter .
Victoria Justice from the nick@@ olo@@ de@@ on@@ series `` i@@ C@@ arly &apos;&apos; and `` Vic@@ tant &apos;&apos; did not dispute that it was on the photos of pictures of her and twe@@ et@@ ete `` These so-called nu@@ t@@ pictures of mine are fake , people .

Bu@@ zz@@ feed reported on the late Sunday , when a spokesman of the pop stars Ari@@ ana Grande rejected the authenticity of the alleged photos of her .
exclusive excer@@ pt from Howard Jacob@@ sons praised new novel about love and the letter `` J . &apos;&apos;
they have been broken , so you could describe it in the best way , you could get rid of it slowly like a box that you &apos;ve had in the rain .
occasionally , a woman said that he is too serious , tiring , intensive , dist@@ anced , and may be a bit scrat@@ ching .
and then he sh@@ ook the hand .
he knew how to do it .
he was st@@ att@@ y , as was in I@@ gel , yea .
the last victim of this mockery was a very beginning affair that was more promising for alleviating the lonely bor@@ edom of his life , and it might even have brought him some satisfaction .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons was a tre@@ acher@@ ous beauty with un@@ told hair and a flat@@ tering heart from a village on the North Island , it was even even less than that of it , and he was defeated as a port .
she came to the south with an older companion to the south who held K@@ ever@@ n for her aunt , and had inherited a plot in a humid but heavenly valley with the true name of Paradise Valley .
no one had lived in the house for several years .
the pipes were l@@ eck , in the baths , there were still spi@@ ders in the baths , nu@@ c@@ ules had left their tracks on all windows and they believed that they were all of them , and the garden was monitored with we@@ eds that looked like huge coal heads .
it was like the house of a playground of children , both men@@ ac@@ ing and tempting , a garden full of secrets .
portrait of the author : Howard Jacob@@ son , his novel `` J &apos;&apos; on the Lon@@ gl@@ ist for the Man Boo@@ ker Prize in 2014 .
the short@@ list will be announced next week .
K@@ ever@@ n had enjoyed a very warm welcome to the most beautiful beaches in the world , and it was the place where he had to sit down in the middle of the mountains and get the feeling of it , and that is what he thought he had to do .
your feet are too big .
because of their own aggres@@ siveness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
it was not forbidden - nothing was correctly forbidden - simply was not played .
it has been successfully rendered obsolete , as the word becomes obsolete .
the general taste of what would have been done and what rules would never have been , and how the people in books choose the V@@ om@@ -T@@ eller , million@@ aire mem@@ o@@ irs , cook@@ books and romance of love , they chose the ball@@ ads at the music .
in the euphoria of the day , K@@ ever@@ n began playing an imaginary piano that had a lot of feet in a gro@@ b-@@ comic Seren@@ ade .
A@@ il@@ inn did not understand that .
`` This was a familiar song of a jazz pianist called F@@ ats W@@ aller , `` he explained her and he automatically put two fingers on his lips .
his father always had to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth .
it started as a game between him and his father when he was small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he told him .
if you add a word with a J without putting two fingers on your lips , it will cost you a P@@ enny .
it was not a very funny game at that time , and it was not very funny now .
he knew that he was expected to do so ; that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
A@@ il@@ inn had never heard any of them .
jazz was not played , although he was not directly forbidden .
the improvis@@ ing was no longer modern .
it was only place for a single `` if &apos;&apos; in life .
people wanted to be completely safe at the beginning of a melody where it would end .
also the mind .
his un@@ predictability made people nervous .
and jazz was musi@@ cally articulated .
although he had become 10 years of age without having heard of Sam@@ my Davis Junior , K@@ ever@@ n knew something about jazz from the half secret collection of old CDs of his father .
but at least he did n&apos;t have to tell A@@ il@@ inn that F@@ ats W@@ aller was black .
at age , she could not remember a time when pop singers were not black .
once again , there were no laws or constraints .
a compliant society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group talent - thanks to the fate of fate .
people with Afro@@ -@@ Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temper@@ ament and body construction , so that they ran and ran .
people who originally came from the Indian sub@@ continent , like nature , were blessed with electronic talent and were employed with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working phone .
what had still been left of the Polish community took care of the se@@ wers , which was left of the Greeks , crushed plates .
those from the Gulf States and the Levante , whose grandparents had not had the time to leave the country quickly when WH@@ AT had happened W@@ AR , took part of W@@ AR to be accused of being charged with fear of being charged with fire , even fearing that the flames would eat them as next - laboratories and S@@ his@@ ha-@@ Pipe restaurants were
each according to his abilities .
since she had only heard ball@@ ads , it was hard to understand how the insulting words that K@@ ever@@ n had just sung could ever become more expensive .
music was an expression of love .
`` They are not really insulting , `` said K@@ ever@@ n .
except for people whose feet are too big .
my father has never insul@@ ted someone , but he loved this song .
he returned too much , but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security .
nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon leaves .
A@@ il@@ inn still did not understand .
why would your Father love to love it ?
he wanted to say that it was a Ju@@ x , but hesit@@ ated to put two fingers on the lips in its present .
she already thought that he was rather strange .
`` It seemed funny to him , &apos;&apos; he said instead .
she ble@@ ached her head and blocked the view of his head .
there was nothing else around the world than it had had a lack of rab@@ id black hair , and nothing else to be seen in the world .
there was nothing he would otherwise want to see .
`` If you say , `` I do n&apos;t believe in it .
but that does not explain why you do it before me .
it seemed to be honest .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet do not do so directly .
perhaps your an@@ kles , a little bit to use it .
and you say you hate me because my an@@ kles are too thick ?
do you hate thee ?
of course , I do not hate you .
that is all I am talking about .
he might have said `` I love you , &apos;&apos; but it was too early .
`` My thick ankle are exactly the reason why you get me , &apos;&apos; he tried to do it instead .
I am a bit perverse .
that was not right .
it should have been funny .
when he tried to be funny , he was often in trouble because , like his father , he had not had the comfor@@ ting charm that was needed to cens@@ or the cruelty that is inherent in jokes .
perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he wanted him to be .
in spite of his friendly eyes .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons became red and rose out from her deck@@ chair , the console threw it out and swallowed the wine she had consumed .
the wine of Hol@@ less has nothing to do with it , so he has no excuse for him .
when she was raised , she appeared to tre@@ mble , how Palm@@ wed@@ el appeared in the storm .
`` And your Dick@@ head is exactly the reason why I feel attracted to you , &apos;&apos; she said herself .
in addition to that , I am not in favour of it .
she was sorry , both because of the lack of ease of his words and the fear that she showed in her eyes when she was opposed to him .
did she think he would beat them ?
she had not told him about the life of the cold northern archipelago , where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here .
the same huge and icy ocean broke out here , as it was on the banks .
the same confused men , with more thick@@ er and more twisted skins , which had happened to have been their ancestors as smugglers and beach rob@@ bers , moved from pub to pub , always prepared to raise the hand against a woman who refused or did it .
Dick@@ head ?
they would have shown a big fist if they did n&apos;t fit in !
you only stum@@ bled - the most frequently used word was the word for an erotic attraction between men and women , a counter to the un@@ speak@@ able love ball@@ ads from the console - they stum@@ bled and then beat .
according to Ke@@ eping opinion , this was an unnecessary refinement , since it was already an act of violence .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons gave him a sign with her body .
he rose from the deck@@ chair like an old man .
they also felt themselves , but the fate of his sorrow surprised them .
that was not the end of the world .
they were hard to know .
she saw him in how he removed himself - as a room on the upper floor saw her companion in it - a man , complaining about something he himself had imagined .
Adam leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a sudden pain for him and for men in general , although some of them had raised their hands against them .
a man turned from her , his back turned out to be ashamed , defeated , beaten , defeated , without combat spirit , why that was a sight she seemed to know well if she could not remember a single time she had ever seen something she had seen before today &apos;s day ?
when she was alone , A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons looked at her feet .
several years before the events that have just been told , ES@@ ME Nuss@@ baum , a intelligent and enthusiastic 32-@@ year-old researcher on behalf of O@@ f@@ now , the non-@@ legislative supervisory body in charge of public sentiment , in a short talk about the continuing violence at low and medium-sized levels in exactly the areas of the country in which their reduction , if it was not abolished , would have been most likely to be expected to be
`` There has been a lot to be done , and much has to be done , `` she wrote , `` to appe@@ ase the inn@@ ate aggression of a people that has led thousands of wars and has gained most of it , especially in the remote corners and valleys of the land in which the sweet breath of the breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in times when it was
but some of the properties in question turn out to be in@@ war@@ able .
the higher the church tower , the less the passion it continues to awaken .
the people who love to hear sentim@@ ental ball@@ ads are amazed to believe in stories about exaggerated difficulties in believing to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life , but it is not only the former crude that keeps rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in the hand , but also evidence of the emergence of a new and insi@@ dious dispute at home , in the workplace ,
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to exagger@@ ate , `` said her mentor when he had read the whole report .
I suggest that you read fewer novels .
ES@@ ME Nuss@@ baum lowered her head .
I must also ask : are you a@@ thei@@ st ?
`` I think I do not have to say this , I do not say , `` replied ES@@ ME Nuss@@ baum .
are you lesbian ?
ES@@ ME returned to her right to privacy and refusal of the statement .
femin@@ ists ?
I shall return to silence .
`` I do n&apos;t question that , `` said Luther Rab@@ ino@@ witz finally , `` because I would be against a@@ thei@@ sm , lesbian or feminism .
this is an area in which there is a lack of jobs .
we are serving a society that has nothing to do with it .
but certain types of hyper@@ sensitivity , which are totally acceptable and pra@@ ise@@ worthy , can occasionally distort the results you have presented .
you yourself seem to have prejudices against the church , and those things that you call `` ab@@ domin@@ al &apos;&apos; and `` ro@@ h , &apos;&apos; could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a power and vitality of course .
if you continue to walk around , when it was done , if it were going to happen yesterday , it would mean that if it were going to happen , the country will be able to take account of its essential vitality .
ES@@ ME Nuss@@ baum looked to speak while Rab@@ ino@@ witz spoke .
behind his head , a LED font in Flam@@ ing@@ or@@ osa told the advice that O@@ f@@ now had granted to the country in the last quarter of a century or more .
smile your neighbor , add your partner , listen to ball@@ ads , visit Music@@ als , use your phone , talk to your phone , talk to you , tell you , listen to you , agree to you , excuse yourself , excuse yourself .
speaking is better than silence , the spoken word is better than the writing , but nothing is better than love .
`` I understand perfectly what you want , `` ES@@ ME Nuss@@ baum responded with a very quiet voice when she was sure she had said that she had spoken at the end of it , &apos;&apos; and I am saying nothing other than that we are not cured as effectively as we are delu@@ ding ourselves .
my concern is that , without warning , we may find ourselves in the way of repeating how we repeat the mistakes that , when it was done , was carried out in the case of the WHO , which took place in the United States .
this time , however , we are not the others where we leave our anger and our distrust .
Luther Rab@@ ino@@ witz formed with the hands of a pyramid .
in order to show a patient &apos;s patience .
`` You go too far , `` he said that if you describe acts as `` mistakes , &apos;&apos; our grandparents may not have committed themselves .
they go too far when you talk about them having missed their `` anger &apos;&apos; and their `` distrust &apos;&apos; to `` others . &apos;&apos;
it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that if we understand the past , when it comes to the protection of the present , we do not speak of `` ourselves &apos;&apos; and `` others . &apos;&apos;
there was no `` we &apos;&apos; and there was no ` other &apos; .
it was a time of disorder , this is all we know .
`` When we are honest with ourselves , `` When we throw ourselves , `` did n&apos;t say any part of society to behave well .
I am not complaining about anyone .
whether it was bad or good has happened what has happened .
that was at the time .
nothing more needs to be said about this - we are in agreement .
just as no fault has to be assigned , it is not necessary to blame if it were appropriate and if there was a way to do it .
but , if we do not learn from it , it is a matter of the past .
the past is that we forget them .
if I may say something about this -
Luther Rab@@ ino@@ witz collapsed his pyramid .
`` I will remember her report , &apos;&apos; he said and kidnapped them .
the next day , when they went to work as usual , she was driven by a motorcycle driver who , as passer@@ s-@@ by described , in a kind of `` brutal anger &apos;&apos; was driven on the foot .
there are cases .
Les@@ o@@ tho@@ -@@ military member says that no coup is planned ; Prime Minister remains in South Africa .
officials in Lesotho , official representatives of the military , decided to have planned a coup to overthrow the government and said that they were against policemen who are accused of arming political fanatics .
Prime Minister Thomas T@@ hab@@ ane fled from the country and informed that the army of the country turned its seat and occupied government buildings in the capital .
the Premier brought his family to South Africa , South Africa , after reporting about attacks on attacks .
military spokesman Major N@@ tl@@ ele N@@ to@@ i , who said that there is no coup in fact , says that the military is responding to the threat of `` political fanatics &apos;&apos; that the police had put in place through the police .
`` What happened this morning was that the staff of the defence forces of Lesotho , after he had received several intelligence reports that , within the police , some elements within the police that actually wanted to kill some of the leaders who wanted to arm some of the political , party political fanatics who were on the verge of doing so , he said he
the South African leader in government , C@@ lay@@ son Mon@@ y@@ ela , said that military action has given the impression of a crash .
`` Even though no one has said that the government has seized itself through violence , all the reports on the fact that the activities of the defence forces in Lesotho are showing signs of a coup , &apos;&apos; he said .
spokesman of the military in Lesotho said on Sunday that the soldiers returned to their bar@@ racks and were quiet in the capital .
in the meantime , the Deputy Director , Mo@@ th@@ et@@ jo@@ ya Met@@ sing , takes over the governance of the absence of T@@ hab@@ ane .
T@@ hab@@ ane told us that he believed that he had become the target of his attempt to combat corruption in the country .
since June , there have been severe tensions in Lesotho , following the collapse of the parliamentary meetings on the basis of the dispute in its unity government .
he said that his actions did not undermine the government , despite opposition to it .
production in the eurozone on a 13-@@ month basis
the increase in output in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point of the last 13 months , a study that was closely monitored .
in August , the final Mark@@ it Purchasing Department Index of Produc@@ tions -LRB- PM@@ I -RRB- fell to 5@@ 0.7 , after a booth of 5@@ 1.8 in July .
an indication of 50 gives an expansion .
new contracts took place back , and factories experienced break@@ downs at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
the figures are meeting at the meeting of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- on Thursday .
the markets are expecting a clear plan from the Bank to the handling of the eurozone &apos;s hesitant recovery , and for the threat of deflation at a rate of inflation of only 0.3 % .
there is speculation that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , could give more details this week , whether it will consider quantitative easing for the eurozone , in line with those carried out by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis .
`` Although a small growth is better than no growth , the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers have become clearer , `` said Rob Dob@@ son , senior economist at Mark@@ it .
the Fabri@@ k-@@ PM@@ I for Germany , Russia &apos;s largest trading partner in the EU , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 5@@ 1.4 .
in the meantime , in the second largest economic nation of the blocks , France , PM@@ I fell to 4@@ 6,@@ 9 .
France remains a custody , as well as Italy &apos;s descent from a solid expansion to stagnation .
references to the fact that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism in Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands no longer take effect are not reassuring , as Mr Dob@@ son said .
the decline in industry is likely to attract the pressure of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives .
a positive message came from the Republic of Ireland , where PM@@ I rose to 5@@ 7,@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economic expert at I@@ HS Global Insight , said : `` The best thing you can say about the purchasing manager in the eurozone of August is that the sector will continue to grow . &apos;&apos;
he added : `` In the eurozone , producers in the eurozone are finding it very difficult to find the current rise in geopolitical tensions , especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine , in the more difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and the confidence of consumers , and is probably likely to delay or even cancel some of the contracts , especially large contracts .
he said that it would become more `` and more likely that the ECB must start a kind of QE , `` although we suspect that it will be limited . &apos;&apos;
the survi@@ vor of Beslan : ten years has passed since the terrible siege of the school : the children who it has had today are still suffering .
ten years ago , over 1,000 people from Chechen militias were taken hostage at a school in Beslan in Southern Russia .
more than 330 people , more than half of them , were killed in the three-@@ day mar@@ ty@@ rium that the world shocked the world .
we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped from the death of Gre@@ u@@ el@@ tat in the classroom .
exactly one decade after the horrific siege of the school of Beslan , in which 3@@ 34 people were killed , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned the heroic survivors last night before a new apo@@ calyp@@ se in Ukraine .
as fanati@@ cal Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004 , the start of a new school year , this seemed to be the evil of evil .
the tragedy united West and East in dis@@ g@@ ust , and surprisingly , it turned out to be in the midst of the worst misery in the face of acts and hope for the future .
ten years later , we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped from the death of Gre@@ u@@ el@@ tat in the classroom .
we have had surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hell will always follow them .
your greatest hope ?
it is now an end to the war which Ukraine is now searching for , and where children are dying .
the girl who was photographed in the experiment to climb back into the broken school sports hall climb back .
she was photographed and renowned by the Russian star photographer , Dimit@@ ri Arri@@ ak@@ ov , when she only tried to climb in her underwear to climb back into the broken school sports hall after a mine had exploded .
A@@ ida was completely confused by her mother Lar@@ issa , who is now 40 years old .
both were kept dead , but they survived .
`` A woman said to me that I should run around my life , but I could not say , `` said A@@ ida then .
my legs have had a blood@@ stream .
I stood up and climbed back to look for my mother .
a soldier brought them in safety .
after a series of operations , she thought she had healed completely , but yesterday said : `` Three months ago , the pain returned .
I fear that I must continue to operate .
some gren@@ ades are still in my knees .
their goal is to become a dentist in order to help people , as their doctors helped them .
`` This tragedy changed my life , but it did not break down me , &apos;&apos; she says she was fighting .
`` This happened to me , and it is impossible to change that .
once in the year , I am always in the sports hall to remind me of those who stayed there .
my friends and I try not to talk about it in other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future class@@ mate Dz@@ era G@@ apo@@ eva was killed there .
we did together when we were small , and we dre@@ amt to go to school .
`` I do n&apos;t want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career .
to a family , I think later .
she says that the siege will always remain part of it , although the memory of each year becomes somewhat weak .
I am glad that many people around the world remember our horror , and we are so grateful for the assistance we have received from people in Britain and everywhere .
when I see the photo of me online , as I go back to school , I think that many people see it for the first time , our disaster understands our disaster and helps to avoid happening again .
the boy who fled through the ball shark thought that his mother was dead .
it was his first school day -LRB- Russians go to school with 7 years -RRB- and survived the three-@@ day siege in the poor of his mother Tam@@ ara -RRB- .
when I was seven years old , he said : `` Mama told me that I should sit down when there was an explosion and keep their hands . &apos;&apos;
after an explosion , he thought she would die .
she said to him : `` Run . &apos;&apos;
full of fear that she could be dead , he fled and saw on the way of a wine , took it at hand , and fled through a ball gel .
his father , Vladimir , who closed his arm outside his arms , said : `` Dam@@ ir told me that his mother died .
he said , `` I could not save them . &apos;&apos;
in fact , Tam@@ ara was st@@ ole out , and with leg injuries in hospital , in turn , came to believe that her son had died .
after their reunification , she said : `` I am happy to rejoice .
I could not believe it .
he ran in and hu@@ gged me .
Dam@@ ir was later flown to London -LRB- from the now revised News of the World -RRB- to get the title of a Bar@@ nar@@ do &apos;s Children &apos;s Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cher@@ ie .
`` This horror follows thee every day , but I wish I could stop remembering that he said yesterday .
but I can say that it will shine in my memory .
I know that I immediately threw all my toy guns away .
but now I can play computer games with firearms , and that is not a problem for me .
`` I have no fear of returning to the sports hall , but I do n&apos;t think about myself .
I remember those children whom I played in the Court and who had not managed to do so .
we are never saying that they have been killed or dead .
we say that they have remained in the sports hall .
I remember my trip to London , especially to the toy shop , where I could choose everything I wanted to do , and the journey starts in a top open car .
but he has fear of a place like Ukraine , where wars are causing the kind of misfortune he and his friends have suffered .
this horror follows thee every day , but I wish I could stop reminding me .
`` I am very sorry about all those who are suffering under the abomin@@ ations , `` said Dam@@ ir , who worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery .
I will be happy to help .
I am going to go to the police one day and I hope she will take me next year at the Training Academy .
his mother Tam@@ ara , 48 , said : `` 37 children from our neighborhood were killed you can imagine it ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there was simply no children who could call and walk around , and this silence lasted many months .
she remembers her trip to London with Dam@@ ir .
people in London , when I told our story .
I understood when people on the other side of the world understood our feelings and showed their support .
she was grateful to Cher@@ ie Blair and her Foundation for the prize and the possibility of travelling to London in the autumn of 2004 .
I wish I could call Cher@@ ie and simply say that 10 years have passed , but I remember the meeting of you and her husband in London and helped me .
I remember how Dam@@ ir wanted to eat Bor@@ ash@@ sch and how to call them all local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he was playing with wa@@ iters in a restaurant .
and that was only one month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British shared our pain and supported us .
she said , `` I always think that this world has not become better in these 10 years .
the war is now continuing in Ukraine , and people are dying every day , and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are just such children as ours .
I think that for many of the war there is some of the news they hear when they are bored or are working with something else .
I simply know what these people feel all horror .
and I can not stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other , and that is so sad .
Dam@@ ir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not aggressive or angry at all .
he is not looking for revenge , for example , he is not overwhelmed with the last Gre@@ u@@ eln .
I know he does not like to remember it , but he has six close friends of the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and ign@@ ite the candles there .
when he was small , he suffered from it - I remember how he put himself on the sofa , the face of us , for hours .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he continued his weapons and other military toys , and Dam@@ ir is now 17 , bigger than me , good looking , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I was so safe for a couple of hours that he was dead and I would never see him again .
when I recovered after the explosion and came out on the legs , I saw myself , and saw the hell around me , with all the body parts that surround me .
I was absolutely sure that my small boy in that hell could have survived .
`` I remember that I stopped him , `` Dam@@ ir , Run , Run removed , &apos;&apos; but I was sure he had not heard me .
but he has heard it and he has gone away .
and thus life , unlike much of it , goes on for us .
Georgi@@ j I@@ ly@@ in , 17 .
the boy whose terrible image was taken after the siege to the symbol of the abomin@@ ations of Beslan
comfort : the Bes@@ lan@@ -@@ overseas Georgi@@ j Ly@@ in with his mother Fati@@ ma after the siege of 2004 , on the right of a picture of Georgi@@ j today .
his blood@@ stream face was created by fear when he ran out of his life , while Chechen terrorists ble@@ w down his class@@ mates .
his picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbar@@ ity of Beslan .
his mother Fati@@ ma , 54 , a doctor , had taken him off for his first school day before she rushed to bring her older son Wladimir to university .
`` I left the Court for about two minutes before the terrorists stor@@ med him , and so my small boy stayed there for three terrible days there , `` I remember it .
none of them was alone , a whole family of relatives was from us , but they were all killed .
only my Georgi@@ j managed to survive .
the closer this date is coming , the more it is to think about it and talk about it .
there is no single day in which we do not remember this tragedy .
we do not think it was long ago , I think it would happen yesterday , some scenes from these days are following me forever .
nobody will forget that , I promise you .
ins@@ istent : the image of Georgi@@ j -LRB- left -RRB- was one of the most shocking of the attack and was im@@ mort@@ alized as a statue -LRB- right -RRB- .
I remember that Georgi@@ j wanted to go to school this day ; he said that he wanted to change his teacher .
I only knew that he was alive when I saw him on television .
and now there is even this statue of the wine-@@ producing Georgi@@ j in San Marino .
Georgi@@ j does not like the picture , and it is hidden with us at home in the book@@ shelf .
I understand that , but I also think that the people of all over the world feel our pain thanks to this picture .
today , Georgi@@ j says today : it is important that this can never happen again .
`` I doubt that we have ever experienced the truth .
people are investigating such tragedies over and over again , and people never learn the truth .
and now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine .
are we going to know what it caused ?
this world becomes something terrible .
`` I do not understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , no one wants war , as it happens ?
ten years is nothing to do with such pain .
we need dozens of years to forget it .
it has attacked my health and I still feel it .
for three or four years I had a couple of night@@ mares because of the siege , but then it became better .
I went back to school later in 2004 , and I was afraid of every day .
I thought of my friends and class@@ mates who had been killed .
that is why I am always moving into the sports hall when 1 September approaches .
I want to pay tribute to my old daughter .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but I must do it .
I do not feel the sacrifice , this story is now part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I do not do it .
my life goes on .
I completed the school this year and visited a medical college in Vladi@@ ka@@ w@@ ka@@ z .
I will become a heart of heart .
my first choice was a training in the army .
I wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not leave it .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
Georgi@@ j Fan@@ i@@ ev , 20
the boy who survived , although he was caught on the feet of a murderous terrorist
a miracle : Georgi@@ j Fan@@ iy@@ ev was captured during the siege on the feet of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
during the siege he was caught in the sports hall and sat beside the bomb that was attached on the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is really a wonder that he has not been killed .
`` We feel as if it had been yesterday , `` says Georgi@@ j , who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer , but was unable to do so because of his health in the wake of the siege .
it is still with me that it is nothing I left behind me .
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with serious experiences - I must say that is not true .
`` In 2006 I worked with psych@@ ologists , then I felt a bit better , but I can not forget it .
and I would like to forget .
in 2005 - the first and the only time I went again to the sports hall - was the first and the only time to return to the sports hall .
I lost awareness .
I will never return there and do not ask me to tell you where I have sat in this famous picture .
overseas : Georgi@@ j Fan@@ iy@@ ev today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop
my pain is amazing and I am wearing it with me every day .
my friends know that I do not want to think about or talk about it , and they never asked me about school .
I think it is a good thing to do .
I should be careful with my injured knee , but I can now walk well .
but because of my health , I could not study at the FSB &apos;s secret service in St Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have submitted my documents , including medical ones , and they replied that it was not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have been behind me two years ago .
he learns about the treatment of all animals from cats to cows .
he said , `` I knew that I would never tell my children about my experience .
children should know nothing about this , and of course they should not suffer .
his mother Marina , 42 , said : `` This pain will never leave me .
it is worse in my soul , worse when the anniversary is approaching .
I shall go to the celebrations of commemoration .
I know that Georgi@@ j will not go on .
it must be much stronger for him because it was there and I did not .
I waited at home on him and could not help .
I am grateful to God for being returned to me , and all of this is drawn up in Beslan .
it remains in our hands .
Georgi@@ j is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept that , if something like that happens .
he is a boy , he may be sport , but he can not participate because of his knee .
he has been operated on several occasions , he can run , but he has no sport .
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50 % , but we can never overcome it and forget it .
we are always following this terrible experience .
many friends and neighbours were killed at the siege , and that only strengthens my pain .
I lost many people whom I knew well and which were expensive .
my son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that God was able to make to me , but my heart was crying out to cry .
I know of families in whom new children were born , but also wi@@ dows who have never married .
it is hard to accept that life continues , even if you do not want it .
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital .
and now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why do they kill each other ?
the war is now close to our country , and I can hardly believe it .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting ?
people and children are suffering , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and are still being killed .
if all of us could attack and throw out all of them , we can do it as far as possible .

she is now 10 -LRB- right -RRB- and does not remember the atrocities at all .
the world took breath in 2004 when the baby Al@@ j@@ ona was born in the poor of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan .
the terrorists allowed them to go , but in their cruelty they held their 30-@@ year old mother , the 10-@@ year old sister Krist@@ ina and her brother Mak@@ har in the school sports hall .
Mak@@ har , then three years of age , escaped , but Al@@ j@@ onas mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter .
since then , her father , Rus@@ lan , has married again and has a little girl with his new wife , Sw@@ et@@ lana , to call it after his lost daughter Krist@@ ina .
Al@@ j@@ ona , today ten years old , does not remember the siege and has grown up to an intelligent and happy girl , neighbours neighbours .
`` They are now a great happy family , and Al@@ j@@ ona and Mak@@ har are both great children , `` says a close friend .

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos .
if you want to make photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the cheapest option is a water@@ tight point And@@ -S@@ ho@@ ot like the Nikon Coolpix AW@@ 120 or an Ac@@ tion-@@ Cam like the Go@@ Pro Hero@@ 3 + Silver Edition , which both have to have for around $ 300 .
I have recorded these photos with several cameras , all of which are available at a price of below 350 .
regardless of the equipment there are some rules for the best results .
control your equipment twice .
even if you have a water@@ tight camera , make sure that the battery and other subjects are close .
place your camera on the photos or videos you want to record .
some of the cameras and cam@@ cor@@ ders have scenes of scenery and recording , which optimizes the exposure time for the remote underwater conditions .
and before you jump into it , check the extent to which your equipment is operational .
some of the cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , while others have up to 50 or 60 feet .
search in our purchasing guide and the evaluation of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
get multiple shots - because many will not fold .
point of cards have an LCD with which you can compose images , Ac@@ tion-@@ C@@ ams usually do not exist .
even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to watch it under water , and the right picture is a matter of luck .
so you get a lot of pictures .
if your camera has a string mode with which a series of images with slightly modified exposure settings are done , use it .
remain close to the surface .
the light is dramatically worse , and you continue to remove it from the surface .
if possible , you can stay close to the surface when you are shooting in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to get more color into your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
get close to the objects .
this is also a good advice on land , but it is even more important in terms of water because of the poor light conditions .
it is particularly important when you are working with an Ac@@ tion-@@ Cam : these devices often have a fixed angle lens , which means that you will need to use your objects to fill in the entire picture .
Andrew Law@@ son was a man of the variety whose character changed things , even in such a gigantic organisation as the N@@ HS .
as an advisory an@@ aes@@ thesia , he devoted his career to saving patients from the ag@@ ony of the disease as well as the end@@ ings of treatment .
in his patients , his wife was a MI@@ 6-@@ employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture .
Law@@ son knew that doctors are important to diagno@@ ses and illnesses , while the treatment mostly deals with something quite different : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one who began to do so .
`` I did not feel it , &apos;&apos; he wrote in May this year .
I had trouble to bring me up .
while he fought with the gri@@ p@@ like symptoms , he noticed that he repro@@ ached his wife Juli@@ et impati@@ ently .
`` I want to do everything as soon as possible , &apos;&apos; he said .
when Juli@@ et was on a business trip for a week , Law@@ son felt completely un@@ as@@ sail@@ able and without reason .
something was in the air .
he asked a colleague to undertake an X-ray examination of his breast .
it was only two weeks ago that he had been skiing in the French Alps .
the result of the X-ray inspection was the result of this .
he suffered from Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , an incur@@ able cancer that attacks breast hair , which attacks the lungs .
as with most cancers , the exact trigger is very difficult to determine .
for example , while some smokers are diagnosed with lung cancer , not all lung cancers have been smokers in the past .
but Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is different .
in almost all cases , the shutter release is an asbestos contamination - contact with the fiber optic , which was once considered to be a `` miracle &apos;&apos; , that has since been recognized as lethal .
for most of us , Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is a disease that can be easily ignored .
asbestos , after all , is a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960 &apos;&apos; s , when industry voluntarily committed itself to use it no longer .
where he was still used , only people in certain sectors were working directly with the fabric - plum@@ bers , construction workers , carp@@ enter and shipyard workers for example .
as an industrial threat from another era , it seems unlikely to be a matter of concern to today .
but this self-@@ satisfaction is inappropriate .
Britain , it seems , is experiencing the culmination of a Mes@@ ol@@ th@@ eli@@ ot epidemic .
there are more deaths from Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice the number of people die of this disease than in road accidents .
annual figures of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om@@ to@@ des@@ cases since 1980 and likely future deaths in Britain
the reason why we are now experiencing the deadly effects , although asbestos has been illegal for years , although asbestos has been illegal for years -LRB- all types of asbestos have been banned in 1999 -RRB- , a Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om has only developed after decades .
and the scourge of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is not restricted to former workers in the building industry .
asbestos has been , and is often present , in the houses in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop .
thus , Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om does not know class barriers , financial boundaries , professions or age .
the privileged bases , ranging from elegant department stores in London to private schools , are not protected areas .
Parliament &apos;s buildings are contaminated with asbestos .
the hospitals in which we are supposed to become healthy have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcin@@ oma .
Andrew Law@@ son was not old .
he was not a plum@@ ber .
it was indeed hard to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos .
then he found it out .
`` It looks as if in the tunnels at Guy &apos;s Hospital , where I completed my education for six years , a lot of asbestos , he wrote .
all - students , nurses , doctors and Pf@@ ör@@ tner - use the tunnel .
are you wondering how many people will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he was able to respond in part to this question .
`` From the four doctors who were trained at Guy &apos;s Hospital , he wrote about Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om in the last five years , &apos;&apos; he wrote in 2010 in a letter , `` I am the last to live . &apos;&apos;
how many of us will we become ill ?
at Andrew Law@@ son , Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was diagnosed at the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 February this year , he was 5@@ 5 .
it was an unusually long lifetime .
fifty per cent of all Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ omas die within 8 months of diagnosis .
the disease is always fatal .
we can therefore only repeat the question of Law@@ son &apos;s question : `` How many of us will become ill ? &apos;&apos;
the leading expert in the United Kingdom on Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , Professor Julian Pe@@ to , takes the view that between 1870 and 2050 , if the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to come to a standstill , a total of 9@@ 0.000 of the disease will be sacrificed .
most of them do not have any idea at the moment that they will die .
an asbestos mine in Quebec , Canada Al@@ amy
a brief glance at the files of the courts , to whom those affected are often dealing with claims for damages , shows the extent to which the scourge of the Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms is already widespread .
in June this year , Marks &amp; Spencer for example , for example , had to be exposed to asbestos by Jan@@ ice Allen .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship stores in Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her business at M &amp; S
now it has two children in the twen@@ ties .
`` Before this thing , `` she said , `` I had never heard of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , I did not really know anything about asbestos .
I would never have thought that it would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the concept of asbestos does not relate to a substance , but to a group of six minerals .
the name of the name stems from the word `` as@@ st@@ form &apos;&apos; , a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in construction .
Chr@@ y@@ so@@ til , also known as white asbestos , is by far the most widely used asbestos in buildings .
it has been used for roof boards , floor panels , pipe insulation , drilling , even for brake lin@@ ings in cars .
it is less lethal than other forms of asbestos , yet it is considered to be a `` big health risk &apos;&apos; of the EU and the WHO with possible death .
however , the brown asbestos -LRB- Amo@@ sit -RRB- and the blue asbestos -LRB- Kro@@ ky@@ do@@ li@@ th -RRB- are more dangerous than that .
Britain was once the world &apos;s biggest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that `` it was clear , however , indirect evidence that this was a main reason for uniquely high trade fairs . &apos;&apos;
a staff of Marks &amp; Spencer was exposed in the flagship store in Oxford Street , London , exposed to asbestos .
Jan@@ ice Allen may not have seen itself as a typical Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om@@ ancer , but the work of Julian Pe@@ to suggests that its history is by no means unusual .
he has presented a study of those affected when he states that `` a significant proportion of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ ome was caused by asbestos contact in the environment without a known suspension through work or in the House .
most of these contacts are based on the `` normal use and aging &apos;&apos; of our buildings .
it looks like no one can expect to be safe .
a report by God@@ dard Consulting , which investigated the Palace of Westminster , shows how people in the heart of the government , un@@ wi@@ tt@@ ingly , could have been exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , God@@ dard reported that service stations and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos behind Parliament &apos;s Committee on asbestos , whose lethal fibre could be swallowed up by something less like `` strong air movements . &apos;&apos;
Members of this House are often accused of dealing with their own interests , but that is where it looks as if the opposite is the case .
while the Executive Committee of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the West Min@@ ster Palace received a `` clean health certificate &apos;&apos; , it has now become undisputed that 1 billion has to be spent over several years to renov@@ ate Parliament to modernise electrical installations and remove the asbestos , and that , after the general election in 2015 , MEPs will probably meet in the nearby Q@@ E@@ 2 conference centre than the green banks in Westminster .
the God@@ mine report also pointed out that `` the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the provisions in question . &apos;&apos;
nobody can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
all that we can do is to wait .
a person who has never been able to determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t , a general practitioner .
like Andrew Law@@ son , the 50-@@ year-old Ab@@ bot@@ t thought that he had been exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
`` I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided , &apos;&apos; he said , `` but I can not prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all the places where you worked and the data .
what he is still reminded of is the day of early December 2009 , when he got a kind of fever .
he was 45 , and carried out surgery in the late evening .
suddenly , I had ch@@ ills .
it came suddenly .
I felt terrible .
I thought that the journey to the house could no longer be created .
as a doctor , Ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain of the breast hair , the skin was stirring out his lungs .
but , like Jan@@ ice Allen , he had no reason to assume a Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om .
he did not go to work a month .
doctors made copies of X-@@ rays of his breast and put Ple@@ ur@@ ak@@ ath@@ e@@ ther to extract liquid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory .
however , his complaints remained without diagnosis .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his job .
however , from time to time , the symptoms returned , often after sporting activity and severe breathing .
in 2011 , a patient came out with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om .
but even now , Ab@@ bot@@ t did not associate it with his own case .
after all , his patient was a few decades old and had worked directly with asbestos .
the connection in that case was clear .
in September 2011 , Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s condition worsened , and his family doctor brought his CT@@ -S@@ scans and X-@@ rays to a group of experts .
in December 2011 , when Ab@@ bot@@ t felt ill for the first time , a probe fitted with a camera was introduced into the cave between the reef and the breast .
I am an optim@@ ist .
I mostly do more , &apos;&apos; he says .
to be honest , I did not worry about so many of them .
but Rachel , my wife , was worried .
the result of biop@@ sy was the week between Christmas and New Year : `` It was said to me that it was Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om . &apos;&apos;
Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t : diagnostic Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om
suddenly Ab@@ bot@@ t had dates with Mac@@ mil@@ lan@@ -@@ nurses , one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer .
it is only now that he sees the extent of the epidemic .
`` It turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos , &apos;&apos; he said .
the people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill .
and thus , Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om now meets younger people who did not work in the typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes in hospitals in hospitals were located on Earth , so patients would probably not be exposed to the substance .
but many employees who , in pedestrian streets , moved from one building to another -LRB- such as Andrew Law@@ son -RRB- , or ate in underground cant@@ ons -LRB- as Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t often did -RRB- , came in contact with the toxic substances .
it is clear that , over several decades after the war , hospitals may have had life-@@ saving for patients , but are life-@@ threatening to the doctors in question .
it is still being removed today .
students from all over the world came up with the fuel they had on asbestos mats .
and it does not only affect hospitals .
the use of asbestos has often been used in offices , shops , libraries , and city halls due to its fabulous isolation and flame retar@@ dant properties .
there are also schools in schools .
in fact , a lot of people had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
in all over the country , in thousands of chemical clients , students have switched their m@@ ules to asbestos mats .
the issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed in schools .
in the meantime , innocent objects in our homes such as floor panels or scales of ps@@ oriasis contain asbestos by default .
`` It is a industri@@ alist that is included in large parts of our real estate , `` It says Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew Law@@ son in his trial against Guy &apos;s Hospital .
in one case , the only contact that came from a woman concerned was the demolition of a hor@@ ticulture in the 1970s .
you will be able to adjust your garden size .
the effects of diagnosis and the knowledge that the disease is incur@@ able is immense .
`` It takes a while to process it , `` says Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t .
I went back to work and tried to continue , but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I did .
I have been in practice for two weeks .
then I knew I had to go and take care of myself .
well , I am not going to experience another Christmas .
the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
like countless patients before him , he remembers how he was overwhelmed with all the information he had to get .
`` It was very difficult to include everything , &apos;&apos; he said .
`` I asked my doctor , `` How long am I ?
and I was given about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , `` Na I , I am not going to experience another Christmas .
that is what it was . &apos;&apos;
Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om is particularly insi@@ dious , because it is our lifel@@ ine mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer .
most cases of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos consists of small types of fibres .
when the asbestos is broken and the fibres are inhal@@ ed , they can set themselves in breast hair , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibres irrit@@ ate the breast hair and can trigger cell mut@@ ations .
`` The problem arises with the inhal@@ ed n@@ adel@@ ular asbestos fibres , `` Professor Tom Treas@@ ure , a heart of the Thor@@ ax doctor , who moved to Guy &apos;s Hospital in 2001 .
the hospital , of which Andrew Law@@ son expects him to be exposed to asbestos , is now , ironically , a leading center in the treatment of Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om .
Treas@@ ure knew Law@@ son and treated some others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital .
once the as@@ se@@ ec@@ kles reach the lung tissue , Treas@@ ure says that they are pushed by breathing to the edge where the skin is .
from the very beginning , it is from the start of inv@@ asi@@ v .
the usual options in other cancers are not as good as Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om .
the effectiveness of an operation , for example , is highly controversial .
some believe that they are worth trying .
Treas@@ ure denies this .
`` It is impossible to cut the breast coat , &apos;&apos; he says .
they do not come around with the knife .
in the meantime , cancer `` on chem@@ otherapy does not talk very well in chem@@ otherapy , but it does not heal .
`` Some@@ time there are long-term survivors , `` says Treas@@ ure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients are , in fact , long enough than expected .
author Stephen Jay G@@ ould died 20 years after diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t still fights .
after he contacted Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , Ab@@ bot@@ t came to contact with Andrew Law@@ son , who , four years after his diagnosis , had become a one-@@ man support and consulting office for those who had been affected .
`` H@@ ello , cancer of cancer , &apos;&apos; he decided to call him happily .
`` He was very positive , `` said Ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had received his diagnosis for four years and has still been very active .
originally , Ab@@ bot@@ t had been offered six chem@@ otherapy cycles , which would take four months to prolong his life only by a month .
`` I was desperate , &apos;&apos; he said .
I wanted to give up .
Law@@ son , however , managed to make things appear in a rather more positive light . &apos;&apos;
after consulting several doctors , Ab@@ bot@@ t decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Lo@@ ic Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ dun@@ ski , Herz@@ -@@ Thor@@ ax@@ Speci@@ ist at Guy &apos;s .
`` We had a advantage because I had to avoid repeating it , I simply called and got a date , &apos;&apos; `` There are Graham .
a normal patient would have to get a bank transfer and wait for the approval of treatment .
money is crucial for Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om sufferers , in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies .
but if these treatments fail to fail , many people are in danger of another financial concern - the future of the families that they leave .
and that is how they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Law@@ son contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Water@@ house LL@@ P .
`` It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health , &apos;&apos; says Morgan .
but what changed in the 1960s was that it was realized that a very low burden was a risk of health .
here , the negligence of companies started to play a role .
Andrew Law@@ son and Guy &apos;s Hospital eventually put their case , but it was not what Morgan called `` full compensation , &apos;&apos; since Law@@ son was unable to prove with absolute certainty that his Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was due to an as@@ well contact with Guy &apos;s .
after the investigation on his death , a spokesman of the guy confirmed that `` the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990 &apos;&apos; .
that was too late for Andrew Law@@ son .
how asbestos can be removed
in fact , it is an enormous problem for Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om-@@ sufferers who are seeking compensation , an enormous problem to associate a company or a job of deadly asbestos - decades after the incidents .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance records can be lost .
and those who resist claims know that the time is for them , but certainly not with the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
in response to this , there have been clear new legislation in this year which makes it easier for Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms to be compensated for compensation , even if their former employers are no longer available .
the law has set up a fund of 350 million for all the funds supported by the insurance industry for all that was diagnosed after July 2012 , it has been able to provide evidence of a contact , but no one can do anything about it .
in such cases , the plain@@ tiff will receive 80 percent of what a court could have had in a normal compensation process - around 120@@ ,000 pounds .
around 300 successful applications in the program are expected each year .
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms that 350 million £ was a `` very good work &apos;&apos; of the insurance industry .
`` This is a deal of ins@@ urances for insurers , `` he says , and it suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if time had not gone away , and the companies that had been told , they could find themselves and run them normally .
Mike Pe@@ aning , the Minister of Labour , Minister of Labour , said that the law was `` not perfect . &apos;&apos;
but both tw@@ inning and Morgan said that , with seven deaths a day , fast action is needed .
`` People are suffering so much and they need help today , `` said Pe@@ aning during the second hearing of the Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om Act in December last year .
at this stage , Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t has been in the hands of Prof. Lo@@ ic Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ dun@@ sky for 19 months .
after her first consultation , Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ dun@@ sky recommended an operation from which he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treas@@ ure .
this has been accompanied by radiation therapy and chem@@ otherapy - a triple therapy that can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent with the long-term drought of up to 40 percent .
Ab@@ bot@@ t felt stronger .
`` This is , of course , the most important thing , `` says Ab@@ bot@@ t .
this is something we can always see in patients .
there is something you can continue to do .
if you wake up , you get worse off .
Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t joined the operation in March 2012 .
at the end of August , he had the last of the six chem@@ otherapy cycles .
dessert scans did not show any signs of illness .
then I had a scan in March 2014 .
there were several cancers around my chest .

that is something to do with life .
once again Ab@@ bot@@ t withdrew six chem@@ otherapy cycles .
now , no trace of tum@@ ors is more visible .
but the process is physical and mentally difficult .
you need to think of practical things - about money , when I am no longer , for example , or my wife will show how the schedule setting works .
if you get bad news , you will get negative .
they must look forward .
as a father of El@@ lie , 16 , and Tam@@ sin , 14 , this is not always easy .
`` For parents that is hard , &apos;&apos; he says .
it is hard to know what you want to say and how much you want to say .
when I was given my first diagnosis , I told my girls that I would have a disease with which I would not be old .
they reacted very differently .
Tam@@ sin is very soci@@ able and hard to do .
they told them their friends and we got very many calls soon .
El@@ lie was more restrained .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients need to pass through .
but for Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om@@ ill , such talks are not crossed by hope , not by a trail of hope for survival .
the disease -LRB- as it is in the end also for Stephen Jay G@@ ould -RRB- will bring a lot of security .

China denies Hong Kong &apos;s right to government election , protesters swe@@ ating retaliation .
on Sunday , despite the increase in calls for democratic reforms , the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate .
this is likely to cost the long awaited protests in Hong Kong &apos;s business district , while activists used to manage planning and mobilization within a few hours after the announcement .
the decision of the Chinese People &apos;s Congress allows Communist leaders to dismiss all of the candidates who do not have no mercy .
`` That is not unexpected , but it is angry that we are angry , `` said legal expert Emil@@ y L@@ au , head of the Democratic Party .
that is not what Beijing promised .
it lied to the inhabitants of Hong Kong .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
in his defence of the Chinese decision , Li F@@ ei , Vice-@@ Secretary General of the Permanent Committee of the National People &apos;s Congress , declared that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be `` chaotic . &apos;&apos;
since 1997 , when Britain has returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese , Beijing promised to allow the population to elect the government office from 2017 .
the Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough , because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong a direct right to vote , but the decision also makes it clear that China &apos;s leaders remain in the hands of the process through a direct nomination committee controlled by Beijing .
according to a new clause , only candidates will be allowed `` with love to land and attention to Hong Kong . &apos;&apos;
the decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most publi@@ cized protests in Hong Kong have taken place for many years .
behind the pro-@@ democracy campaign in Hong Kong , Occup@@ y Central With Love and Peace , whose organisers have threatened to ab@@ rogate the financial district , is not allowed to dismiss the financial district if Beijing does not allow for genuine universal suffrage .
on Sunday evening , hundreds of Occup@@ y-@@ Centr@@ al-@@ supporters in the rain met hundreds of Occup@@ y-@@ Centr@@ al-@@ supporters in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong .
in the demonstration , the organisers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobe@@ dience and that they planned to plan protest in the weeks to come .
however , they did not make any information about it , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organisers informed that the movement `` the occupation of the central district &apos;&apos; was only considered to be the last resort , an action that would only take place when all of the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and do not have any other choice .
we are sorry to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place .
the authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for the announcement of Beijing for a couple of days , and there were stricter security measures in front of government buildings , including police forces and barri@@ cades .
the riots are exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the promotion of people from the mainland reinforces competition for products and services .
there is also growing fear that Hong Kong &apos;s values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crum@@ ble under the growing pressure of Beijing .
some of them criticised the demonstrations of the Occup@@ y-@@ Centr@@ al-@@ Movement , as they threaten business operations - the lif@@ eb@@ lood of Hong Kong .
`` The protests that they are talking about could do a lot of economic damage , depending on how much they are involved and how long they are going to continue , `` said legal expert Reg@@ ine I@@ p , who has long criticized the movement .
we do not want to stir up fears about Hong Kong out of control .
that perception is bad for investment .
China &apos;s government-@@ controlled media recently reported about the pro-@@ democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
in this summer , activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 78@@ 0.000 people attended - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong .
in July , tens of thousands of people participated in one of the greatest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region .
the tradition of school lea@@ vers in the United States has now been transferred to universities , where fresh performances are offered with the private aircraft .
we are happy to respond to this demand and offer Britain &apos;s first luxury travel service to students of today .
in order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university , the company also offers transport services such as private aircraft , Rolls-Ro@@ yce Phantom , Aston Mar@@ ten or Mc@@ Laren P1 .
Mr. Stewart also admitted that the service provided a security saving .
this service is an ideal alternative to students who would otherwise need to feed your belongings in a dangerously over@@ loaded car through the country .
together with our new V@@ IF@@ -@@ options we are happy to ensure that students achieve a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year .
a company spokesman said that no new bookings were made , since the service had only been introduced , but it added that `` students would book the service in the next few weeks . &apos;&apos;
the company also said it would expect a market for this offer to come out in spite of the tuition fees of € 9000 per year .
students today differ in their expectations and expectations from the students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with VI@@ F it is possible to do so .
the National Student Union , however , criticized the service as being excluded .
Meg@@ an Dunn , Vice-President of the N@@ US for higher education said : `` This offer seems to be completely separated from the lives of the majority of students .
many students who are beginning to study this month with the study are faced with a crisis of the cost of living , as the available financial aid in the form of credits and grants do not keep pace with the highly rising invoices for the simplest means of living , before they can even think about spending thousands of pounds for as little a matter as the arrival at the student residence
femin@@ ists criticise racial issues and police behaviour on F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
the un@@ armed teen@@ ager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
the participants raised their hands in the air and sang , `` hands high , do not shoot , `` while they waited before the funeral .
after two weeks of protests in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mon , because of the shooting of the un@@ armed teen@@ ager Michael Brown , the blog@@ ger Mi@@ ri@@ am Zo@@ ila Per@@ ez noticed a change in the online discussion of white femin@@ ists .
after their experience , white feminist commentators put gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequality .
while tensions in the Middle West , however , rose and received attention throughout the country , Per@@ ez saw that white women had turned into 100 % of the race .
in comparison with the responses of black women , shortly after the shots of 9 August , the personal essays with titles such as `` thoughts on F@@ erg@@ us@@ on of a white woman , &apos;&apos; and `` feminism is not only turning to the suppression of women &apos;&apos; relatively late .
but for Per@@ ez this meant an important change .
`` I do n&apos;t think you can find many people in feminism who speak about the white , and privileges speak in such high fashion , `` said it .
people felt compelled to express something about the incidents .
it is characteristic of the crisis we are experiencing and because the situation in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is so ethn@@ ically that it must express it .
for English professors of Cori@@ tha Mitchell of Ohio State University , F@@ erg@@ us@@ on had problems with black American women who are exposed every day , but are not considered `` women &apos;s rights &apos;&apos; in the cultural area .
`` I can publish something funny about me and my partners and get 150 li@@ kes from everywhere , `` said Mitchell .
when I find something about how fern@@ s are under siege in their own country , silence is st@@ ony .
`` How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public spaces ? &apos;&apos; she asked .
for black women such as Mitchell , who has studied racial , gender and sexuality in the history of the United States , there is no dich@@ ot@@ omy between racial and gender problems .
for them , black women have not had the luxury of separating matters clean@@ ly ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women are now joining the subject of race and gender in the feminist mainstream , Angela H@@ atter@@ y , Professor of Women and Gender Studies at George Mas@@ on University , says that its predecessors did the opposite .
`` Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were beaten , and the explanatory statement was almost always the rape of a white woman , `` said H@@ atter@@ y .
white women had to be involved in history to justify the lyn@@ ch@@ killing .
for H@@ atter@@ y , the division between white and black women came to the point when white women on women &apos;s electoral rights such as Susan B. Anthony analysed the country in the late years of the nineteenth century and established that the fight for the right to vote could only have been successful for each group for each group : women or bl@@ acks .
`` They decided to use the right of representation of women , and the right to the right to vote should come later , `` said H@@ atter@@ y .
when you remember such things , you are well aware of why white women do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women protect their hus@@ bands and sons .
even after women received the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women to be organized against the lyn@@ ching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lyn@@ ching .
the group was born nearly 40 years after the initial request for assistance from pages of black women , Mitchell said .
for Mitchell , the flood of white feminist reactions to issues raised by F@@ erg@@ us@@ on - police behavior , racial discrimination - is a mirror of time in which white femin@@ ists have played with the problems that black women have had for generations .
`` It would not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms do have the right of children &apos;s education as seriously as they do with the right to contraception , &apos;&apos; Mitchell asked .
femin@@ ists of the second generation who built their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contrac@@ eptive funds , try to understand what that means .
the well known white feminist activist Gloria St@@ einer went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown &apos;s release on Facebook and published a keynote article by Reb@@ ecca Car@@ roll , colum@@ n@@ ist of the Guardian , where she asked for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism .
`` I hope that women who have another , but parallel reason to understand a risk associated with the body - and opinions on race , which are significantly different in public surveys - that will lead to change , `` wrote .
although it is a question of more inter@@ sec@@ tional feminism , in which racial , as well as gender issues are raised , some of her comments about the issue of race in America are perplex@@ ed .
Christina Sommer , a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of `` Who st@@ ole Femin@@ ism &apos;&apos; said to She The People , that young men in the United States , especially young colored men , are more vulnerable than their sisters than their sisters , but Stein@@ ems &apos;s remarks about F@@ erg@@ us@@ on are contrary to their previous critique .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but , when the White House recently set up a small program , My Brother &apos;s Ke@@ eper , to help vulnerable young black and His@@ panic men to help , there have been angry reactions from many femin@@ ists , including Gloria St@@ einer .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is being pushed into the foreground of mainstream feminist .
after the US border police came up with nearly 6@@ 3,000 unaccompanied minors on the country &apos;s southwest border this year , the issue of immigration reform is once again entering the surface - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
Andrea Merc@@ ado , Co-@@ Chair of We Bel@@ ong Together , an organisation that mobili@@ zed women for immigration reform , said that for a re@@ consideration of the subject as an essential woman of women she must only publish the stories of immigrant women .
`` They speak for themselves , `` said Merc@@ ado .
when the vast majority of labour visas go to male immigrants , the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` These stories find a follow-up to the women &apos;s organisations , &apos;&apos; she said .
`` pig house &apos;&apos; in Ip@@ sw@@ ich stands for sale .
the picture of a house for sale was removed by the owners of the house , when it became clear that it showed a lot of pigs that had been made comfortable in the living room .
the detached house has a bedroom , is located on a private street in Ip@@ sw@@ ich and is offered for 120@@ ,000 pounds .
the details include a picture of the living room of the house - one of them that belonged to its head on a sofa .
real estate agent Conn@@ ells said that the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner .
`` The photograph was published erron@@ eously , and has been removed in the meantime , &apos;&apos; said a speaker of the company .
in the expos@@ é of the house , Conn@@ ells described the previous collection as a `` unique detached house with one bedroom . &apos;&apos;
although the broker has removed the image from the website , it still seems to be advertising material .
the home sale provided interest in the social media , when some asked whether the bond was included in the purchase price .
the SW@@ City Harvey has a new million@@ aire to win a new million@@ aire .
a lottery player from Harvey is this month .
the search for a new million@@ aire in the southwest of Perth will take place with a lucky winner who gets nearly 1.1 million dollars from lottery education on Saturday .
for the second time in five years , a newspaper kiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot in the draw of the first division , after 1 million in November 2009 .
however , the lucky winner has to register .
the store owner , Steve Forward , said that the profit for calls for talks in the small town in the southwest of Perth .
the city speaks of nothing else , and everyone is pretty excited .
we thought that such a gain could happen .
eight W@@ A-@@ winners celebrated last month in the first division , a reasonable end for a couple of happy weeks for the players in the state .
last week , a player from Cann@@ ing Vale became one of the five million@@ aires in August , after a couple from Bel@@ mont had only a few weeks ago had the mega-@@ win of 7.5 million dollars .
the winning couple had been playing for 20 years and he said that the profits allowed them to travel around the world and buy a new house .
the million@@ aire from Harvey is the 5@@ 9th winner of the first Division in WA this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
Le@@ oni@@ das asked in the gla@@ di@@ ator arena
it was not only the gla@@ di@@ ators who stood in the park at the first Rhein@@ bach Roman Day at the first of Rhein@@ bach .
however , the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday , def@@ ying the rainy season and letting us get enthusiastic about the historic spectacle .
there were a colourful variety of shows , performances , games , exhibitions and information about the times of the Romans and its significance for the Rhin@@ eland .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ ti@@ al fighters from the gla@@ di@@ atorial school `` Am@@ or Mor@@ tis , &apos;&apos; who used every rainy break to demonstrate their robust combat art in the arena that was prepared with soft sand .
gla@@ di@@ ator owner `` Le@@ oni@@ das &apos;&apos; turned out to be humorous and knowledgeable and sent his men in the ring to become the heroic second fight in various gla@@ di@@ atorial faces .
first of all , the `` Pro@@ vo@@ cat@@ ors &apos;&apos; were on the right arm on the line with the left leg and the left and the front line on the right arm .
it was followed by the `` Ess@@ ed@@ ari@@ i &apos;&apos; with breast shield , short sh@@ immer@@ ing and head of the head , as well as iron gla@@ di@@ ator helmet , hook and arm guard .
in particular , the appearance of the `` Retiro &apos;&apos; which joined the `` Sec@@ utor &apos;&apos; with t@@ wilight , tri@@ ke and Dol@@ ch against the `` Sec@@ utor &apos;&apos; was recently struck by the battle of the castle to the ground .
as it was in the hands of heavy metal , the shields and the se@@ wer flo@@ cked through the arena , that a fear and ban@@ ge was able to become the health of gla@@ di@@ ators .
but the imposing `` Sum@@ ma Ru@@ dis &apos;&apos; , the muscular referee , had an always attentive eye .
`` We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman period possible , &apos;&apos; explained Lorenz Eus@@ kirchen , chairman of the organizer `` Friends of the Roman Canal , &apos;&apos; the intention behind the spectacle .
after two years of preparation time , the theme park for one day became an `` O@@ pp@@ i@@ dum Roman , &apos;&apos; a Roman city that , like vice master of Claus , noted in his greeting word .
after all , the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region , but also Roman culture and numerous buildings that we are still seeing today .
remains of them were also seen at the Roman day , about `` Aqu@@ ä@@ duk@@ t marble &apos;&apos; from the eleven m high and 1400 m long Roman Channel Bridge , which was once part of the central location of the hotel .
the society of Frontex once and now exposed the supply of water and energy supplies , and business leader Petra Fri@@ cke knew , `` We are still making use of the knowledge of then . &apos;&apos;
this also confirms the degree of education that Ralph Hei@@ liger from `` Engineering Team Two &apos;&apos; from Rhein@@ bach , presented to the surve@@ ying instruments of the Romans such as Chor@@ ob@@ at , Gro@@ ma , or Di@@ op@@ tra .
the Roman villa in Blan@@ ken@@ heim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as brick stones from the original hypo@@ crit@@ es , the hot air of the sun , which once heated the Roman villa .
what was more , the foot@@ prints that had been left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago were left out of tone before they were burned .
in 2011 the Office of Constance at the Rhin@@ eland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the industrial park of Nord in Rhein@@ bach .
you have found an economic building that has been covered with a dar@@ e for drying cereals and some of them .
the building was probably a Villa Rus@@ tica , an agricultural estate that explained the archae@@ ologist , Dr. Jennifer Mor@@ schei@@ ser .
a series of objects from these excavations presented them in a glass of glass , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate nec@@ kl@@ ace .
the Villa existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ , until the case of the German@@ ys in the then Roman Rhin@@ eland , Mor@@ schei@@ ser is believed to exist .
in the course of her work , the children worked with the Roman wind@@ mill , similar to today &apos;s Mühl@@ spiel , or wrote them how Roman students used their names with metal panels on wax boards .
at the stand of the Roman thermal baths in Z@@ ül@@ p@@ ich , the children were allowed to use glass collections of glass at the booth of the Rhein@@ bach glass museum and use a heavy wheat mill at the stand of the Natur@@ zentrum Ei@@ fel Net@@ ter@@ sheim , which makes it easy to use the flour to make the flour for a bread or a cereals .
thanks to the name of two cold blossom@@ s , visitors passed through the park through the park . visitors came over at the impressive level of the city of the city , which presented the results of its `` Rö@@ mer projec@@ two@@ chen . &apos;&apos;
with a Roman week from 13 to 21 September , the municipality of Wach@@ t@@ berg will also be involved in the early Roman period in 2014 , which will remind us of the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago .
together with the home and historical union and the Wach@@ t@@ berger Wander@@ -@@ Association , the Association of Association and the People &apos;s Party of Ober@@ bach@@ em will remember thematic hikes , a lecture , cooking evenings and guided tours of school classes , as well as guided tours of the Roman history of Wach@@ t@@ berg .
for example , a Roman leg@@ ion@@ ary from his work on the adjacent Wach@@ t@@ berg will tell you that plants are presented as living thinkers from the Roman era and a funny lesson in matters of international understanding between a group of juni@@ ors and was offered by the Romans .
the Aden@@ dorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme in the context of a project week .
with the Roman Week the numerous remains of the Romans in Wach@@ t@@ berg are to be discovered again at the first glance at the first glance .
in the Wach@@ t@@ berger Rathaus , a small presentation to the fund of the Ber@@ cum@@ er Mat@@ ron@@ en@@ hei@@ lig@@ alism in 1879 will be remembered .
Eb@@ ola : the epidemic of West Africa &apos;s economy
the Eb@@ ola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies are moving away .
the devastating Eb@@ ola epidemic is a serious blow to West Africa &apos;s economy .
the harvest is rot@@ ated on the fields that mines are abandoned , and markets are orphaned - the virus has had difficulty in the region .
a number of international companies are already at a distance .
`` The Eb@@ ola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic , &apos;&apos; says the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kab@@ eru@@ ka .
Liberia is the hardest hit
`` It is a total disaster we lose a lot of money , &apos;&apos; says Al@@ ha@@ ji Bam@@ ogo , who sold on the second largest market in Liber@@ ias capital of Mon@@ ro@@ via .
on the market , only those who wish to buy food or disinfection at Eb@@ ola are required to buy food .
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus ; more than 600 people died in this case alone .
recently , the health authorities said that the disease has prevailed in every corner of the country .
the virus has also spread in Guinea , Sierra Leone , and Nigeria .
in total , more than 1500 people died , thousands of others died .
foreign companies attract staff .
companies operate from anywhere in the resource-@@ rich countries .
foreign companies such as Arcel@@ or Mittal are moving their employees , and several international airlines are no longer flying the regions affected .
local traders and farmers are also reacting : few merchants still leave their home locations to get a boost .
in some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia , which are under quarantine , the cocoa and coffee beans , which are important for export , are being wiped out in the fields .
farmers do not dare to leave their homes for harvest .
food Be short
`` People will always travel less , &apos;&apos; says Phil@@ li@@ pe De V@@ re@@ yer , Paris expert for the economy of West Africa .
the man for example , who usually passes on the market and sells its vegetables , prefers to stay at home .
the population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently : food is scarce .
in the markets , supplies of basic foods such as rice are disappearing .
at the same time , the region , which is heavily dependent on international companies , is threatened with an image of images with far-reaching consequences .
the biggest risk is that international firms avoid the area over a long period of time , saying Philippe H@@ ug@@ on from the French think tank Iris .
it is crucial how far the virus is going to spread and how long the virus will continue to spread .
investors can get the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone , and Liberia and thus to invest , warning H@@ ug@@ on .
the disease also pen@@ alises the difficult state budgets of the Member States .
the disease also burdens the national budgets of the countries that are affected .
the ratings agency , Moody &apos;s , fears that their budgets will be heavily impacted by high spending on the health system and in addition to the deteriorating economy .
the African Development Bank already promised to help the countries &apos;&apos; health systems with 60 million dollars -LRB- 45 million euros -RRB- .
the impact has already been felt in Nigeria , where only a few EIB cases have been diagnosed .
the oil-@@ rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected until now .
but , elsewhere , many people remain at home in fear of contagion .
also reservations in hotels go sharply .

in the afternoon , the distribution of the distribution of the Federal and Gau@@ ge is also possible .
a particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 firm dam@@ pers with their Dir@@ n@@ dl@@ n .
the festival chapel is the castle of Bern@@ gau .
the patronage has taken on the Mayor of Wolfgang Wild and Secretary General of State Albert Fü@@ ra@@ cker .
the original name of the `` Schütz@@ en@@ gesellschaft Tann@@ en@@ wald Bern@@ gau &apos;&apos; in 1907 was founded in 1907 when it was founded on March 21 , the association for social entertainment by means of an exercise in the use of room types and small food .
in 1937 , the Nazi regime led to the dissolution of the association .
it was only in 1964 that 19 young men had found themselves on the 30th of April at the inn , Lukas , who called the `` new &apos;&apos; patron of the `` Tann@@ en@@ wald &apos;&apos; Bern@@ gau .
Charles March and Adolf Ri@@ ed led the association as a champion of a difficult initial period in which it was mainly a matter of finding a club and installing the shooting .
as early as the fall of 1965 , the competition association in the `` Lein@@ inger &apos;&apos; inn with two teams started to compete with two teams .
in the following years , sports protection , which has now been organized in seven teams , was established in all classes up to the 1st of the Arts League .
the club &apos;s pur@@ ge each year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached by Rudi Meier for the first time in 1980 .
as the efficiency of active protection has increased , the number of members has developed positively .
after the association `` Lein@@ inger &apos;&apos; has failed to meet the demands of a modern protec@@ torate , the then Executive Board under the leadership of Johann R@@ inn has decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new `` Land@@ gas@@ thof Här@@ tei@@ s &apos;&apos; .
after a working performance of 27@@ 00 hours , on 8 May 1988 , Pastor Strasser for the new protec@@ tors gave the church blessing to the church .
one of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 4@@ 4th Gau@@ ge , associated with the ceremony of the new protec@@ torate in July 1991 .
on 23 and 24 April 1994 the competition association celebrated its 30-@@ year anniversary .
in 1995 , a Bö@@ ll Group was founded .
Josef Schmal@@ z@@ l became a member of Bö@@ ll .
a great challenge for the `` Bö@@ ll@@ erer &apos;&apos; and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Bö@@ ll meeting in 2005 .
in many hours of volunteer work , the members of the association last year modernized the rooms and the firing system at the Bern@@ g@@ auer Hof and put it up to date with the latest developments in technology .
eleven teams in lap competition

NATO does not want agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia as a result of the planned deployment in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis .
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fo@@ gh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is the founding agreement of the NATO Summit on NATO in 1997 .
the NATO chief , however , accused Russia of `` a stark defeat &apos;&apos; of the agreement .
`` Today we need to face the reality that Russia does not view NATO as a partner , &apos;&apos; such as Rasmussen .
documents and opinions from the Russian side show that `` they see us as opponents . &apos;&apos;
stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that it will strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe .
a pro-@@ NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that `` we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is needed , &apos;&apos; Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday .
Kiev and Moscow , some of them on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks on the settlement of their gas strikes .
the negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday , the Russian energy minister Alexander No@@ wa@@ k said on Monday .
it is still time for the European Union to decide whether it would also be a representative of the talks .
for weeks now , Ukraine has had no fuel from Russia because of the dispute over the price of gas .
finally , Commissioner Oettinger , Commissioner for Energy , had given a message between the two sides on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
Ukraine warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe .
Europe accounts for around one third of its natural gas from Russian sources , much of which goes through Ukraine .
Merkel speaks about power : toll is `` clearly &apos;&apos; toll .
now , the Chancellor has made it clear that it has yet to do so .
it is not , however , a licence for all of the details that has been made .
persistent concerns from the CDU against the toll on passenger cars have made the CSU increasingly strong .
after persistent opposition from its CDU , German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken of a power word for the introduction of a toll on passenger cars .
`` To make it very clear , she is in the coalition agreement , and she will come , &apos;&apos; said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CD@@ U leaders in Berlin .
however , Merkel did not stand up for the moment on a detailed model .
in the black and red state of government , `` certain parameters &apos;&apos; are called .
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dob@@ rin@@ dt -LRB- CSU -RRB- has `` made a proposal , and work on that is now going to continue . &apos;&apos;
the NR@@ W CDU , however , insists on its ` no &apos; to a toll on all roads .
Merkel , also Finance Minister Wolfgang Schä@@ uble -LRB- CDU -RRB- also made a constructive contribution to the deliberations on a bill .
in addition to the topic , Dob@@ rin@@ dt also talked about other ways of enabling more private capital to invest in infrastructure , for example in terms of broadband .
`` There is nothing special about it , &apos;&apos; Schä@@ uble dropped a `` mirror &apos;&apos; report on Sunday to replace his house with his own concept of paying motorway investors with toll revenues after the election of 2017 .
CS@@ U-@@ chief Horst Seeh@@ ofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the Cabinet .
his objections confirmed his objections in the letter of CD@@ U in Ar@@ min Laschet .
`` The coalition agreement has never been out of stock , &apos;&apos; said the Federal Republic of Germany and the Federal Republic of Germany .
in that sense , it is an important signal that hake has now announced that it will talk about the subject again .
opposition to the plans is also due to the CD@@ U@@ Land associations in Baden-Württemberg and Rhin@@ el@@ and-@@ Palatin@@ ate .
in the background , there are fears that a toll will affect small border traffic with neighbouring countries .
Seeh@@ ofer had asked for a commitment from the ranks of the CDU coalition to make a point of criticism from the ranks of the CDU coalition .
the left sees plans in the face of the dispute in the Union .
`` The Mur@@ k@@ s-@@ toll toll is dead , &apos;&apos; said Party Chairman Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger of the `` New Works &apos;&apos; newspaper -LRB- Monday -RRB- .
`` With the charge of tolls , the minister will fail . &apos;&apos; Dob@@ rin@@ dt wants to introduce a vign@@ ette obligation on all German roads that are supposed to start in 2016 .
according to the coalition agreement , domestic car owners are not allowed to be subjected to additional charges .
that is why they are going to receive full compensation for the toll on the motor vehicle .
the model must not , however , penalise foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality .
genetic disorder often mis@@ diagnosed
a bri@@ tin said that she thought as a result of mis@@ diagnosis for many years that she would die .
Karin Rod@@ gers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another illness .
she actually suffered from the Char@@ cot@@ -@@ Mar@@ ie@@ -T@@ oo@@ th disease -LRB- CM@@ T -RRB- - a group of inherited disorders that damages nerves outside the brain and the back .
Char@@ ity CM@@ T UK announced that mis@@ diagnosis is a common problem with CM@@ T because so little information is known about this disease .
some 23 000 people in the United Kingdom are likely to suffer from CM@@ T , which can lead to engine disturbances such as muscle weakness , an unsafe and curved side .
the disease is also incur@@ able and painful ; it means that the symptoms are getting worse at the time of time .
when Rod@@ gers was 13 , she believed that she had a disease with very poor chance of survival at Fried@@ reich@@ -@@ A@@ tax@@ ie -LRB- FA -RRB- .
Rod@@ gers thought that she would sit in a wheelchair before she would be 18 and before she died before his 30th birthday .
the mother of two children , who is 51 years old , said , `` As a child , I knew that I could not do the same thing as the others .
I fell constantly , and everything was going on for me .
I could never ride with the other children , or skat@@ eboard , it was often used to go and walk in the school .
Rod@@ gers said that , at the age of 13 , she saw her sickness after several operations after several operations for discharge of her Ach@@ illes and the length of her feet , when her doctor had left the room and read that she had suffered from I@@ As .
`` I felt guilty because I had been curious , so I told no one , so I told it to no one , but I went home , searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the F@@ A-@@ society , `` said them .
when I was given a reply , I was struck and I was struck in panic .
I thought I would be with 18 in a wheelchair and die with 25 , in which all my abilities would be lost .
I did everything alone with me and I planned my own funeral .
she said when she became 17 , she became aware that her skills had not had as much as she had imagined , and she asked her doctor .
it was simple , and I and my wife told me , `` My love , I do not think you have that , otherwise you will now heat it in the wheelchair . &apos;&apos;
I think you have something much less life-@@ threatening than that .
according to some genetic tests , their CM@@ T was identified .
`` When he explained what CM@@ T was , I felt as if I was a winner , &apos;&apos; she said .
Char@@ ity CM@@ T UK has launched a CM@@ T-@@ A@@ ware month to draw attention to this disease .
Lieutenant D. Bern@@ i Die@@ ther has been working as a fire@@ man since the closure of the former troops in force .
for less than ten years , the former troop level in Mün@@ singen has failed to shoot .
in spite of this , every month there are ammunition at the heart of the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b Biosphere Reserve .
the gren@@ ades are sometimes as dangerous as they need to be spra@@ yed on the spot .
one of the most important aspects of the bio@@ sphere has been one of the most important aspects of the bio@@ sphere .
in December 2004 , the last sharp shot was struck at Mün@@ singen , which closed military operations after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005 .
since then , the 6@@ 500 hectares of grounds are at the heart of the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b Biosphere Reserve , which is open on 13 marked trails for hikers and cyclists .
tax burdens on businessmen in the area of Washington are rising with economic recovery .
economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
public and local tax ministers for companies in the country rose slightly last year , while economic recovery accelerated , the newly published survey last week , and the companies in the area of Washington , and the companies in the area of Washington had no exception .
companies in District District , Maryland , and Virginia jointly paid $ 27.@@ 6 billion to state and local posts in the financial year of 2013 , a rise of 3.8 percent compared with the revenue of $ 26.@@ 6 billion in 2012 .
the state-owned and local tax burden on companies rose by 4.3 % last year to $ 6@@ 71 billion , compared to 3.9 % in the year , and it was the third year in succession following several years after the several years of a fall in 2009 and 2010 in 2010 .
government taxes rose more than local taxes , around 4.3 % , the study carried out by Ernst &amp; Young with the center of state taxation , a tax policy group .
more than half of District tax revenues , 56 percent , come from corporate taxes , while 36 per cent of its revenues come from companies .
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 per cent .
much of the rise in tax revenue has been justified in a recovery in the real estate values of companies , which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with rates of growth rates of less than 1 % .
while a large proportion of these gains came from large states such as California , New York , and Texas , it also seems to be meeting the area of Washington .
companies in District , Maryland , and Virginia paid over $ 10 billion in government and local estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 , an increase in the course of a year by 4.2 percent .
but the apparent recovery in terms of real estate is not as effective in the rise of government and local in terms of tax , since real estate taxes amount to less than one-@@ fifth of the tax concessions of companies .
companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their public and local taxes in the form of real estate .
`` In Maryland , a large proportion of the real estate , in particular in the tax area around D.C. , is either in possession of the government or of non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , `` said Douglas Lind@@ holm , managing director of the Center on State Tax@@ ation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other countries offer .
the recent recovery in tax revenue by companies can not be offset by the recovery of the real-estate market
revenues seem to recover , and that is how it is .
in the region , companies in the region reported 2.3 billion dollars of income tax compared to 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland accounted for $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
while the trend is heading in the same direction , the local tax burden on companies does not rise equally in all three places .
the rise rate in the district correspon@@ ded to 4,@@ 3 % on the national average , while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher than 4.@@ 9 percent .
only Virginia reported an outstanding tax rate of 4.1 percent .
Virginia , with 6 percent in all three areas of office , has significantly less business income taxes -LRB- all three of them have fixed corporate tax rates -RRB- .
the corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.@@ 25 percent and a relatively high rate of 9.@@ 9@@ 75 percent .
a similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that , in Virginia , public and local business taxes would be required , with a better fiscal climate than in Maryland .
in the study , the district has not been investigated .
in spite of its advantages , Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
North Carolina has adopted legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.@@ 9 % to 6 % , the same sentence as Virginia , and the rate will drop to 5 % next year .
if the state continues to achieve its income targets next year , this law could reduce the state &apos;s income tax rate by 2017 to 3 % .
in the meantime , it seems that small businesses in the area of Washington seem to go better , and they therefore pay more government and local taxes , in other words the recent study .
corporate taxes that are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure after which most small enterprises are organized - in the District , Maryland , and Virginia , last year rose by 20 percent to 2.4 billion dollars last year , a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes .
researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes in all of the country will probably last this year , with an increase in the government and local governments for the first three quarters in comparison with the first three quarters in comparison with the same period of the previous year .
nevertheless , the area of Washington could lag behind when the Federal Government &apos;s cuts in spending impact on the labour market in the region .
partner city : German beer for Guangzhou
h@@ ops and Mal@@ z - a popular combination in China .
German beer enjoys a reputation in China .
Frankfurt &apos;s sister town in China now wants a brewery and is also hoping for a flight of flights between the two cities .
German beer , brewed in Frankfurt &apos;s sister city of Guangzhou - is the appeal of officials in China .
`` We would be very happy if a German brewery were to settle in our city , &apos;&apos; said vice Secretary General Secretary of the South China metropolis , Li Yi@@ wei , this week when she visited a SP@@ D delegation in his city .
time and again , the functioning of the Chinese Communist Party returned in the course of the conversation to this concern of the twel@@ ve-@@ million metropolis .
Guangzhou , which is also known in Germany , is one of China &apos;s richest cities , war@@ b Li .
as a result , people were able to afford the purchasing power to afford to afford to afford German beer .
the H@@ ess@@ ische SP@@ D-@@ Chair Thor@@ sten Schä@@ fer Gü@@ mb@@ el , who led the German political delegation , told the host that he will listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany .
`` For beer it does not need much : good water , cereals , and vitality , &apos;&apos; he added at lunch with the party upper in Guangzhou .
this joy of life has already served Mr. Li , flat@@ tering the host .
after that , Guangzhou &apos;s role in Guangzhou came up with Schä@@ fer Gü@@ mb@@ el - with red wine , which was served at dinner .
the Chinese brand of T@@ sing@@ stra goes back to German brewing art .
T@@ sing@@ ta@@ o beer is brewed according to the German cleanliness of goods .
more business
a second request from the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou , Deputy leader Li said .
Lufthansa had offered the flight in the past , but it was cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons .
`` It would be worth it , &apos;&apos; local politicians were convinced .
`` The business of trade between our two cities continues to grow . &apos;&apos;
at present , travellers would have to take the det@@ our via Chang@@ sha in the province of Hun@@ an .
the administration of Guangdong province , which is the capital of Guangzhou , also hopes for the flight .
the Deputy Governor of the province , Chen Yun@@ x@@ ian , stressed this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats .
`` This is a very good idea , &apos;&apos; said Schä@@ fer Gü@@ mb@@ el - Chinese vice president Li Jin@@ ju@@ n , an intimate expert in Germany .
thoughtful partnership
Guangzhou , vice president of Guangzhou , hopes that Frankfurt will be able to attend a partnership meeting next year .
Li Yi@@ wei was already on the Main , but not yet in this function .
he came into office only this year , after his predecessors had been promoted in office for allegations of corruption .
the local party leader , W@@ an Q@@ ing@@ lian , also had to go .
action against the officials in Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against the corruption in the party and administration , which is being harsh@@ ly enforced by the Heads of State Xi Jin@@ ping .
the new leader Li Yi@@ wei had worked in front of his party career for an American company , which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China .
before he took office in Guangzhou , he worked as a top manager in Fuj@@ ian , where the car VW built a large factory .
Frankfurt has officially entered a number of town@@ -@@ tw@@ inning projects .
the connection to Guangzhou in 9000 km is one of those that are maintained by both sides , for example with a student exchange of pupils .
last year , the 25th anniversary of the German-@@ Chinese connection was celebrated .
with its economic power , the South Chinese metropolis with its economic power is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen .
next year it would like to achieve a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion , he reported .
the family of Joan Rivers `` expresses the thumb &apos;&apos;

Amazon buys T@@ TR@@ s for $ 1.@@ 04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed what information had been reported on Monday morning : the online retailer and video producer , and a lot of other things - buys the video streaming service to $ 1.@@ 04 billion -LRB- 9@@ 70 million USD -RRB- .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one had expected a takeover of T@@ navigation , but because it was widely assumed that YouTube would purchase the company .
three months ago it looked as if the sale of T@@ switches to the video service of Google was decided on by Google for a cool billion , and cooperation also appeared , of course .
T@@ Plug , which was founded only three years ago as Ju@@ stin@@ .@@ tv , was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
instead , it became a platform for players who wanted to release their Bra@@ vo@@ ur@@ pieces in games , a YouTube for live games , .
the Twitter interface .
and `` let &apos;s play , &apos;&apos; a video genre in which better know the -LRB- mostly older -RRB- games a painting of the secret theater of knowledge is very popular on YouTube .
it is just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe T@@ navigation , so the news that YouTube has wanted to buy it was added something bored , a textbook example of an established technology that buys a potential competitor .
it is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come about , as the company reported that it was ready to pay much of it as Amazon .
all that we know at the moment is this statement of Em@@ met Sh@@ ar , President of T@@ TR@@ E : `` We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community , share our values and long-term visions , and want to help us get there faster . &apos;&apos;
another secret is , honestly , the incredible success of T@@ TR@@ E .
for sno@@ bs like me , who explain that they prefer to do sport than to do it , it is hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others at games instead of the control panel .
it is a matter to watch a friend at 3 a.m. in the morning about the shoulder to watch , while she is easy to watch through resident evil , and something quite different , to see how he can shoot 20 times in Call of Duty .
you could take a look at all of these games now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games today are E@@ go-@@ games , so it can be a good recipe for headaches without your own control over the viewing perspective .
I admit that the quick runs in which the Roger Bann@@ ers of our electronic age are completing all games in record time are entertaining .
but as long as it is not a game or a human virtu@@ oso , his Twitter channel is probably not so interesting .
but what kind of sceptics do I know about it ?
it has 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic .
and how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it ?
it is hard to imagine that T@@ TR@@ E will be elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video , where YouTube T@@ TR@@ s could easily swallow .
but T@@ TR@@ E has something that each company would like to see : thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers .
as the chairman of T@@ TR@@ E , she@@ ar , said , Amazon and T@@ TR@@ E believe in the future of gaming , `` and the medium does not show any signs of a contraction , even no more - as a spectator .
on the side of the castle there was a lot of fun on Sundays .
the concept of the organisers was agreed .
in spite of the intense rain on Saturday evening , an estimated 1200 music fans came to the Open Air@@ -F@@ est in the Burg@@ garten .
at times it has had to be stopped .
`` That was annoying , &apos;&apos; said Ron S@@ em , one of the organizers .
it is a perfect place to relax .
from two Spanish words , Maxim Sach@@ ra@@ j and Ron S@@ em formed the name of Am@@ ula .
after all , the Open Air in the Sal@@ zw@@ edel@@ er Burg@@ garten will radi@@ ate the brightness of the day and the evening with a variety of shows .
well , and the fun comes out anyway .
this was already apparent on the early morning , when the first visitors to the Open Air were invited to join us .
the organisers had promised a feast for all generations .
and they have succeeded in doing so .
all around the power stations on the Burg@@ garten meadow had made it comfortable , while guests from closer and more intimate surroundings were able to do it .
they followed the first live performances , and they enjoyed cool drinks with the foot in the beat , in short : pure relaxation and enjoyment of enjoyment .
and all over the generations .
while some of them were lying on the beach bar on the beach bar , some of them moved to a quarter of wine in the Vin@@ othek , where the children moved to the hip , which was a great attraction for the smaller guests .
however , the volunteers in the tru@@ est sense of the word had to do all of their hands in the tru@@ est sense of the word in order to become the And@@ rang Lord and to create imaginative creations in the small faces .
the bigger ones took advantage of the kick@@ er@@ tables or took part in a skat@@ eboard workshop that the Good@@ foot crew created from Sal@@ zw@@ edel .
until the big rain came .
shortly before 5.30 p.m. he met with visitors to the visitors , especially families looked at the space and dried .
but the attractiveness of the festival did not detract from it .
`` There were more people than expected , &apos;&apos; said Ron S@@ em , who spoke of a `` success on the whole line .
that is why there is nothing contrary to a repeat of the great party next year .
although work needs to be done on the content and size of the event , S@@ em made clear a first record on Sunday in front of the popular vote .
he described it as annoying that in the meantime it had to be stopped .
it was obvious that the security company had been booked with too little power .
the result : some who had already paid did not get into the terrain anymore .
the response was very good .
in a first cautious estimate the Sal@@ zw@@ edel@@ er spoke of about 1200 visitors , who had tum@@ bled in the castle garden .
there were problems with sound technology .
the Sal@@ zw@@ edel@@ er Hip@@ -@@ Hop band of Block@@ s@@  Ro@@ x broke her appearance so as it was turned out .
the technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound .
the planned S@@ his@@ ha@@ -@@ lounges could not be built because the tents were not able to be brought to Sal@@ zw@@ edel because of a tire cup .
`` The next year , they will be in the process , &apos;&apos; says the organizer .
the premiere of the Am@@ ul@@ a-@@ Open Air@@ s was more than possible from the number of visitors .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organisers have made a few mistakes which will still be lost in the first time , but which must be eliminated in the second edition .
also in the social network of Facebook , the organisers have to enter into criticism .
`` sorry , but for 12 euros you &apos;ve expected more , &apos;&apos; Mel@@ anie Meier commented on the event page .
`` You &apos;ve taken a bit of it to you , &apos;&apos; says E@@ le Zimmermann at the same place .
others do not see the initial problems very closely .
I think it is very good that some of them are not just stupid , but are really trying to put things on their feet .
beware off ! , &apos;&apos; Steph@@ anie Jen@@ ß writes to Am@@ ula .
now , the organisers have time to put a stop to these criticisms .
new Rad@@ om in Berk@@ um : Wach@@ t@@ berg &apos;s landmark
it is not expected to do so .
instead , the component that is ready will wait to be used in the distinctive building .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : nearly 50 years after the establishment of the Space Monitoring Radar T@@ ira has been completely renewed .
with a diameter of 4@@ 7.5 metres , the new wheel will be slightly smaller than the old one .
but the size still remains world record .
the last step towards completion of the new shell is the Kapp@@ ade .
the upper part of the old shell is disconnected and taken away with a crane .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell will be set up .
if the weather is involved , the action at the beginning of this week will go through the stage .

this I@@ ce-@@ Buck@@ et-@@ Challenge went painful next to it .
a woman was sent to hospital after she had so much trouble with the I@@ ce-@@ Buck@@ et-@@ Challenge that she gave out the jaw .
Is@@ abelle Roberts from the United Kingdom ra@@ ced as much as its icy water was cast over the head to hurt her face structure .
`` The water was so cold that I scre@@ amed , and while I do it , my jaw remained simple , &apos;&apos; said she in front of The Mirror .
ice water is covered by the 20-@@ year-old .

I wanted to close my mouth , but that did not go , the jaw was lost , and then I understood that something did not agree .
my mother and my sister saw it also and made it out in front of laughter almost into trousers , but I had to get into the emergency .
the 20-@@ year-old from the United Kingdom was sent to hospital to return to the jaw after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday .

are the castle clubs going to join forces again ?
last but not least , there has been nothing to do with what happened to the two Wol@@ frat@@ sh@@ aus@@ er of Burgundy .
now we are thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the Wol@@ frat@@ sh@@ aus@@ er castle , the late Richard Dim@@ bath , a former chairman of the Wol@@ frat@@ sh@@ aus@@ er Castle of Burgundy , led the project in the French Gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
only a year ago there was no good climate between the Burg@@ verein and the castle friends Wol@@ frat@@ shausen .
there seemed to be very different approaches to the way in which the history of the Wol@@ frat@@ sh@@ aus@@ er Castle and possible reconstruction are going to be dealt with .
now the two camps are moving together : talks about joint action are to be held very soon .
this is confirmed by the local councils of Tor@@ sten Sj@@ ö@@ berg -LRB- Burg@@ verein -RRB- and Herbert Pi@@ ff@@ l -LRB- Burgundy -RRB- on demand of our newspaper .
`` I called Mr Pi@@ ff@@ l and proposed that we could sit together , &apos;&apos; Sj@@ ö@@ berg reported .
in his opinion , all of the members of both clubs could join forces in the future .
progress has been faster than that .
while the members of the castle were interested in the restoration of the castle on the mountain forest , the castle association around Sj@@ ö@@ berg is at the forefront of the building of the grounds .
Herbert Pi@@ ff@@ l , chairman of the castle friends , was very pleased to hear his own details about the call .
since Dim@@ al has died , he is a member of the castle .
a new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in the middle of September .
currently , the association has around 40 members in terms of 7@@ 4-@@ year olds .
`` After the death of my friend , Richard Dim@@ bath , we had to leave the club activities out of respect first , &apos;&apos; this `` period &apos;&apos; of thought was necessary to `` think how it could continue . &apos;&apos;
according to Pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chair@@ person will then go into the conversation with the Burg@@ verein .
until then , the people of Burgundy could also make a current mood picture within their group .
there are currently no candidates for the presidency , says Pi@@ ff@@ l .
`` But I am confident that someone will find himself , &apos;&apos; he does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad T@@ öl@@ z .
the new leader should be a Wol@@ frat@@ sh@@ aus@@ er .
if you want to join the project , do n&apos;t hesitate to contact us .
the different positions in relation to reconstruction will remain in the eyes of Pi@@ ff@@ ls in the near future .
he appreciates Dim@@ bath as a `` mis@@ sionary &apos;&apos; who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two more advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock .
through a high participation of the population and volunteers from all over the world , they are a magnet for tourists .
Pi@@ ff@@ l : `` I too was sceptical at the beginning .
over time , however , I am more and more convinced that it is useful to promote the project : it can be created a `` unique selling &apos;&apos; of the city of Flensburg .
there is nothing other than that .
in addition to this , the project would be financed by EU grants , visitor tickets and potential sponsors that believe Pi@@ ff@@ l .
`` I do n&apos;t really want to throw the idea of reconstruction on board , &apos;&apos; he hopes that the Burg@@ verein might make a difference on this point .
the goal of documenting history first is `` important and good . &apos;&apos;
after that , you could go further .
clever ways to save money in university textbooks
since the cost of translation books for many students is more than $ 1,000 per year , Matt Schroeder &apos;s F@@ ast-@@ second student graduate a clever austerity .
he invented a sur@@ rog@@ acy system for books of students of higher semester and offered nominal compensation to delay the resale .
`` My math book usually costs $ 180 , but I got it for $ 10 for a semester and a Ch@@ ick@@ -@@ fil@@ -@@ A-@@ K@@ eks , `` said Schröder , 19 , who visited the Covenant College in Georgia .
the books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430 , he said .
it accounted for $ 120 .
the division informed that , on average , students spend more than 1,200 dollars a year on textbooks and study material that there would be various cost options for students .
online shops and creative approaches such as the Schro@@ e@@ ders are increasingly the solution to the choice of students .
the rents of textbooks are becoming more popular , and students can use a book for six months , often at a much lower cost than when they are purchased .
Ne@@ ebo Inc , which operates more than 250 university book@@ shops , informed that the rental of text books has doubled since 2011 .
surveys in the industry show that about one quarter of the books in the Columbus book stores had been rented in the last spring spring , said Ne@@ eb@@ os &apos;s Vice-President T@@ ev@@ or Meyer .
less than half of all textbooks are bought according to the National Association of College Store , the National Association of College Stores .
here is the unique one for the best deals .
online Buy
some new books cost only one third of the price for which they are in the camp book .

if one of the notes in other or normal usage tracks does nothing , used books are a good option .
it is necessary to have 9@@ 3.@@ 49 $ at Ch@@ eg@@ g@@ .com .
Matt Cas@@ a@@ day , 25 , final student at Brig@@ ham Young University , says that he has spent 42 C@@ ents on Amazon@@ .com for a used edition of `` Strategic Media Dec@@ ision : Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business .
the book was sold more than 48 dollars .
academics such as Ingrid Bra@@ c@@ ey , director of the University of Massachusetts at Am@@ her@@ st College Without W@@ alls advised students to ask their professors whether previous editions would be admissible .
sometimes the updates to the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue .
in addition to Ch@@ egg and Amazon , Half .com of eBay Inc is a popular alternative to used books .
hire
the rental of textbooks is worth considering , if you treat them reasonably well , they think they can return them and you do n&apos;t want to keep your books at the end of the course .
you can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book .
for example , a student could rent `` around 20 $ for the duration of a semester &apos;&apos; year for the duration of a semester , a student of around 20 , a student for the duration of a semester , a student of around $ 20 , a student for the duration of a semester , a student of around $ 20 , and a student at the age of
inform yourself about the terms of business when you rent , even about the penalties that may result in the writing of notes , discounts or traces of usage .
r@@ enter is fit : if you do not return the book , the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book .
E-@@ Books
E-@@ Books instead of traditional textbooks are an option .
sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a given period of time from wholesalers like Amazon@@ .com , Ch@@ egg , and Bar@@ nes &amp; Nob@@ le Inc. .
at Ch@@ egg , you can rent `` around $ 61 &apos;&apos; for 6 months for 6 months .
Bra@@ c@@ ey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers , since many classics can be downloaded free of charge today , while scientific and professional textbooks can be very expensive .
take a look at each case .
Joe Gault , 29 who will soon be visiting Pep@@ per@@ dine Law School , advises the IS@@ B@@ N number for the pricing of books , since you can be sure that you can find the book you &apos;re looking for .
and before ordering an online order , you should check if the book is actually in stock .
he learned this lesson on the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and paid the full price in the collage book .
why `` Guardi@@ ans of the Galaxy &apos;&apos; has not been a ticket of cash .
`` The Exp@@ end@@ ables 3 &apos;&apos; by Sy@@ lv@@ ester Stall@@ one played less than $ 30 million of his $ 90 million budget in the United States , while `` S@@ in City : a Lady to Kil@@ l For only $ 12 million in his budget of $ 70 million .
the film `` Sex Tap@@ e &apos;&apos; which was tailored to Cameron Di@@ az only performed 14.@@ 6 million dollars on the opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as `` Dragon Hold , &apos;&apos; would also disappoint 2 as well in terms of revenue .
an article of the Telegra@@ ph@@ -@@ film critic Rob@@ bie Coll@@ in suggests that in children &apos;s films the lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves .
in 2014 , Coll@@ in called `` the worst year &apos;&apos; for children &apos;s films , and described `` dra@@ gons made lightly `` 2 &apos;&apos; as purely `` functional &apos;&apos; continuation .
in the case of films for a slightly older target group , it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
in July , Entertainment Weekly compared the average Cinem@@ a@@ Score and Met@@ ac@@ ri@@ tic rating for every summer film that was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and at least 2000 sheets in the year .
the results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year &apos;s film hits are equivalent to those of last year .
some commentators believe that development is due to changing visual habits and growing popularity of web streaming services such as Net@@ fli@@ x .
director Jon F@@ av@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on any of the jungle films that are appearing soon , said to Hollywood Reporter in relation to the website Hollywood Reporter : `` I think times change . &apos;&apos;
we must accept it , and we do not want to try to do so in the past .
in contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions , Net@@ fli@@ x recently generated revenues of $ 1.2 billion , almost twice as much as last year in which turnover amounted to $ 8@@ 37 million .
in the last summer , director Steven Spiel@@ berg criticized the film studios for concentrating on comics of comics and predicting a `` core melting &apos;&apos; of Hollywood .
in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core .
in the summer of 2015 , Age of Ul@@ tron , Min@@ ions and Jur@@ assi@@ c World , other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic .
the producer of X-@@ Men , Simon Kin@@ berg , described the decline in cash results recently as simply `` cyc@@ lic &apos;&apos; and it said to Hollywood reporters : `` The next summer will be the biggest summer on the Kin@@ ok@@ asse at all , and no one will worry about business anymore . &apos;&apos;
when , a couple of years ago , the 2nd place of tennis was removed for the tightening of the league division , it has been a step in the right direction .
now the German Tennis Association has launched an additional 3 Bundesliga in the programme .

however , although it is possible to avoid falling down in the next season , it is still possible to get the best time to go , which means that you will be able to get the best time to go .

NATO Summit : first protests in Newport and Cardiff
on the weekend , there were protests from opponents of the NATO Summit in Newport .
on Saturday , hundreds in the center of Newport gathered into an anti-@@ NATO march .
on Sunday , around 150 people in Cardiff met in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-@@ summit .

after half an hour , the transmitter has restored it again .
P@@ TV director Ath@@ ar Far@@ oo@@ q said that demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged equipment in the editors .
people who were killed or injured were not reported .
the demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the Heads of Government whom they are accused of electoral fraud .
the police told us that around one kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Na@@ wa@@ z Shar@@ if came back on Monday to clashes of around 3000 demonstrators with security forces .
in the case of hospital , a policeman has been injured .
on the weekend , at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to invade Sh@@ ari@@ fs residence .
you are calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister .
on Sunday evening , after a meeting in the army headquarters , the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict to waste time and use it without violence . &apos;&apos;
it was said in the communication : `` The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state . &apos;&apos;
the escalation of violence has fueled concern about intervention by the military , which has , in the past , had a more frequent use of it .
protests led by the opposition politician Im@@ ran Khan and the Pre@@ diger Tah@@ ir@@ ul Qaddafi have lasted since Independence Day on August 14 .
Shar@@ if refuses to resign .
Khan and Qaddafi had called on their supporters on Sunday to play out .
`` We will not decline without forcing Shar@@ if to resign , &apos;&apos; said Khan .
Qaddafi spoke similarly .
Khan repro@@ aches Shar@@ if that the parliamentary election in May last year was won by means of fraud .
Qaddafi demands the resignation of Central and the provincial governments .
then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the government quarter .
the demonstrators had initially had peace in front of Parliament until Khan and Qaddafi called upon them at the weekend to invade Sh@@ ari@@ fs residence .

`` The victory is very liberated , &apos;&apos; said Trainer Z@@ oran Bar@@ is@@ ic , whose team had reached an intermediate head in the Europa League on Thursday .
`` The experience of success was incredibly important , &apos;&apos; Captain and Tor@@ guard confirmed Steff@@ en Hof@@ mann , who came up with green white in the place of three .
Sch@@ ram@@ mel@@ -@@ dream@@ tor has the right response to the disappointment at Helsinki with the second season victory with the second season victory . it has an experience of success in the game of land .
`` We wanted to show a positive reaction , &apos;&apos; said external defenders of Thomas Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el , who set the course for victory with his splendid director Vol@@ ley from the sixth point of view in the 14th .
`` I thought I was listening to all the frustration of Thursday , and I put him under the bar , &apos;&apos; said the 26-@@ year-old smiles .
when Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el met in a Bundes@@ lig@@ ap@@ arti@@ e in 2010 for the last time in 2010 , it was still in front of Ri@@ ed .
the first masterpiece in the Rap@@ id-@@ D@@ ress will therefore remain in special memory .
`` For me , that is something very special , I am out of the rap@@ id-@@ boy , &apos;&apos; said Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el .
as a result of Mario Pa@@ vel@@ ic &apos;s short-term swimming pool of Mario Pa@@ vel@@ ic , Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el moved from the left to the right side of the defensive and made it very well there .
he has enough experience of being able to exercise that position .
the gate is worth it , he has already done some ass@@ ists this year , &apos;&apos; he praised Bar@@ is@@ ic .
team showed character in the direction of Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el , also the flan@@ ks to 2 : 0 carried out by Hof@@ mann after a good one hour that eventually brought the decision .
after all , it would have been possible to write to our guests .
`` Thank you today , we were lucky enough , &apos;&apos; Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el also remarked that the gap in performance and results over the past few weeks had happened : `` The results have not voted , but the playing field has always been good in comparison with last year . &apos;&apos;
Bar@@ is@@ ic even said that `` in many games it was better than today than today - against `` the strongest team that played in this season in this stadium . &apos;&apos;
the first three points since 26 July have therefore proven that the team structure has remained intact in spite of the setbacks : `` Today my team has shown that it has character . &apos;&apos;
for him , it is not so good that we have finally played zero once again . &apos;&apos;
much of the work during country break is also the circumstance that with Brian B@@ utor , Mario Pa@@ vel@@ ic , Christopher Di@@ bon , Den@@ i Al@@ ar and Michael Sch@@ imp@@ els@@ berger are several failures to complain , and Sr@@ d@@ jan Gra@@ ho@@ vac , Stefan St@@ ang@@ l and Philipp Scho@@ bes@@ berger , their debut is more valuable .
`` You must not forget this , &apos;&apos; said Bar@@ is@@ ic , who in the past three days has lost the hands of B@@ ates and Pa@@ vel@@ ic players who have been very stable in recent times .
the session break must therefore be used to tap the wounds and a bit in the physical field , &apos;&apos; Bar@@ is@@ ic , who has five U@@ 21 selections in his ranks , has to be used .
one of the most attractive places to stay is Captain Hof@@ mann .
when it comes to the crew , it goes through pain .
in this difficult phase he showed that he is a very important player for us , &apos;&apos; Bar@@ is@@ ic said .
Hof@@ mann gave the game of Rap@@ ids before his confusion in the 6@@ 8th minute not only the structure , but also the second door .
since 2 November 2013 -LRB- 4 : 2 on the admir@@ a -RRB- , it was the first match for the 33-@@ year-old who completed his 350 .
Hof@@ mann : `` must not believe that now everything is good &apos;&apos; `` We have certainly had a bit of luck , but at some point luck has to come back to us .
now it was high time , &apos;&apos; Hof@@ mann said .
he warned , of course , a concentration of concentration : `` It is not always possible to see it in black and white .
over the past few weeks , we have not been so badly played as it has been presented .
however , we must not believe that everything is now good .
he was unable to dispute the importance of his role to the team .
it is a very young team which I can help at the moment .
some of them believe in me , &apos;&apos; Hof@@ mann said .
Grö@@ dig@@ -@@ Coach Michael Ba@@ ur had little to accuse his team .
he expressed regret about the fast opposition `` from the category of magic , &apos;&apos; as well as the regular gateway of N@@ utz in the 40 minute , which was wrongly recognized by arbitr@@ ators .
the only accusation I can make is that we have not been sufficiently concrete in the direction of Tor in a number of stages .
we have had too few qualifications .
interior defence of Maximilian Kar@@ ner saw it in a similar way : `` It has started immediately , but then we found it completely and even made a gate .
in general , more would have been in place .

in the meantime , the sector has regained its meaning , since in the meadows it is actually home to goat herds .
the area has also been declared part of the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve , and Schneider has made use of it .

Ren@@ zi , like the French newspaper , La Repubblica , sees the appeal of his Mo@@ gher@@ ini in the government team as well , as the European Social Democrats &apos; position and its own in the EU .
he also expects a boost for his `` reform package &apos;&apos; in Italy .
last but not least , Ren@@ zi hopes to make sure that the left party base against him continues to be raised against him , because Mo@@ gher@@ ini is associated with it , albeit in a more moderate manner .
with regard to the conservative representatives with the President of the Commission , Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland , who , as President-in-Office of the Council , nominated Poland Donald Tus@@ k , the prevailing view in Rome is to make a political settlement .
after all , the EU &apos;s chief diplomat will be the Deputy President of the President of the Commission , Juncker .
the approval of the European Parliament that has yet to be approved is safe .
otherwise , President Giorgio Napolitano would not have described the nomination of the 4@@ 1@@ year politician of the ruling Democratic Party -LRB- PD -RRB- as a `` important recognition &apos;&apos; of Italy &apos;s role in the EU .
la Repubblica optimism is that for nearly two decades it has been possible to show up to the `` enormous challenges &apos;&apos; in leading party offices .
the native Roman is married and has two daughters .
her party career began in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then Democ@@ rati@@ ci di Sin@@ is@@ tra -LRB- Lef@@ t-@@ Democrats -RRB- , which in 2008 merged with the Catholic Center Party , Margherita , to join today &apos;s Social Democrat PD .
in 1999 , Mo@@ gher@@ ini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth -LRB- European Young Soci@@ alists -RRB- .
with the election in 2001 in the party council of the left-wing Democrats , they rose to the high party politics , where they worked in foreign policy , of which they became their leaders soon .
it has been known as the Middle East , it has been known as NATO in Afghanistan , where Italy is involved in a troop quota , and contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and Democrats in the United States were attached .
since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Dep@@ uties , in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs .
when Ren@@ zi became Prime Minister in February 2014 , he called Mo@@ gher@@ ini his Secretary of State .
if the PD has today once again a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country , which contributed to over 40 % of the party &apos;s votes in the EU elections in May , then , as it says in P@@ D-@@ circles , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini has a share of it .
the recruitment in Brussels , which has too little diplomatic experience in Brussels , that is , therefore , a lack of substance , is being mastered in the PD .
in Brussels , in particular by Poland and the Baltic States , realistic accents about the crisis in Ukraine are being persecuted and diff@@ used as a `` anti-@@ rural course . &apos;&apos;
it endorses the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian firm , South Stream , which is intended to transport Russian natural gas directly to southern Europe , byp@@ assing Ukraine directly to southern Europe , which also serves to serve Italy &apos;s energy security .
when Ren@@ zi began his term as a member of the EU in July , Mo@@ gher@@ ini traveled to Moscow for her first visit to Moscow .
photos , which they showed with Putin at the Sha@@ ke-@@ Hand , were greeted with indignation in Brussels , as the Kremlin leader in October invited the Kremlin to join a meeting of Milan .

the Socialists in France should `` hold the mouth and put France in order , &apos;&apos; said the most important ally of Francois Hollande .
Mr V@@ alls called on the deeply divided left to show `` their love &apos;&apos; for the controversial socialist president , whose cabinet building has come up against disapproval by the vast majority of the French .

`` and the new will not survive the autumn or winter , &apos;&apos; he said that Le Pen said to supporters of supporters .
she reiterated her party &apos;s call for a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that he would come out in favour of pre-@@ elections and that she was prepared for government .
France &apos;s ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was represented in the EU elections in May .

pro-@@ Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision .
a p@@ ek@@ ing@@ loyal group drew the Chinese flag close to the Chinese flag .
on Sunday , the Standing Committee of the National People &apos;s Congress adopted a framework law which only allows for only two or three candidates for the election in Hong Kong in 2017 .
all the candidates must first reach the majority support of a Nom@@ ination Committee , which is likely to be filled with greedy members .
by means of this decision , opposition Democrats will be almost impossible to be allowed to vote and has led pro-@@ democracy activists to make up for their threat and to paraly@@ se Hong Kong &apos;s financial headquarters with `` Occup@@ y Central &apos;&apos; protests .
political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong ; and China &apos;s party leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities .
after the publication of a Beijing White Paper , which set out in June China &apos;s dominance of Hong Kong , pro-@@ democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region , in which hundreds of thousands of thousands of people in the city &apos;s business district invaded the city and organized a sit@@ -in there .

until the end of the year , Britain had no democratic elements in Hong Kong until the end of the 150 years of colonial government in Hong Kong .
Putin calls on Kiev to include a `` state of state &apos;&apos; with the O@@ stu@@ kra@@ ze .
Russian President Vladimir Putin , according to Russian media reports , said on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government will abandon the struggles against the separ@@ ati@@ sts in the East of the country and immediately accept negotiations on `` statehood &apos;&apos; of the break@@ away region .
his spokesman , Dimit@@ ri Pes@@ kov , subsequently made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of the O@@ stu@@ kra@@ ze region will become a part of Russia under control of the separatist area under control , but that its status with regard to Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian-@@ speaking region the power of representation of its rights and interests .
however , Putin &apos;s appeal to the Kiev government on negotiations on equals with the pro-@@ Russian insurgents , does fit for the strategy that has appeared from him since the beginning of the riots in five months , namely aid for the separ@@ ati@@ sts in the opening of areas and on the pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region No@@ vor@@ o@@ ssi@@ ja region for a alliance with
in an interview with the state television channel Channel One , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the re@@ conquest of areas in the eastern regions of Don@@ ez@@ k and Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k , which had been held in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March .
in recent times , the Kremlin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have described the territory taken as `` No@@ vor@@ o@@ ssi@@ ja &apos;&apos; or New Russia , a term that recalls the pre-@@ revolutionary shining times of the Russian Empire .
Putin pointed out that all those who , in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians , are in favour of the elections on the 26th , and while government groups in civilian communities in the areas that it has held in the areas held by separ@@ ati@@ sts , are caught up in illusions in anticipation of peace talks , &apos;&apos; said I@@ tar@@ -T@@ ass .
`` We need to start talking immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the status of the state status of the South-East Asia to protect the interests of the people who live there , &apos;&apos; he said .
Pes@@ kov said that Putin &apos;s reference to statehood must be seen in the context with greater autonomy that has been discussed since months from the Kiev leadership of leadership to dispel fears in Russian-@@ speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened .
only the Ukrainian Government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas , said Pes@@ kov .
it is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , as Pes@@ kov said `` because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal conflict in Ukraine . &apos;&apos;
the Kremlin &apos;s clarification about the correction of the `` mis@@ interpretation &apos;&apos; of Putin was underlined by Russia &apos;s leaders in the handling of the separatist rebellion in the East , in contrast with the direct rise of Crimea , which is the majority of the 2 million inhabitants of ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annex@@ ing the regions of Don@@ et@@ sk and Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k , the majority of the population of 6.5 million , since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and showed a broad majority in advance of the dispute before the conflict in Ukraine .
the autonomy raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would give authority to regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate own trade agreements and external relations , and to give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that links the Russian territory with Crimea .
the peninsula in the Black Sea , which was annexed five months ago , is a port port for the majority of the Russian Navy , as well as an important commercial and historical coastal region .
the regions between the mountains in Russia and Crimea are rich in mines , factories and found@@ ries that produce important components for the Russian military .
in his speech on the inauguration on 7 June , the Ukrainian President Pet@@ ro Por@@ o@@ shenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislation should consider , after new elections , amendments to the Constitution with which the relevant areas are given greater control over their finances and the status of languages .
but his vision of autonomy seems to be sharply opposed to the Kremlin and the separatist rebels , who are accused of armament and incitement to Moscow .
Putin &apos;s last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on a par with equals was followed by last week &apos;s insistence on the rebels in last week , after Russian troops and tanks began to enter the eastern coast into the O@@ stu@@ kra@@ an Sea .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts supported by Russia , according to fears of Ukrainian security officials , took over the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea , the control of No@@ wo@@ as@@ ov@@ sk .
for this reason , massive civil and military preparations have begun to support Mari@@ u@@ pol , a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants which lies between No@@ wo@@ as@@ ov@@ sk and narrow access to the Crimea peninsula .
Por@@ o@@ shenko referred to a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
`` We are close to a point where there is no return , &apos;&apos; Por@@ o@@ shenko warned .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine .
the EU summit decided not to take specific action ; the leadership called for further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in an un@@ specified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in I@@ lo@@ wa@@ j@@ sk after two Russian tanks of tanks and 1,000 soldiers last week joined the Don@@ et@@ ov region to support the besieg@@ ed separ@@ ati@@ sts , Colonel Andri@@ j Ly@@ sen@@ ko , spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security Council , said it was in Kiev on Saturday .
the first , 63 Ukrainian soldiers , who were trapped by the Russian case in I@@ lo@@ wa@@ j@@ sk , were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parach@@ uti@@ sts who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago , Ly@@ sen@@ ko informed on Sunday .
nu@@ t@@ foto@@ scandal about Australian Pro@@ mis and Gab@@ i Gre@@ ck@@ o
Ge@@ off@@ rey Edel@@ sten made no bones about his trouble about hackers , who had probably stolen naked images of his patron Gab@@ i Gre@@ ck@@ o and a Who Who has stolen the A-@@ Pro@@ mis from Hollywood .
the film city is in excitement , after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence has appeared in a hacking scandal about pro@@ mis on the Internet .
the hackers who are responsible for this have over 60 naked photos from Lawrence , Star of `` Tri@@ bute of pan@@ em &apos;&apos; and super@@ stars among them , including the models Kate U@@ pt@@ on and Car@@ a Del@@ ev@@ ing@@ ne , the singers of R@@ ih@@ anna , Ari@@ ana Grande and Le@@ a Michelle , and the actress Kir@@ sten Dun@@ st .
from the Australian act@@ resses Teresa Pal@@ mer , Emil@@ y Bro@@ wning , Yvonne Stra@@ ho@@ v@@ sky , and Gre@@ ck@@ o from Melbourne , private photos were allegedly made public on the basis of an i@@ jac@@ u@@ lic compound .
on the list are 101 Pro@@ mis .
most of those who died with Gre@@ ck@@ o last month said , `` It is disgu@@ sting . &apos;&apos;
all private letters and images should remain private .
it is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and transmitted to others .
Gre@@ ck@@ o , at the time in New York , said according to reports that a news website said that the h@@ ack was `` shameful , &apos;&apos; and that those affected felt `` injured . &apos;&apos;
the h@@ acker has probably 30 pictures of Pal@@ mer with its ex-@@ friend Scott Speed@@ man , including two pictures in which they are at the top of the pool .
the film works of Pal@@ mers belong to `` Love which is inv@@ inci@@ ble with Li@@ am Hem@@ s@@ worth .
Pal@@ mer , Chu@@ ck-@@ Star Stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and the actress Bro@@ wning from Su@@ cker P@@ unch were not available yesterday for comments about the hack@@ ed images .
a representative of Lawrence &apos; said to TM@@ Z : `` It is an outrageous violation of privacy . &apos;&apos;
actor Se@@ th Ro@@ gen condemned the h@@ acker in his twe@@ et : `` hack@@ ed images from a mobile phone is nothing other than the sale of H@@ eh@@ ler@@ ware . &apos;&apos;
from a purely legal point of view , the images that have been passed on should not be tolerated .
today , Rad@@ ler , Jog@@ gers and hikers were supported by the `` Help of Cre@@ bs &apos;&apos; Children yesterday at the 8th wheel on the Great Feld@@ berg mountain range .
the tour , which was one of them , turned out to be a slight training for the other .
everyone agreed , however : it has been fun .
Thomas Stu@@ dan@@ ski may have slept well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of Ober@@ ur@@ sel@@ er Brau@@ haus took place yesterday with the wheel on Feld@@ berg .
for the good purpose .
he can be easily removed from the small muscle muscles , especially since he has personally brought a valuable insight into the participation on the 8th of the Rad@@ es on the Main Feld@@ berg in favour of the association `` Help for Cre@@ b@@ sk@@ ents Children &apos;&apos; -LRB- Frankfurt -RRB- .
it is a great thing .
`` I know now that I can - I can do it ! &apos;&apos;
small patches on the move move in the applause curve ?
if I had stopped , snow , if I had stopped , had been out of that .
like Thomas Stu@@ dan@@ ski , who is sitting in the Ober@@ ur@@ sel@@ er City Council in Upper Austria , many of the 7@@ 18 participants ra@@ ced yesterday in the early valleys of mountains and came close to exhaustion , although happy on the plateau .
on the other hand , it was easier to overcome the good eleven kilometre stretch between Hoh@@ emark and Feld@@ berg .
Norman Die@@ ß@@ ner for example .
if you do n&apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for , you will get the best of your choice , but you will get more to do with it .
he has also taken the route through a slide , as well as Nina Kuhn , press officer in the city of Ober@@ ur@@ sel , who , together with Frank Grün@@ eisen , had decided to follow the course .
for the two tri@@ athlon athletes , the `` Feld@@ berg@@ -R@@ ad@@ eln &apos;&apos; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : `` It is a question of Char@@ ity , we are happy to have an exit - we would have done anyway today , &apos;&apos; as Kuhn said .
on the move , Paul Wenz@@ el met Paul Wenz@@ el from Ober@@ rei@@ fen@@ berg .
the boy -LRB- 12 -RRB- had gone down to Ober@@ ur@@ sel in the morning to beat the height of it again .
in the morning at 9 am at home in the saddle , the Frankfurt Florian decor@@ ator had turned the field two times to roll with fun at home .
it was also fun to have `` Fr@@ itt@@ en-@@ Toni . &apos;&apos;
for the head of Ober@@ ur@@ sel@@ er cult kios@@ ks , bike tours via Feld@@ berg are easy to reach .
he had entered 40 minutes with his 6.@@ 5-@@ kilo@@ rac@@ e-@@ wheel .
it is a crazy event .
for this purpose , I am happy to say , `` Andreas Balz@@ ke said .
Main@@ zer , who has been trained , says that he is a `` more ambitious racing bike . &apos;&apos;
that is what it needs to be , because he was travelling with the `` fixed track &apos;&apos; , it is also racing bikes , but without a circuit it was also possible .
that it was also easy to climb up without wheel , it proved not only the 20 hikers who climbed up over the White Wall to the summit , but also a Jog@@ ger who , at a K@@ ord@@ el , had a licence with weights behind her .
he said : `` I am sure that you will get the best time to go .
the 7@@ 18 participants - and thus so many people as never before - had been sent into groups in the morning .
the trek@@ kers first start at 9.30 a.m
it was followed by the first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m
five minutes later , the first mountain bikers came out .
bent Hansen , chairman of the association `` Rad@@ eln on the Great Feld@@ berg , &apos;&apos; gave the starting command and wanted the participants to take a nice trip .
next year , he hopes that it will succeed in closing the route to Feld@@ berg to secure the safety of the participants .
