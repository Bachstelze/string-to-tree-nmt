Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just that.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about policy measures in the Middle East.
The meeting is also intended to meet the conflict with the Palestinians and the negotiations that have been discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing violence and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The relationship of the two has continued to deteriorate by the Obama administration of Iran's nuclear program.
In March, at the invitation of Republicans, Netanyahu held a controversial talk before the US Congress that was partly considered to be an issue against Obama.
There was no mention of Obama with Obama, and a meeting was rejected with reference to the imminent election in Israel.
In one of them, Professor admits that he has shot his girlfriend.
In one case, Professor Shannon Lamb told a little to the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house.
It was important to emphasise that his/live dog while he was still alive, and he said the death of the dead could be found on the mobile phone.
Inside the house, officials found the money of Amy and a note that was on a white block: I wanted to reverse it, I wanted to reverse it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved it.
ES gave no hint that Lamb, who traveled in two for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to where, according to the police, he shot and killed one of the most popular, reports of the police, at the door to his office.
Delta State University said that he heard about it at 10: 18 pm.
He said that Lamb eventually made it to him after that.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life when the police took him him.
One day after the university that forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details of what was published at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him did, helped to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said that they were taking part in his classes.
The police said that when he died, he said he had no history of violence or a criminal background.
Schmidt himself mentioned lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the wonderful people with whom he shared his life.
Both included in the Social Sciences and History Department, whose members include 17 members, and many students visited courses of both.
At the same time, there have been some inclinations about problematic behaviour.
A student, a couple of people who used the Lamb, said he also seemed a little bit to himself as to whether he was wrong.
Another student, working money, said that Lamm told him that at the end of the year he had to deal with stress at the end of the year.
Previously, the Delta State University had asked for a fee for health reasons, saying that it has any problem.
This year it is only two.
Recent changes in the employment policy of the University that the promotion for which the Lamb worked so hard would not constitute a guarantee for him, that it would be an automatic route to a job.
He said that he had nothing to say about a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but there was, of course, something in Mr Solana's idea.
These are questions that lamb can no longer answer.
After the flight from the campus, the police later found a track when it was again imported into Mississippi.
Before he was able to be detained, Lamb of a house, a mere mile south of a house in the backyard of a house, said that on the outskirts of the town of Oakland, Mississippi, Washington County said he was Johnson Johnson.
His car was still in the entrance.
ES was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
It was growing in the area.
It began in 2009 its work at the University, which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000 inhabitants, making geography and culture available.
He received his doctorate in spring.
One of the longstanding friends of friends described it as intelligent, funny and funny.
Carla said she was 15, and Lamb was 20 when they met by shared friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older person who tried several years.
He was the same at that time.
All girls involved when he was one of them, one who said it was 40, and the Jackson who was one of those who took part in it.
There seems to have been some time together on the part of both sides.
In the caretaker said Lamb said I have killed my wife, but there was no document from a marriage.
They had a dog called the one who lived with them with them, which came to one of them in a place where they were able to use them.
The police said that the dog was fine.
The person who spent 15 years in prison said they were friends, but they had friends who had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
When she was totally destroyed on the ground, he said he was talking about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
He said he had never met Lamb, but his daughter told him that he was interested in music and played the blues.
When he was three years ago, he met both of them when he was three years ago when he was three years ago when he was one of the two.
Later on, they played together one or other.
He said his daughter wrote, and sings her own music.
It was one that worked online for various companies.
Mike who, in a poorly lit bar near the room, said that he saw lamb and the night in the night of 5 September, said that he had finished lamb and the night of 5 September during the night of 5 September when lamb ended before a public audience.
There was no sign that something was wrong.
Just make a happy pair, he said.
We have been with each other on both sides.
I think they have both made a good sense for them.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the estate and specialized in American indigenous people and colonial history, saying Don Allan Mitchell, a woman at school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at the State University of Kansas, Kansas, and was president of his family.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people took part on Tuesday evening, including faculty, staff, students, and members of the community on a regular basis.
Wife and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also took part in the final stage, while the home sang Star of America and Department of Dependent Grace.
The course will be resumed on Wednesday.
Let us try to move our students in order to move home, he said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and she reported stories from Cleveland, Mississippi.
This report contributed to this report by publishing authors of press authors in New Orleans, Mississippi, and New Orleans, a number of authors who have contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to tell that the police now says that Lamb made the land after he shot Schmidt, and that lamb in his country called him as his wife, but there is no hint of the two ever having that.
Toys R Us, less labor for the people to hire
Toys R Us say that it will not be as many as last year as it is in the last year, but it tells us that it will give employees who are currently working with him, giving them a chance to work more hours of work.
The company has said that it is planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and markets throughout the country.
Most jobs will be a thing.
The company said that this month will start with a start and that it will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the business moves closer, and companies are preparing to hire them in order to equip shops with employees who sell, ship and produce products.
Michael J. Fox on his date with Princess Diana
The premiere of the career back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
We have been sitting in the theatre waiting for the, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it will gradually make it clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me, he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary going back to time.
The film begins, and it seems to me to me that I am one of them and I am away from being with the Princess of Wales when it comes to a date.
Back in Time, a documentary about going to the Future Back to the Future, presents interviews with Fox, VP Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, along with director Robert and the producer Steven.
Back for the Future had its premiere 30 years ago.
For me it is really something I really want to know, saying it was the biggest one that has ever been shot.
Return Back in Time will be seen on DVD and selected cinemas in October.
It says 'there is no military solution in good
Secretary-General Ban says his answer to Russia's response is to Russia: It does not provide a military solution to nearly five years of conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The latter once again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and to support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the Council's five permanent - United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France - on the margins of this month's General Assembly in order to discuss the situation in a few days.
He said that the people of the Council and the people of Syria would make use of this situation.
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated when they reached a nuclear deal with Iran when dealing with the crisis.
8 of them showing that Donald is serious to take seriously.
Some have tried to use it as a means of getting rid of them.
Others dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to drag Donald from the top of polls below, it does not work anymore.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald in the area of concern, and some are beginning to think seriously about what it means for the chances of nominating that.
Of course, it is still too early in office.
No one claims that it is likely that they will win the award.
Experts point out that at that time Rick led Rick in 2011 in 2011, with no one winning a state at the same time.
And there are many reasons why he would have to contend in a general election.
But, like Bush's super, and conservative, club for Growth, as well as the conservative club for Growth, and the conservative club for Growth, will begin to move its dollar to bring it into force.
Here are some current issues, which suggest that it is not just a temporary phase.
Two of them have been shot at 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald gave his candidacy in mid-June, a survey showed that only two out of ten saw it as positive.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 have a positive view of Donald.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
Last week, in Iowa, there was a good view of 60% of Republicans.
Two-thirds of the total would be happy with candidates as candidates.
In a survey by CNN last week, 67 percent of Republicans said, they were either enthusiastic about either or they were happy about it when they were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be angry if he were the candidate.
Only Ben who has the same enthusiasm as about 43% of her enthusiasm say they would be impressed by only 40 percent, which would say the same thing about the same.
The next in enthusiasm?
Marco with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they would be unhappy with either who are unhappy or are angry if Bush, the man of the bargain, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see a problem as a problem.
While Donald is widely criticized for his/her words, 52% of Irish voters believe that the right is the right one for a president, according to ABC News, Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies to the first person of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52% of Republicans believe that he has personality for one, according to last week.
Nevertheless, 44% that he does not have the personality to carry out his office effectively, and almost six of us say that he does not fit into the White House, like ABC.
Voters are getting used to the idea.
If they do their best, Republican voters consider it to be real.
If they are asked who is most likely to win the race, four out of ten say that last week, four out of ten say that is the best bet.
This has been a change since the time when four out of ten in the end of July put their money on Bush.
Total disclosure: In the past there was no such thing as the one that had been used in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, four out of ten thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Romney.
However, it is clear that a large number of people involved in the campaign regard it as being able to take advantage of it.
Even if the Republicans have gathered for another candidate, he still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the field probably contributes to the leadership's leadership.
But a survey of the day at the beginning of September shows that in one that has a relationship between the most and most other republican candidates, the aid is collected by means of support.
He has 13 points in advance, 14 points before Marco, and 15 points before the Bush, and finally Paul, John and Chris, 33 points.
ES is one of the most famous in the world.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a race.
A majority of people say that they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support them say they have won their votes.
Of course, much action can be taken to change this, and nobody can really say that they never change.
46% said that they leave the door open to move to other candidates.
Nevertheless, the most powerful competitor at the moment of another, the Ben, is Ben, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent as they are.
Six out of 10 say that they are consistent with the issue of immigration.
When Donald, who two months ago called immigrants from Mexico, called an immigrant from Mexico, immigration was the hub of public discourse in 2016.
Some people are concerned that the combination of crucial issues that can be used by the party will damage the party and damage the land.
But after the new ABC of Monday, six out of 10 say that they are compatible with issues of immigration.
So, as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald will appear to do so.
Frustration with the government based on new ones.
In the meantime, about half of the support of Republican voters is dropped to Donald and to Ben, especially through her work.
Six of 10 people in the new ABC say they would prefer to have a political model than someone.
And they are infuriated to Washington.
A survey of the event in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent dissatisfied and 21 percent of business.
Munich, Germany: The five most exclusive parts of Germany.
Here is the residential development of the residential area with a view of the countryside.
In the street it costs a square meter of an average on average Euro.
The offer of objects by nature is limited, so it is limited to the study, which is why it is a high price.
A new study shows in which particular locations of one square meter cost the most.
Of course, Euro Euro per square metre for a match in Munich is not really limited.
Unlike in Germany, one of the prizes comes like.
The angel & woman, who has performed a ranking of the most exclusive German brands in Germany, has a ranking at heights of altitude.
There are tens of thousands of Euro - per square meter, please note.
But it is good who can afford it.
By the way: For once, Munich is not at the top.
League of the Champions League, thanks to Müller and the United States of America
What is more, Thomas Müller simply has a race.
A happy match by Thomas Müller in Germany went on track to a well deserved 3: 0 ran out of money - then it ran out.
A sovereign prelude to the people.
The world champions, Thomas Müller and Mario, have brought a new lease of life to the FC Bayern into the mission of Milan.
The team of coach also won her in the Champions League with the greasy atmosphere due to the Greek in hot atmosphere thanks to the volume of the match they received and the number of matches: 3: 0 - 0 - 0 is earned by 3: 0.
The series in series is said to be the first step towards the final of 28 May 2016 in Italy, where it will finally be possible to get to Munich in the third attempt at the third attempt.
Müller received a score of 28 in the Champions League to help him make use of Roberto, who was one of the first to be shot to death by her, and one of them.
What we wo will not underestimate them, Philipp had promised before the match in front of the match they are playing - and the Munich held the floor.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance, with no need to take advantage of it.
He has won the most recent six of his in his last six years, among them, against renowned clubs like Manchester United, Madrid, or Turin.
In 2011, there is also a limit of 1: 3 for the event in Dortmund.
But Bavaria, seven with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously ran, but they often went to work in their efforts.
The attacks have too often been initiated by means of Douglas Costa of Greece, Douglas Costa.
Müller had more luck from right than his right in the upper left of the upper right.
The third minute of World Champion is the possible 2: 0.
The best opportunities in half had Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, as a producer of mine, the Polish beat the country of Poland from the line 26.
Then by means of one, which is Roberto with his knee 35.
Although Bavaria played its usual role in play, it was possible to place a lot of money on it.
But this was something that was good for Manuel New.
So, for example, when he shot a shot of a shot above the bar 56/56.
In front of New, one of the first to defend it with David in the center was defending in addition to defending a good that made it good.
Mario who was first sitting outside, after problems with problems, was first sitting outside.
Only after giving the green light, the former gave the green light: Matthias said that it would be possible for them to have something different from that, and that is something that is already something to do with it.
When he was first changing, he opted against him when he brought out more than 59% of his life.
It came late in time when it came to office, and 13 minutes later it was clear that it was still on top of it.
In front of the match it was in the stadium.
After a smaller group of people who were sometimes involved in the project seemed to provoke the supporters of hosts with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and introduced them against the followers of Munich.
At least one was taken from the stadium.
Anyone who uses them has a higher risk of losing teeth.
Anyone who is taking advantage of this will harm not only the lung, but also the teeth - that is what Potsdamer Platz suggests.
The good news is that if you do not reduce the risk.
Smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth prematurely.
This is the result of the presence of an international community, several of which are employees of the German Institute for Operations, which is based in Potsdam.
Compared to the risk of losing their teeth prematurely, the risk of losing its teeth prematurely was higher.
The scientists had watched more than participants.
The main causes of concern for and those that have been used as a result of this is emphasised by the fact that it is one of the main causes of the problem.
For this it is smoking, emphasize the authors.
Therefore, the link between smoking and smoking goes back to the point of departure when it comes to housing.
It is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of growth.
People who use smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, writing the researchers in the journal of Dental Research.
However, ES can take more than ten years before it is again up to the level of business, declaring Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
If you want to convince people to become a non-smoking, you have to tell people what they say.
It is good not to smoke, it is good for the lungs and people, and according to our findings it also leads to a good old age.
In Germany, more than 20% of the population of age 65 to 74 have been affected by disease.
Earlier studies would have pointed out that smoking represents the risk of early payment.
This is the new kind of new product that has become a reality.
In Cologne, there are a number of people who live in Cologne.
On the right side of the road there was a discovery of finds on the right in Cologne.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new have, said the volume of the building and the remains of historical buildings, said Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the start of the construction of the Rhine, historians are looking for so-called" 
For all building projects in Cologne, the museum is always considered to be one of the most popular for people who use it.
In the third edition of the race, they found their way.
Although it was already known that there was a fortress and a church in the 4th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the fortress and the castle, there was also a cemetery with about 350 people who belonged to the church.
Young Woman of Relativity
After a young woman is in service at the train station, the population asks for help.
At the beginning of the event, at the end of the day, the woman was taken by the woman from the end of the day, and was captured by one who came from direction.
By capturing the train, it is worn according to most severe injuries.
She was treated on the spot and was brought to a hospital by her.
There is no evidence on the grounds of young women's night clubs.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses, or they have heard some of them.
It is possible to take advantage of this, as it is possible to take advantage of this when it comes to working with people who want to take part.
Notes which provide information about the cause of the accident can be given around the clock and the free hotline of the people under telephone or any other individual.
The EU Commission is arguing in favour of new court of new court.
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current state of affairs in order to ensure that the transatlantic free trade agreement that is planned is taken into account.
The controversial private trade in disputes between companies and states is therefore to be replaced by a system that is more traditional than usual in the way it works.
What we want is for us to establish a system to which people trust them, the responsible explained Cecilia Malmström at the idea.
The latter intends to present the proposal as a European negotiating position with regard to the USA.
The German Government announced its support.
It is intended to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
In concrete terms, the plans for reforming the current budget are that the EU states and the US should jointly select independent judges for a new one.
They should come from the EU, from the United States and from third countries.
For the first time, there is also a second instance of this.
It would allow us to object to judgments.
So far, they have agreed to referees to referees, and their sentences have not been taken against them.
In the discussion of the last few months, it has become clear that citizens do not have the old in terms of fairness and justice.
In the long term, it wants to work towards an international partnership according to its own specifications.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be resolved.
As one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe, they are considered as one of the main reasons for the great resistance that has been made in Europe.
Traditional ones are criticized by opponents as a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind that can claim compensation to companies at the expense of taxpayers, national laws or a reduction of domestic and environmental standards.
In the first statements, the proposals of the EU Commission were described as inadequate in the form of proposals by the European Commission.
Most of all criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada.
The German partner, Matthias, described the plans as great progress, on the other hand.
The Commission has made significant points in the reform of reform, which has been prepared with other measures by Gabriel in spring, Mr Gabriel.
The old system of private use is from the table.
The French Government also welcomed Mrs Malmström's plans.
The European consumer warned against restricting the economics of the economy by too many new rules.
Particular small and medium-sized enterprises could be penalised if they were to be penalised.
When talks on the free trade agreement can conclude Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, it remains unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been going on since the middle of 2013.
But the issue has not been discussed with the United States until now.
Firstly, a framework for the agreement should be in place by the end of this year.
This deadline is no longer valid.
Folk of Art Stevens in Hamburg (Germany)
Eleven years ago, Eugen Stevens on stage at the Cologne Prime Club, today, is sitting on the stage of Luxor.
In addition to this, there is one that has recorded a shy and timid approach to the picturesque city of Michigan.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens talk.
He tells us about various places that he repeatedly reports on the map of events that he/she is talking about.
Where they were born and how it looks in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be wonderfully creative.
With the release of the Great Lake State released in 2003, the Great Lake State recorded songs that can be perfectly suited to American folk at late last years but at any time.
ES comes from the rumour, Michigan would be the first part of a series: Each of the 50 should become one of them.
But already in 2004 and in Germany, Seven of Nine has already appeared and is expecting a certain degree of expectation.
What has been reduced is Stevens here.
It is possible for him to meet him live.
A year later, the musician who lives in Germany returns to the series.
With Illinois of Illinois, Department of Things You To, come on Feel The Way which appears in 2005, this is a masterpiece of art.
A combination of ideas and a point of view.
The album is rising to the American charts and does not lack any of the influential figures that it has.
After experimenting with extremely productive experiments, Stevens then makes use of a very large electronic format on the age of the age of now available 2010, which is one of the largest in the world.
This sixth ordinary course is still broad, but it is worn by sequences of sequences or beats with a lot of effect and hall.
For a long time, the smaller clubs will become the colourful spectacle of large and large numbers of people.
Currently, Stevens Stevens is part of a band by Germany.
In the sale of more in Hamburg, Germany.
Since March, the theatre presents the most popular since March, which is now available since March.
Although there are now nearly 2,000 guests sitting in their seats, the much more widely used Stevens returns to the folk and the folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays by the broad album of music.
You hear from the audience: The talk is something you can talk about.
Only when Stevens was humble, he played few older songs, and eventually became one of them.
Jeremy Fisl-debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since he was elected, he has eagerly anticipated his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
The new Jeremy is going to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and is going to enter David Cameron for the first time.
Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President, Mr President
He demanded fewer theaters and more facts during this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip certain meetings in order to leave them to their colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr President, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the project and his speech on Tuesday on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the person to remain silent on Tuesday during the trip to the 75 th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, and provoke criticism of a number of people has been provoked and is at the heart of a number of articles in the newspapers.
Mr President' s decision not to sing has attracted attention to itself.
A spokesman for Mr said he would have been able to admit himself in silence, and he acknowledged the Royal Air Force as part of the Royal Air Force in England.
But a member of Mr President, Owen Smith, said on BBC Two that he got to the end of singing what he said, independent of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of them have refused to serve as leaders in Mr, and they claim that they have a difference in the economy, defence, and foreign policy, while less than one of the parties of the parliamentary party initially supported it as a leader.
The political question of the BBC Robin states that political differences can also be won within Labour within Labour, according to the statements made by Mr Frattini on the position of the European Union and the limit.
Mr Berman said that Labour was taking part in the idea of removing the whole idea of a limit as a whole.
Hours later, Mr Smith, who said the party was very clear, said that she was only opposed to the idea to reduce the limit of ££to ££.
Mr President, it will be the fifth that David Cameron stands for over the last decade of what is happening in Parliament.
The one who promised another says that he has had ideas about issues for questions to Mr Cameron, and that he has given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The North MP has said that Question Time by the Prime Minister is too good, and that it will refrain from both the need for a reduction in the number of people who are involved in the fight against poverty, and has done instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Mr Berman said that if Angela is not taking part, for example, when Mr Cameron is on the move abroad, Angela will stand up for the shadow of him if he is not taking part.
He also initiated the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the floor, and that he has raised John, the spokesman for the good, in order to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of what was often linked to the Prime Minister's question, but a few years later he acknowledged that he failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was viewed as the main barometer of a leader's judgment, and his position in the House of Commons, although critics have argued that they have become a sort of action and far-reaching reforms.
Aerial shots in public': Young people who are trained for photographers.

But a group of former professionals has found a way to learn one and earn a living.
What I think is one of the most interesting things to do, I know what it is when it comes to life. It is a studio that teaches young people how to take photos from their surroundings and make a profit.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Sterling is rising as a result of United Kingdom's
The pound rose according to data that indicate an increase in UK domestic air, while the 100 was increased by means of the latter.
Between May and July, the result grew by 2.9% without bonuses in the United Kingdom.
Since 2009, this percentage has been the fastest and most accurate assessments of the time of a project.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $- and was up to 3% against the euro at €€.
The 100 index closed with an increase of a 2% increase in volume.
It was one of the most prestigious shares on the market and made a leap of 20% after rival AB had responded to it.
One would combine the two largest in the world, bringing together brands like Budweiser, Stella, etc.

Sport in sport rose by 3.1% after it was reported to have been reported by millions of people for the first half of the year.
The boss of sport says that higher wages threaten expansion.
The manager of the company says that a higher minimum wage could mean more purchasing power in the potential clients" pockets.
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the increased labor costs of his company, so he says.
The costs could be taken by those who make use of sport, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Mix of people in the capital: Berlin in Berlin
It is a question of a situation in which there is a situation in which there is a situation in which it is used.
It is 21 years of age that is young and old.
The type with the hair is 100 million euro hard.
Even more so.
At present, it is Berlin which is based in Berlin.
And the generation is spinning through.
What is the case with regard to the situation?
The company has never heard of the name that we have ever heard about the Carlton Carlton.
It is not something that is going to happen.
Hundreds of fans yesterday.
Amongst them, Polish and Polish.
However, since 7 o'clock in the morning, we have been sitting on the back to the cold past, the Berlin luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.

What is it?
What does Wen have in mind?
The fans do not.
Not even even by itself.
It already has something to say about it.

Others emphasize that it is true that it is precisely in the United States and Britain with its new single What do you do in place.
He himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in many of this.
At least he is doing so.
Bringing It to Home
Potatoes, or?
ES is both.
Inspired by the saying, it is inspired by a poster of a poster that has put both meat and meat together on one hand.
On the idea it brought him to a poster with the label of potatoes instead of the one that he was seen to have seen on television.
In his store is one who is equipped with meat and potatoes.
What makes it possible for the stomach to move, it is believed to be one of them.
The idea has now been recorded at the Patent Office in Munich.
This is where it has recently been protected as a source of information by the Authority.
How much of meat and potato does not want to be betrayed by this.
There is nothing less than that: What tastes together is better than that which is better.
Even with its clients, the culinary is good.
It starts to fight against anything you want
Try to protect it from a situation in South Australia and Western Australia.
It has been launched to defend the market share of the people at South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to an estimated 700 million dollars a year.
Whereas at the beginning of next year, the opening of two new jobs and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia is being prepared, it will strengthen its relations with local markets and build the brand through marketing and marketing via social media as well as events.
Suppliers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like trade from brands that are distributed in samples that are distributed, and those that sell tickets for the South Australian to loyal customers.
ES is expected that further details of his/will be published on 29 September if the food, alcohol and equipment is carried out annually.
ES is at the top of the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of total and generate higher levels than those in the market.
With regard to South Australia and Western Australia, they have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, and more than 30% in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the US.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that, 12 months after the opening of its first markets, about five percent of the deal will be available in these two states, and that all existing actors, but mainly independent sales, will become sales.
According to a report published this week by Morgan Stanley, 360 million revenue per year could be lost by 360 million up to the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and drink, and the quantity of high-volume imports, could cost around $13 million before interest and taxes, saying Mr More.
At the same time, the market is losing market share in terms of business, mainly in domestic and foreign markets, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan states that it is the same as those that are involved.
Morgan Stanley estimates that GDP growth in food and trade by 3.8 percent in 2016, and 2.1% in 2018 in 2016, will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to up to 2020% by 2020.
Last week, the leader in leadership, the founder of the Financial Group, said in a Melbourne that it is likely to disappear within a decade.
He refused to respond publicly to Mr Evans's comments.
But it is expected that a member of the board of directors will be in contact with Mr President last week.
Market share since 2010 has fallen from 18% to 14 percent, and revenues from food and fuel income, which covers about 1,200, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational cost of increased pressure on sales and margins.
However, one of them is investing more than $150 million to bring it into line with male and female players with hundreds of products per week, and help them improve their stores through rapidly growing fresh food, and deliver a better selection of them.
It is a question of Ian saying that it is going to go on fire and hoping that, for the first time in four years, it will return to another for the first time in the year of 2017.
It is supported by the President of Australia for Steve Jobs, which is supported by the president of Australian.
It deserves to be praised as a criticism of his behavior.
One of them was one of the most recent storms in the recent storm around his friend Nick, and according to the president of Australian Steve deserves praise as a criticism rather than criticism of his own conduct.
The most recent of the more talented people who are repeatedly known as a Special Ks came to the fore as a result of the infamous dispute with Stan at Montreal Masters.
In one of them soon afterwards, and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison said he had to beat him and I was going to beat the child.
While he was last seen how he was defending a residential after a potential home of Richard, he was steadfastly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam to second place behind Bernard in the United Kingdom of America.
A thing about which I am pretty busy is the fact that I think a little was going into the dispute, he said it.
He has a racquet when he lost because of a race in the mine, but he is not the first player to have a racquet from a club with himself, and I know good enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in his class, even under the rather odd circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much credit.
He has a great team around himself, he has a great family around himself, and I think he has been treated somewhat too strictly.
He is a very busy person, he is working very hard, and he fits to the team and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is fully respected and trained hard, he is trained hard, it is good in form, it is a very stable of young people,
He also supported the decision not to take into account the importance of the important that begins on Friday, which begins on Friday and describes the joint decision to be taken as the right one for everyone, but it assures that the man in Canberra is to return to the team as a long-term part of the team.
First of all, we wish that the team would be fully focused on competition and that it would not focus on all of the controversies surrounding the project that took place around it.

Europe's point of view: Hungary declares that Hungary declares its borders, and that it holds refugees back.
Hungary declares the trade with Serbia with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that attempted to come illegally to the country, with the aim of putting an end to the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed on the border when hundreds of migrants responded with indignation in a country of war and Serbian officials.
The people who had fled violence spent an unknown time in a road on the road between the two countries of the country and settled there.
But they have increased.
When one of them was talking about them, migrants would open the border.
Some fields back out of protest of food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister declared that it is unacceptable that migrants should be returned from Hungary, while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia, Serbia, wants to be part of the solution, rather than being one.
ES must be held in the coming days with talks with Brussels and other countries, said said business in Prague.
The turbulence on the border has not been able to reconcile a single immigration policy during a controversial meeting in Brussels during a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece in Italy and Greece, and they hope that, after the end of the year, an agreement would be reached, that the EU countries would include further refugee refugees, including some from Hungary.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent's climate.
However, Hungary did not place its hopes on an early action from Brussels or from its neighbours.
The two southern regions on Tuesday gave more powers to authorities to deal with the crisis, so that they were able to accelerate roads and asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter said that his country also plans to build a border along its border with Romania in order to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence along the Serbian border.
CBS reported Charlie when he reported that he was even used during the race to build the relationship between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major source of income in the Middle East and for many people in the Middle East, and one that has become part of the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of those who are involved in search for a better life are in search of a better life, and that they do not have the right to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, will cross the border or establish a crime that is subject to a crime that the government used on the southern border of Serbia to become a crime, as these laws also establish higher standards for the people who have been sentenced to death.
The situation that arose as a result of the growth explains how the Hungarian Government declares the war, said, said more than 20% of the population of the southern city.
We say it is very clear: Illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament still needs to approve the military use of the military who is expected for next week, but reporters from the group of reporters who have already been seen on the border with heavy vehicles with vehicles and vehicles have already been seen on the border.
What happened to him, for Orban, said that authorities were 45 people when trying to cross the border, while 15 others were already deeper into the country.
They arrive by damaging the fence, they are now in prison and they are accused of criminal acts according to the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also concluded two of the seven remaining with Serbia, after one had reached a border in order to close the borders.
Chaos brings the most important of the most important near the, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in one in order to work on the data of people and put them back to move there.
About 20 managed to succeed, but thousands were left out of it.
Another group of migrants called the most important of Serbian and Hungarians, and said they would refuse food and water until they can enter Hungary.
Note: Hillary lead the lead in advance of the national survey by half.
Former Hillary Clinton still holds a lead in the democratic race for a nomination at a national level, but Senator gains a grip on land.
Clinton now has the support of 47% of democratic voters who account for 47% of the time, while second is second, with a 27% increase by 17 percent.
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is in favour of the project, receives support for 15% of the democratic voters of the.
More than five months before the start, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they believe they will support them.
But supporters of support are more than those of the other candidates in their election.
Since the past, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while some profits have been achieved.
Clinton holds a great advantage among women and men, but this has fallen.
Your support for men has fallen sharply, and there are 5 points in this.
Advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has become stronger, and they are now at the same level.
But Clinton has a big advantage among the elderly.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of a lead with the Liberals, but it now has a deal with this group.
About half of the country's democratic voters say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some, and a further 15% of them would only support them because they are the same.
They would not support them 6%.
Perhaps it is not surprising that some of the current supporters are enthusiastic about it.
The views are more mixed among those who do not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them.
While 48% of democratic voters in Turkey say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer voters say that they spend 35% of their money on their own.
When supporters of support in an open question are asked why they want them to be the, is the most common answer that she has the right experience has the right experience has about 16 percent to follow, followed by the belief that it is time that a woman president is going to be 13 percent of the job and that she
Her connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned by her connection with Bill Clinton.
Agreement on dealing with problems and issues are also cited.
As the Vice-President throws up a potential for the growth in the world, 57 percent of the people's democratic constituents want to see him in the race - though one-third believes that he should not do it.
If democratic voters are asked about who is their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Among them, more than half say that Biden would be far ahead of her second election.
If Biden decides not to stand for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary will increase the lead in advance, from 20 points with Biden to 30 points without him in race.
Clinton's percent of democratic voters regard Clinton as the best chance to win the election, but this figure has fallen from 78% to last month.
Biden is by far the second to measure this measure, but the percentage that it considers to be the same as the one it produces has increased.
Nevertheless, when it comes to what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about the benefits.
Just like last month, no single candidate or potential candidate stands as unacceptable for these voters.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results on a number of key features when it comes to voters of their party.
Majorities view Clinton, and Biden and Biden are honest, full, and strong.
Biden performs best among the three candidates in honesty, while strength is leadership.
Thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and honest, twice as many of them say it is 15% of GDP, but 27 percent do not believe in it.
Democratic voters in general also see Clinton, and Biden in ideological terms in accordance with their views.
With all of these measurements, about one quarter of the democratic electorate has no opinion of anything.
As questions about Hillary's use of a personal email address and a server remain as Secretary of State during the term of office as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter, and say that it has not influenced their views as a whole.
But it is another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one third is happy.
Public opinion was divided in March when the problem came to light.
Most Americans have said that they do not have an impact on Clinton's overall opinion, though 36% have said that their opinion has deteriorated.
ES are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that their Clinton views have become worse.
Though Clinton is seen as honest and successful by voters in her party, this is still a problem for them among voters in general: Only 32% of voters see them as honest, honest, 8% less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of them do not think they are an honest person.
At the same time, 55 percent of people across the country also see themselves as being non-honest.
However, Clinton and Their will receive good marks with leadership.
Of the six candidates who are candidates, Biden, Bush and Bush are best in honesty.
A majority seems more likely to be honest, but there is no opinion of him as in the case of anything.
The error rate for the participation of voters in the case of voters in Cuba is 6 percentage points.
Ben moves close to Donald in a survey that is close to Donald.
Ben is based in the latest survey of CBS News New York Times close to Donald.
The two candidates now account for half of the voters" support in the new poll, and others lose out dramatically.
Voters continue to support large numbers of voters across the country, and support is growing by 23% in the last year that was held before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in Tuesday's poll.
However, in the same period they amount to 23% over the same period.
The survey also showed that population is good for demographic groups and that it is higher than Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of the most recent and John Paul of John, is with governor Scott Walker, who fell in love, and 10% support last month at 2%.
Former President Bush, the former governor of Mike himself and Marco Marco is now 6 per cent on the third place.
This is 6% of the number of people who have been involved in this latest survey, and it has been carried out in September.
The latest CNN, which was released last week, shows that in the polls it is increasing - it ends up with 19% support in the case of 32% support behind the 32% support.
The survey that took place in ABC News by Washington Post also showed much of this before.
With a glance at one that took place last week, there was a couple of things for the former, even after they were calling into question the idea of calling into question faith in the past.
When we need energy, said last Saturday during a deal in Iowa.
Pleasant: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Even if they are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to provide warm water.
At a maximum of 17 degrees, a bath in the North or the Baltic will be a short pleasure.
It is no longer possible to go into the sea: The water in the north and the Baltic has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, dividing the German with an estimated 18 ° with each other.
On the other hand, there is still the Mediterranean: There is up to 29 degrees in the East.
In the Adriatic, it is 25 degrees at the top, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the family charged with the death of a married person
Almost two years ago, after a student passed away during a case of a deal in the United States of America, Pennsylvania will be filed against five persons.
In September 2013, members of New York attacked Deng for a brutal attack against Deng, and sent the police to hospital to carry out transport to the hospital which contributed to his death.
Officials have said that he has been burdened with a full sea of sand, and he has been repeatedly put into action while trying to reach a goal by means of a single field.
After all, Mr. Deng finally overcame about headaches, after which he fell in love.
The members of the family did not call the series 911 after Deng was used and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, so the police.
However, they had the time to change clothing to change their symptoms, and Andy used to contact the national president of the in order to seek advice, telling Chris Wagner at a press conference.
Working at this point began to hide members to hide them, and the good of the in principle about that of Michael Deng said he said.
He could not be resurrected, and he died on his injuries the next morning.
After one of them, Deng has been repeatedly added to injury to the head, the hull, and the hull by means of the force that has been put into effect on a number of occasions.
At least one student since 1970 dies of harassment every year, said Douglas, a lawyer who represents the family, dies in a statement.
Women and their members must be held accountable, and this is a very important step by authorities.
A County Grand Jury of General recommended a charge for murder of third parties for the first five members.
People who are members of the family, including Mr, will also be charged with acts of violence and the formation of a criminal association.
We not only want to make people responsible for the people involved, but if there is an organisation that - official or official - this is something that we can call to account, said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The College College has banned the latter, and national immigration has revoked its membership.
That will happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
One thing that happens is one that is getting worse, returns for bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know this.
What we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will become.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first and lasted 86 months.
The role of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, albeit not always, a factor in how the economy and the response react.
This is why representatives of the former have emphasised so strongly that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates, but rather that they will focus on the period that is needed for normalisation.
Indeed, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the excitement of a deal might have been exaggerated.
America's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money to be interpreted, said Julian, a communication to clients, said Julian.
By contrast, we do not expect to see the gradual return of normal to normal heights, but a low level to lead to the shock that many people seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a view of historic trends as to how certain areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, the number of things that can be done for a while can be made for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
It seems that there seems to be a tendency that 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy, is reflected in a recent study, and this is what the Fed has done.
To be more precise, the market is mostly in about 14 percent - about 14 percent in the last 35 years - on the way to the, pretty flat in the 250 days after it has been released from 2.6% of the market, which then goes back to the last 500 days, with an average yield in the past six past cycles according to a recent analysis that published Bob Doll, Chief of Asset Management in the case of
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on equities tends to occur later in the run, and that the yield begins to diminish.
They are a fact of life, but they often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that were not previously and which could accelerate a recession.
What is most remarkable is that GDP will be near its lowest point in a Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, since 1950 it has been only about 4.5 percent of GDP since 1950.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect this to last and expect only 1.5% for the third quarter of the Atlanta Fed.
What could be risky in this kind of economic background might be risky, raising the question as to whether this time is different, saying Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have drawn up the Fed all the year round, and all eyes were addressed to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many economists and economists believe that this could allow an increase in this session, there is a probability of 25%.
In our study, all of them from 1950 to the present day have taken place with an increasing momentum in GDP, and quickly put them in the shadows after the beginning of recovery, according to the report.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months.
Fixed income was also a source of income, as the market is a market and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
It is true that the effect of bonds is faster than in the case of equities if they change their strategic course.
With bonds, returns seem to shift direction as soon as the first increase is achieved in the cycle.
At the end of the day fall the which falls immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab believes that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds, leading to a shift in the curve.
Bond bonds in such a climate often bring better yields, though we are still careful to expect higher yields, said drug Jones, business with Schwab, in an analysis.
What makes Jones interesting is that the markets have already adapted to their needs.
When it comes to the strength of the dollar and the decline of the market, there are signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy.
Interest rates have increased, the growth has increased, it has expanded, and volatility has increased - all of the market's characteristics is that the Fed is tightening its strategy.
In general, companies that handle most of their business in the US will benefit from raising interest rates and making local products more attractive.
Firms with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market, and also finance their debts.
History History shows that quality in quality tends to respond three months after an initial, Goldman said in a report for clients.
Companies with a strong balance have surpassed companies with weak results after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 businesses, by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high and low volatility in their shares also include their low quality on average of 4% per year and 3 percentage points on average.
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most, said Goldman.
Beyond mere spending, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Profits could be seen through higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the classic FM, it is said to have a copy of the Classic FM.
The conservative Member of Parliament has criticized the station for his/her own.
He argues that he is increasingly different from commercial rivals.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, and said that she was only The Kind
One of the reasons for this was that it was not very original when he took part in the program The Voice and said it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 converts itself to Classic FM, claims a leading edge, and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that it does something that does not do it.
The Conservative MP Andrew also said that public service radio is more different than that of commercial competitors.
Radio 3 seems - I don't like the word I like the word - I don't like it - but it seems to be classic FM to transform, he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards which took place last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, only appear to be under a different name.
So, if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you only know what is already on the market, said Mr Mr.
It rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is ahead of its commercial rivals when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and that which is really good.
Design And the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on order is also really important for important, he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan argued that it is necessary to work harder to get involved with the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, radio 3 was not the only element of the one that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport to stand on the feet of commercial rivals.
It was the voice of The Voice, which was purchased from the BBC, which was bought by the Dutch producer for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed, because it is not original and it is not special?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC, which was a judge of love and boy George, was produced on a special basis in particular.
He added, he hopes that the company will find a hit from our own stable when it is next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of other ranks of The Voice in the future, or to spend money on other types of money.
It was possible for this to take place in August, and the Black Friday can be responsible for this.
In the first three months of 2015, there has been a 7% increase in revenue.
Last month, there was the lowest result since records began in 2000.
Strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slowed down expenditure.
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has become one of them, and many of the British have turned into action.
But experts tell us that there are now signs that, as new figures show only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
August for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the start of the record in 2000, with only five percent increase compared with the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that, with new figures, new figures account for only 7% of growth in the first three months of 2015.
When you look at the growth rates for these and go back to 2000, then it has become increasingly developed over time, as Andy said it was the editor of the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago they reinforced purchases as buyers to make purchases with their mobile phones.
ES meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments.
However, this is now a thing of the past and we will probably see growth reduced.
The deal that was imported from America is cited as a source of revenue in sales.
Experts believe that buyers reserve their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of buyers around their computers to make their way out of buyers was five times the average.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in whom the buyer can prevent purchases, to make purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that £5 £was spent online.
More than one third of purchases are now being carried out by some products, such as television and television.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, rather than in the in the car.
Muslims are buried in Mecca when they reach their homes - Bin Laden is a family.
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first time in Mecca through the streets.
Saudi Arabia places part of the collapse of part of the huge scale of the burden of load
The key has been that people have also been injured as a whole after they have crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims congregated when 29 were driven by the streets to bury the people who were killed, as one of those who had been forced to enter their homes.
Filled, largely dressed in white, the track to pay their respect, when the first of the dead will be their last trip to the.
The latter passed to the Sacred site, where only days ago, the mosque crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the last one.
The bodies were released for their use when, because of the catastrophe which also left injuries left, Bin Laden imposed a sanction on Bin Laden's family because of the catastrophe which also left injured people to be injured.
The bodies of 29 people who were killed, who were killed as a result of the Great, have been carried by the streets.
Among the dead, there was a population of more than half of the population, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first when he was one of them.
Mr Berman was with his parents before the start of the annual residence in the Great Mosque.
They have already promised that the Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that he would not have been the arm of the race when he was not being used.
An Arab version of the country that has been released by the state of Saudi Arabia Press Agency has said that it is partly responsible for collapse.
The English speaking service of the business did not report this detail, but it was said that the management of the company was banned.
At the beginning of this week, Salman Salman, who caused the fall of the one that crashed into an inner courtyard of the city where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the last that took place later this month.
Nothing was said about the collapse of the former, and its representatives were not at the disposal of an opinion.
This is something that the group does not have because of current safety measures, because it has not cooperated with them.
Dozens of people around the world surround it as part of the massive volume that is led by the people.
For decades, the Bin Laden family has been associated with the use of Saudi Arabia and it is taking over larger ones.
The Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a son who became the family of the family in the years to come.
The collapse of the car came in the midst of strong winds and rain, only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the people who are required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials ordered that 1 million GBP should be paid to members of the family for £1 million and that the same amount would be permanently injured.
Other injured receive half of this amount.
B & Q Boss says that the time of the cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen,
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased behind it.
This means that 200 more aimed at craftsmen will be opened.
At the same time, it will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide.
By Rupert Steiner, City of Daily Mail
ES is claimed that Britons use their rings and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East European, which carry out the work in their homes,
If you can handle walls with a hammer or a brush, you seem to belong to a minority today.
For British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out their homes, leaving the company behind B & Q
It said that a big increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe was now out of date. This meant that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe would increase the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe.
Therefore, it is planned to open 200 more shops, which are aimed at craftsmen and 60 sales outlets of B & Q
She said that she wants to employ more women in B & B, because eight out of ten in the store are hit by women.
At present, men predominate among employees.
She said it is necessary to face up to the growing demographic trends that are more female than in the past.
She said she said: "There is still a majority of men in our stores.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
As a matter of principle, half of our clients comprise 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of goods by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Mann, who is one of five who is the head of one of the leading companies in one of the world's leading companies, also has a role to take to reflect the same number of men and women in management positions.
It is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and business.
She said this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue.
ES was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
This is a reduction in the number of people who have been involved in the process of closing the shop, as the group costs the cost of closing the shops.
Because of the trend it will be able to open 200 new branches because of the trends that are owned by the company and the B & Q.
Officials of Académie on Contracts for a Court of Justice in Court
On Wednesday, two officials of Austria will have to answer on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian right.
The people who were accused are not guilty of this.
One of them was also accused of substance.
From this allegation, he became a legal force in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Robert, the accused was that in the years from 2006 to 2011, the accused used money for private purposes by means of funds that they were allowed to use in their functions.
This is the damage he has done with around 400,000 Euros.
They are also charged with charges of property.
This is a fact that has left the president of the project, the leader of the market, as a result of this.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
For the purpose of the defense, the defense was that the club was not created at any time.
They would only have been able to take off and pay the same for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011, and they would have invested a great deal of time and money, from the debt of about 600,000 in 2001.
At that time, we were faced with the situation: Let us carry on and close the club.
He then decided to carry out this task with his colleague and colleague.
With all the risks.
We have money We have money, our security as security at the bank to buy money, he said at the event.
It has been agreed with the Association: You can manage the money freely, it is impossible to make any debts.
What is more, in case of financial success, the disbursement of the goods has been decided retrospectively until 1991.
That is why part of it was paid out years later, namely from 2003, when it had been added to the account.
That is why the former explained what was going to happen.
The accounts and the bonds administered by the two defendants together said the second one.
Why the disbursements to the club had not been detailed in detail, the latter asked.
The association did not care for the detail for the detail that was important, this was the answer.
When, in 2011, an investigation of a project began, an amount of EUR 1 000 was transferred to it.
They have been active, and they have declared the accused.
This ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known according to what the club was saying.
What do you know when you want to know what to do?
The company did not know about this for a long time.
Then, after all, he thought he believed that this was the best for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything of this money, putting the Public Prosecutor in the room.
The person who had been informed of this was one of the people who took part in it.
This bank transfer was formulated as a case of use as a foreign product.
Why do they want to know what they wanted to do?
The first of these stated that he was not in favour of this formulation because the club had never been damaged.
But what can I do if the lawyer says?
What he said, he asked what he said, that he was one of them.
He also said he had never paid a cent of salary, that he simply charged himself with only the question of what he had to do.
On average, he charged EUR 1,000 per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Exact documents for the early years could not be seen by the accused.
They were no longer kept after a career in which everything had been judged correctly, and they declared.
The second was also referred to as the second one.
All of them are in cash in cash, so he has said that he has to drive to the bank from his place of residence as he said in his statement.
The latter will continue on September 23 with the survey of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard Discounts 30 000 jobs
In addition to the current situation of three years, the company will reduce the number of jobs it has taken during the company's activities.
There is no end to the release of Hewlett-Packard, which is based in Hewlett-Packard.
Within the framework of its restructuring, the project plans to phase out the dismantling of between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs.
As a result of this, the company was expected to save costs to the tune of €2.7 billion, which was saved on Tuesday by the company on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a total of around 2.7 billion dollars, which will accrue from the fourth quarter.
The current dismantling of jobs has not yet been completed for three years.
At the end of the 2013 fiscal year, HP employed around 14 employees.
There was a 2.3% increase in the rate of production.
The company with printers from the Palo Alto is currently in a position where it is intended to be bundled together in a new company this year - separately from the areas with small and medium-sized enterprises for companies as well as to other services.
Both are to be listed on the stock exchange.
Once again, it is one of the largest and most common sources of service to Lenovo.
In the third year, at the end of July, sales of PC and printers fell by%%.
Sales fell by 8 percent to almost €billion billion.
As a result, the proceeds dropped to 15 out of 16.
HP responds to changes in the industry with a strong focus on change in the industry.
The 76 years old company under the leadership of the market has only late responded to the need for customers to buy smart phones, to buy better than conventional computers - and to do more and more shops on line online.
As a whole, all of this is intended to reduce the number of jobs that can be achieved.
Conflicts: Majority in support of the latter
A direct involvement of German soldiers in Iraq in Iraq would be overwhelmingly opposed: 54 per cent of languages are opposed to 35%.
The fact that other states are flying against the Islamic State in Iraq and in aviation is positive.
24 percent is against intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian leaders rejects 51% of respondents, 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent was unable to take a decision.
Auto: Take advantage of the 66 th IAA on the 66 th IAA.
The focus of the trade fair is to 27 September, to vehicles, to motor vehicles and to the individual.
After two years, German Chancellor Angela Merkel joins the 66.
The large public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA VDA expect to see about 900 000 visitors with about 900 000 visitors two years ago.
Point of Use: Return to Border Borders
The Hungarian police have used several hundred years of refugees on the Serbian border.
One of the things that he saw is that he was one of the first to live with him.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees border the border.
Behind this, there was a very good deal and there was a willingness to take part behind the police.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones in the hands of officials.
First of all, officials constantly put an end to this.
After that, the police used them.
Much was done in the direction of the refugees.
That is what the group has dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little.
A woman who seems to be injured was taken from the zone.
Children who had the product had had their own.
Other refugees joined forces and suffered from them.
Also, the police of the Serbian police suffered injury through the use of male and female people.
Time of a decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve is meeting on Wednesday and Thursday to take the important decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey among 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half, which was still last week that the Fed would do, is that the Fed is now thinking that the Fed will remain stuck a bit longer, and that interest rates will remain at zero -% of% at present.
ES is a historic event because it is seven years old since the Fed fixed interest rates.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank might leave the country, and a process of normalisation of interest rates is beginning, Angel said.
The US economy is on a relatively good track, and trillions of dollars are added to balance sheet, only generating low inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less prospect of global conditions
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but signs suggest that the chances of such a move are good.
The decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday.
Left at Delta State University
After killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later came to his colleagues his colleagues and his colleagues on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note in order to say that it was tired of doing it to the first murder of the first murder and he wanted to make it possible that public authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in occupied, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer in geography and education at the Delta State University, which took place against 10: 00 on Monday morning.
And he said he was shot on someone who killed someone.
He said that the police said that the police had to send policemen to their homes.
He said yesterday evening I used my wife last night, and he also mentioned that a pet is a dog that is in the house, but that nobody will disturb anyone, but it is likely to be one of them.
The police asked about his name, but he did not give it.
There was no explanation of what he had to say.
As the police the scene the scene, they found the body of Amy, 41, and a note from Lamb, 45 who said: I'm so sorry, I wanted to cancel it, and I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University, where he drove a professor of history, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening, as a policeman him him.
He said that he had nothing to say about a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but there was, of course, something in Mr Solana's idea.
Despite reports on Monday, which Lamb allegedly believed that there was also a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was no information, there was no evidence, and there was no evidence of any kind of marketing.
He was married to a family of people who believed it would have been possible for him to take part in this.
The two were born 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
He said that he had a daughter who was 19, and she was destroyed on the ground.
He said that her daughter, her daughter, was absolutely best friends.
Online worked online from home, according to what was known by the Sun Herald, which was identified as a close friend of business.
He said that a dog that possessed a dog had been hit with lamb for about three years.
Move she wanted to help other people, he said she said "
The police said Lamb called relatives at a particular time on Monday to tell them that he does not go to prison.
As a policeman on the highway 1 near the home later at that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled to the forest, ran into the forest and was shot with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, the Delta State University was awarded a certificate of conduct as indicated on the University's website.
Stars who have lost their jobs
The actor who has left his left, in the picture with his son he on the right to the right of the right had a few years of life.
In 2001 he fought against him, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, which has been cancer because of cancer.
The actor is alleged to be fighting with drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced to death.
All of this is certainly taking its toll.
Train: Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa plans a big deal.
Half a billion euro per year wants to save money with a better organisation.
150 of the world's approximately 1000 executives will cost the job at work.
However, new negotiations are being negotiated with the latter.
Lufthansa builds up its business and evaluates the changes that have been made to it.
The target of realignment is around EUR 500 million per year from cost and cost, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a management board for the latter.
It is to be developed as independently as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich will be responsible for the involvement of Karl Ulrich.
With the latter, it underlines the importance of the role that the Group intends to take in in the future to combat Ryanair and its partners.
So far, the organisation of the 120 000 employee has been complex.
The airline under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the case of the cockpit of the cockpit of VC, negotiations are scheduled to resume on Thursday after the legal strike on Thursday.
That was what the trade union did.
The theme of the talks is intended to be a pilot for pilots.
Cockpit intended in one year to achieve good results as soon as possible in one year.
The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the pilot of pilots, the background is the one which is the subject of occupation of wings.
It is clear that Lufthansa, in the fight against competitors, is taking part in the role of a person who is in charge of it.
Under the title of Collective in the South, paintings can be seen in the course of the year.
The company, which has been based in Göttingen for a long time, has put together a selection of works for the White Room of the House, which their viewers have to take to travel on a voyage.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United is unable to play for months on account of his/
Luke Shaw, who was born in Manchester at Manchester, suffered a double degree in his right at Eindhoven, where he was in Eindhoven.
While this is the left to cry and exclude it for at least six months from playing, Louis van does not give hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by an attack by one of the people who had approached it in the 15 minute, after the 20-year-old Shaw was in the making.
He was treated to the playing field for nine minutes, and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
As he said, he has a double room and is located in the hospital.
He will be moved tomorrow, or perhaps a day later, in Manchester.
ES is awful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, has a very hard time, and then plays fantastic, happens, and then it happens.
In the latter, he had a number of things to do.
He is taking part.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a duplicate, it will take six months and it will not play in the same.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a Red card and the imposition of a deal.
Nicola, the referee, has not punished the person.
What was more, it was the Italian referee who had something to say.
You can judge for yourself when I say that one and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack on both legs.
I would like to thank all of you for your messages, words can't describe how I broke, my way to heal starts now, I'll get back again.
As for Manchester United, Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw when he won the match.
With the European Championships in France, there is an additional incentive for them to join forces by next June.
Phillip, who said, said It is a very bad injury.
If a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, everyone is very sad.
ES is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a custom when Mexico played against Van in 2014 during the 2014 World Cup.
It is very difficult because it was not his intention to injure the enemy, and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury, it is not good to say it said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I was able to see was the ball that was on the road in a different direction, so it was going as if he had touched him Moreno Moreno who touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with her, Moreno said: I know how difficult it is, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad, I am so sorry.
It was also brought to the hospital by Chris, who was also brought to hospital by Chris.
Of course, David Cameron knows the better better?
ES is one thing that all parents learn soon: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost.
Be it because you are probably David Cameron.
When he was asked to name himself as a supplier of business, the Prime Minister of America, the Prime Minister of The Netherlands, decided in 1971 that he was a member of the Board of Directors of Germany.
ES was a difficult election, Cameron wrote in a message on the site of the company, and continues: Fun, fun, creative, and with a positive message, it is a book that I like to bring my children to a book which I like to give to my children because it always seems to be an image or a message we have missed so far
It all is fine and good, except that the next paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reflects a summary of the 2012, which includes new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
In the midst of the city where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy hopes to win the heart of the heart of winning the girl of his dreams by reading their wish to see a real tree.
As if this were not yet suspect, the text put forward by Cameron reads as the summary of the one that is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database begins: To enter the city where everything is artificial, and even the air is a commodity, a boy hopes to win the heart of the heart of winning the girl of his dreams.
Although he is responsible for being a born father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book.
This was a relatively low volume for a helper who did not have a child for 20 times.
One official said that the text is likely to have come from home.
Confirmed that the text was delivered by staff of office, there were no further direct comments.
Adam was clearly under threat from the exclusion of England's team, but it is still hard to do so.
It is a difficult task to meet on Pakistan in the United Arab, but if you look at the one that England has chosen for the tour, then a repeat of the mine does not appear on my card.
I would not rule out one.
It may be better than it was three years ago, but there is a good deal in the market, and it is strong that there will be no scars from 2012.
With the ball develops himself Ali develops itself as a medium and a medium, even if it is an unknown size on top it is an option for the attack.
Message that is related: Adam makes use of his/her name and is replaced by Alex.
The decision of Adam is, of course, for me to be his in Yorkshire, difficult to analyze.
There were two good attacks on his seven tests under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that they are focused on results.
ES gave no question marks to Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination as - and I said earlier - players are their own best.
Long ago, the race would have been extended, but it had control over its own destiny.
If I hope he gets more of them for Yorkshire, then there is another chance.
It does not surprise me even if he does not carry out such good performance, and he is first and foremost one of them.
The question of how long a deal is given to set its mark is difficult.
He won seven chances, such as Sam before him, while Nick received nine.
Only of course did it get the chance to come on and get rid of it.
The only charge one can claim was that England first used Jonathan in the Caribbean, but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex comes in in return, and he is one that I have high regard.
He is one of the things we saw in Yorkshire early in this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which was a great deal for us.
He must have at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this depends, of course, on what is happening in the United Arab.
The idea of making use of Cook, which would deliver a good deal, and receiving four has appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why there is no room for manoeuvre there, and this has already shown that it is one of the things it is about.
He might not have done his job for his County, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
I previously played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared in the first row in 2001.
He managed immediately and looked not back.
It is possible for me to know what happens to me, and in my limited way of dealing with him, he impressed me as a young man.
People might see its statistics on average 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and think it is a living, but there is no great number of people who collect their hands, and the trainers have chosen for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England has made a couple of clever additions to his work.
The appointment of someone who has been appointed as a consultant to Sri Lanka, a consultant for the budget, might be one.
He is one of the most popular of the game, which will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul comes for the white tour of the tour and brings energy and a lot of use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for international fame, as a player or as a coach, and like him he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with what was said before.
At Durham, Ben is not used, root received a similar break with Australia and for mine I have no problem with it.
Some will not agree, but they do not determine the timetable.
And you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
Britain's right of exit from the EU could win at a time when the economy is getting into a factory by 2017.
When it comes to keeping Britain in the EU, David is going to get deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of Jeremy I think it is yes or no.
Foreigners also have their own and Nigel.
One European recently said that some member states, so deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now, and not always on their own fault, Britain's self-produced agenda with domestic and other changes in treaty changes that they usually do not wish to see.
In Brighton, the latter decided on their own that it might not be in danger if they were to endanger social protection.
We could also mention Dave and Georges, one of them.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at summits or meetings in foreign capitals, make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, come home and say that they win allies for reform.
ES is always about me.
My European friend, who wants to see Britain who wants to go to Britain outside - something we do not want to do with France alone, says Berlin - and it makes it possible for more and more ministers and officials to come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or go.
German cautious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally, but she has been in power for 10 years, and wants to leave office before it looks as bad for her as it is with the excessively long one like Thatcher, 11 years of politics, Mitterrand of 14, and Kohl she is 16.
France's François Hollande looks to his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
It is also a force of change.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain one left.
It is hard to imagine that they will become a leg to help the one whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK, what they want to avoid.
Therefore, it is possible that some of these ministers are even deliberately planning unhelpful notes, which is due to my friend as Britain is going to speed up by 2017 in order to speed up the budget.
It was a default, and Britain did not win anything of value out of the United Kingdom, which was a bankruptcy.
Europeans know how to be able to cover their costs, and what is what it is when it was during Tony's referendum in 1975 which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
You can remember Boris Johnson, the man who has made a name of himself as one of the last years she has made in the early years.
For all of his people, Ed knew who his enemies were.
To this end, it was the same as that of people who are involved in, one of them, foreigners and the people who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was similar to him, but it noted that if you are sitting with a hot drink in one, you'll better distribute bananas in order not to become lunch and dinner.
In fact, more than Blair himself was more involved than Blair himself when he turned to himself when he turned to himself when he came to grips with the idea of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters who opened it a back door in 2005.
The press has never had it to him.
But the good Jeremy who gave me a warm welcome to me on Monday at Westminster - I said to him that he does not need time for me to come back to me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil's boycott of the strategy of the years to come, and it seems to me today.
ES may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew whose party he left on Sunday.
Official position with regard to Europe is - I press it friendly - it is in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Now, most of the people who live outside traditional countries that are traditional can surely say "yes" to anyone who can say yes.
ES is what is something that was used by one of them, one of them, but no one who was talking about it on radio and television this week when he was fighting in him, not to admit that the appointment of John was a bad idea when he was appointed John.
ES reminded me of the years when his old father worked on television to be able to be in front of his mouth without going too far.
It has made combat more attractive.
But to fight in order to remain equal under all circumstances, it was not what was said about what was said about it.
Whatever it is, it is important for me to communicate with you that it is important for me to communicate, that in the age of TV it is important around the clock and, above all, in the context of social media, of a person who is responsible for it and of betrayal.
ES is right when it is right that Cameron does not give an opportunity to Europe for Europe, which allows him to maintain support for support in that which has been said to be a matter of course.
Simon certainly thinks like this.
But it is no longer just a matter of discussion among leftist dissidents that is a central principle of conflict with regard to membership of EU membership, its past, and its past.
As with his campaign to NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that no campaign is going to exit - foreign diplomats will be required to try to find a point for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, - they also have voters as voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya, and with a reduction in the cost of power in power, as I was reminded when I started on Monday about what British called Security Forum.
Experts criticise the report of Public Health England
Allegations of a state-funded agency that are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links with the tobacco industry, researchers saying.
Experts, who write in the British Medical Journal, joined forces by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England in its report on the verification they have received.
It published the last month last month, and describes it as a comprehensive review of the evidence.
But some researchers have questioned the resilience of data, focusing on the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
One of the last months of last month's medical journal was the exceptionally strong basis on which his most important conclusion was based on his most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in to him and asked if the claims made in stone or sand build up.
Martin, Professor of European Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon, Professor of Clinical at the University of Liverpool, said that A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on effectiveness.
You have said that the public expects the claim of that that is the current best estimate is that it is about 95% less harmful than smoking, that it is based on a detailed review of the documents and the modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who have been convened to develop a model for a model for a model for a person to make a model of action, in order to make their opinions about the damage of various products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a single.
It was said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Business Health, whose managers had previously received funds from British American Tobacco Products for an independent study.
He also gave the references of BAT to public health in one, they said.
One of the 12 people who attended the meeting declared that funds should be kept from one year to another, but it did not add to the funding that it would have received from Philip Morris International after reports have been reported.
The reasons for the selection of members of the committee will not be delivered, but several of them are known ones, some of which include a paper on paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in the race.
It also took part in the meetings to take part.
The research of the group admits that it declares that there is a lack of hard evidence for the damage done by most products on most criteria.
However, none of these connections or restrictions is discussed in the same.
What they say is that the claims of business that there is no evidence that there is no evidence to date that, as a way of smoking for children or non-smokers, was premature.
Companion Kevin, director of health and well-being at home, said it responded to what was claimed before.
He said it is a lot less harmful than smoking is.
Every second lifelong smoker is dying of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of average are low, but that we continue to have the effects to study.
It is clear that there is a clear duty to inform the public about what is proved and what does not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health Service £2 billion per year.
By showing clear evidence of current evidence that it is not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage that is caused by smoking, we meet our national competence.
BBC should give up, says former CEO of Channel 4
The former chair of Channel 4, Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop sending programs like e.g. and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals would give their right arm to their right arm, which would be as good as that of Albert Square.
Johnson said that the only use should be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other people.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in stark contrast to the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters.
After the company, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he tried to contact Channel 4 for six years without success to get in contact with the BBC.
I have problems with the idea that the BBC Programme is being commissioned or that it would clearly not be shown by non-strategic rivals, Johnson said to him as part of his inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep in mind what I consider to be a good idea in the medium term or in the long term, then it should be produced at least on programs that others do not make or order.
They send The Voice in a first-rate manner because they want to offer as broad support as possible for their future.
The idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said I do not see why a tax programme is being financed, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is a program of this kind, but it is one that, admittedly, is both.
Other channels would give their right arm to other channels.
I am going to see how this is supposed to be television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for the series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the hunt for ratings because of the aspirations of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support.
Seine's comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts include what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, proposed in his home in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should sell as usual.
Johnson said that the more public public service should go to where they could not measure the audience, but they do meet their tasks, and they can argue when they go on their missions to justify £4 billion, Well, of course, we have created all of these programs that no one has seen.
They place them in a place where nobody ever wanted to see.
To the committee, Johnson said to the committee: I invite you to find a more uniform system in terms of conditions that can obtain the best value from this.
Of course, you all think we all think you have a great deal for £150 a year, but for people who spend a lot of money for the £150 £, I wonder if this is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former channel of David, who also took part in the committee of Tuesday on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC check its use, educate, and talk about it.
He said that little of the mix would now be officially classified as education - he said that it is 1% of their size and 0.1% on the radio - and that it should take an example of public service in Australia and Canada.
On the question of partnerships, it was said that the BBC should do more in areas like the one that he said only a handful on television, and with commercial channels, alliances, to make everything available online.
Profit by means of taxes by means of taxes
The video shows how to change direction at the moment when they are going to become available.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified crops that can be controlled by people who use them.
The tiny changes change the direction at the moment when they are going to be used with those who have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on those that are genetically modified to wear those that react to them.
Further one on this subject: Reading and writing researchers with light with light.
The researchers told us that the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called the one that can be used to activate a series of operations outside the body.
As the Guardian pointed out that the procedure could replace one day a day, it said to the Guardian that the procedure could replace one day, a process that makes electrical impulses into the brain of humans to treat the symptoms of the disease.
As a rule, it does not react to any of them, but it has been established that they did, when they were surrounded by a liquid that used to be surrounded.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ones that then enter the worms.
The increased use is based on structures that are called structures that are called structures that are known and can be found in some of them.
The latter makes the opening of these and activate the cells to which they are assigned, so a report is Nature Communications.
In order to make it possible for them to move forward, they have changed the worms so that some of them carry them.
If it is used to apply changed creatures, they will be reinforced and transmitted to the worms where they can switch on to the changed ones.
The procedure has some similarities to a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off with light of light.
But it has said that there might be some benefits to this technology.
In contrast to light that needs to be used on an optical fibre to the desired place in the brain, they can pass unhindered and be able to be sent to the brain from above.
We believe that with a therapeutic virus and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the human which is temporarily vulnerable to a clinical setting in a clinical setting for specific treatments.
Other applications could focus on use of small and medium cells, he added.

Eight Golden Rules for Living
Eleven years ago, I moved into a person who was still in love of moral and moral value in faith, but now I remember the smiling smiles of those whom I have - and the numerous complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be made in eight simple rules.
The entry into a product ranges from easy to absolutely terrifying.
It is something to tell people: People tell you where you come from, where you have taken part of where you stand and where you are talking about what you are talking about and why you don't love it.
What about you?
And help others to do the same - post questions and show interest.
ES directs the conversation and helps you to discover the people you like, unlike those you would not talk to, even if yours was set to fire and these people would be able to do so.
Let people be made public.
People who are people are often transformed into family of people who are active, but they are also the places where people are attracted.
In other words, do not think of starting with a relationship at university.
They receive a rough treatment at university.
Your room should be one, but many are friendly and friendly people who can lead to friendship.
This can be the hell for someone who is trying to get rid of himself.
Nothing in culture allows you to tell you that I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to come to receive the energy I used to interact with you.
Try to see when a good deal has been exhausted - and send an SMS to it instead of using it.
Something you can do: Do it.
One of the things I had in mind in my life was that an invitation was an invitation.
He saw a number of things.
Friendship ends by baking it.
Since you start the university at the height of the start, the person on the doors of people to imagine himself with a plate full of fancy, less strange than the welcome of the years to welcome in the neighborhood, I have something to do to you, and now please ask me if I ask you a few personal questions.
Offering a good way to make friends is a good way to make friends.
Your people are committed to maintaining themselves and, at the end of the day, making your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a commercial.
Low yield of flour, sugar and fat lead to people turning up when you use them.
Stealing food is a crime in terms of crime.
Of course, this is a theft, but is it a drop of a drop for your tea?
Make sure to check this.
The opportunities are good that they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside them.
If someone is your things to do, it is annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it better than mine, which is a custom to punish her milk in order to punish her milk.
It is now in prison.
They should make no noise, people from sleep or from work.
It is not just a matter of being a human being, but you literally belong to the people who are sitting in the office.
A girl on my floor asked her neighbors whether it is something they could do; it is three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with music that was still available.
When they finally came at 5 p.m., they kindly let their neighbors sleep another two hours before leaving their own music, to leave their door and go to their examination.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse were to become the same as the same?
Conversely, it would not be embarrassing if you think it is a good thing to stand aside for your future, separate it from it, and then see how all of the common friends can see each other?
Of course, the heart goes on its own paths - but if a hot is definitely not your future, try at least your good a little sanity.
At the very exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his key in his not room, the border between one of them is more fine than it seems.
A good one is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a reality.
Give you a valuable and exciting lesson about security - but you never have any room with a few of them.
Grab your door, and place your key in a glass of water that you then put into the table - but you do not see your hands on the ceiling more than it is twice.
Aid for refugees, those who are involved in peace
This is the case for people who do not have a lot of money.
So much for refugees, but also as a signal: We need not only refugees who need refugees, but also the mother and the family.
I show how to build cheap and well built today, says the interview in the interview in the interview.
Thousands of refugees will press for it.
The entrepreneur Markus also believes it is possible to know how quickly it can be created: It is based on a project for refugees for refugees.
Mr President, many refugees will press for the same.
What solution do you offer?
Markus: The accommodation in containers or the production of goods does not have sustainability.
Because people remain here to a large extent.
In view of this, we also need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
One of the most important things to do is to solve this problem.
Note: A minimum of space needs less space.
ES facilitates integration.
This is different when people are used in terms of employment.
Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each four asylum seeker.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
ES may be that many refugees will say it is again peace, I go back.
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs.
What are the costs?
Subject: The price of 160 square metres per house is EUR 184 000, without land.
That is easy to track.
Six months of construction has taken place.
That is appropriate.
Do the people have plans for their plans?
Note: I have my project to deal with my project correctly.
What makes it particularly complicated is that there is always the threat of a product that is threatened.
It is something that we need to do.
ES is still subordinated to who manages three apartments in one or two apartments, at least three spaces are required.
It is only in towns that there is no room for this.
Refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
What was the response to their response to their actions?
What I have been accused of is what I have been accused of creating for asylum seekers.
This is definitely not true.
But do you not increase the cost of residential flats?
What is true is that it is true that over the last five years, we have had a person in Germany, but we have built up very few people who can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, also ordinary people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the mother or the one alone.
I would like to see how we can continue to build better today.
That is what it is about.
Markus has 44 different degrees of study in Regensburg, and he first worked with him.
Volume 9: How do you get the new one if it is released?
The new operating system can be requested by choosing to go to the table, type it on top, and then select a product with a selection of items you wish to use.
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and install.
Some of them have encountered problems after installation, since they receive an error message that tells us that it has failed.
In order to deal with the problem, it is recommended for users to wait until the end or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
This might mean the deletion of apps in order to create space - but Apple has made this through the updates of the update, and it will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and reinstall them when the process is completed.
ES is worth it to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade, or that it is located near one of them so the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, since the phone might be half-way and this could lead to the termination of the update.
Note: 9 of them are still on schedule despite the delay in reviewing 9: The least exciting, but the best update of 9: 9: You are preparing for the new one.
You should also make sure you have all things you need before downloading our full set of things in order to prevent things from being wrong, if they bring new features, including a lot of personal assistants and enormous new ones for the iPad, as are changes that can be accelerated and the operating system to be repaired.

It is still unclear whether the current situation in Singapore will have an impact on the Great Price of Singapore.
For days it has depended on the city as a result of fires caused by fires.

This makes it possible to include those who cannot control it
They also need to be pushed forward.
What is desired is that membership in the form of membership and friendly contact with the customer will be seen as an expression of his attachment to the latter.
Looking for Direct Contact
Under the coat of arms and a new point of contact, a new point of contact opened up under the coat of arms and a new point of contact.
In addition to consultations we can also take part in courses.
It moves from the mountain to the city centre.
To be more precise, let us know what we are talking about.
A new one has been opened recently.
Here, right from the beginning, senior citizens now receive senior citizens as well as information on questions such as the or the services of the domestic and foreign companies.
For years now, we have been discovering with our aid that it is often people who are left to be left on their own.
There are an endless number of questions.
Also, many of the funds" benefits are not taken into account because the complexity of insurance is hardly yet understood, the new explained the new product which is also responsible for the production and service of the service of Amadeus, which is also responsible for the production and service of the service.
In addition to the consultations, the new business also offers prevention, rehabilitation and wellness.
This has been taken on board by this.
Therefore, it is possible to make use of additional offers such as residence, product, or treatment.
The offers of the product and the product complement each other ideally.
There is a need for prevention, prevention and action in this area.
Purpose for care and care of people who are interested in care and care, with regard to the treatment of patients who are able to take part.
The opening of the new business in the city centre shows both in terms of demographic change.
This will make good infrastructure in the various parts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, the Mayor of Germany, the Mayor of Germany and the president of Germany, is also one of those who are involved in this: It is also possible to take part in various events and offers on the program, and they invite you to become a regular.
This makes it possible for senior citizens to live as independently as possible in their own environments.

The match between the FC and Bamberg in the middle of Bavarian football against the club has now finally become permanent.
It is played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 19: 00 in the table.
We are glad that we now know when the game is going to take place, now we have something we know about it.
ES is for our team what is special to play against one.
We therefore hope to see numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because they have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC moved into the lap of 1: 1.
The winner of the competition gets 5000 euro and qualifies for the first round of the first round of the first round of 2016 in 2017.

Tim meadow in Bremen has been noticed in Bremen.
She was one of them, but in the meantime Tim has been involved in Germany and Bremen.
According to his own statement, he wants to have 30 kilos of food during the last two years.
He does not have anything to do with this.
In the centre of Bremen, it was possible to cut the hair when he saw how one of them saw it as one of his white.
Grass then returned from business, sent the married, and threw her the due fine before the feet like the picture reported by the photo.
The accusations are confirmed at the city of Bremen, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.

Panama authorities destroy 4500
The fertile ground and the climate of the island of Isla del Rey are best suited to this.

Men on Women on behalf of Afghans
Witnesses have been looking for the police for an incident in Bad Salzuflen: Three young men were on their way to the road on foot from Bad on the day of departure.
One of them, a group of 17 years of age, followed the police with his two friends in a distance of about five meters and called for them to wait for him.
At that point, the group was on the level of the individual.
On the site of the petrol station there were also three people.
One of these men now sustains young people and proposed it with the fist.
In this case, the victim suffered a great deal from his nose.
When his two friends made money on the racquet, he first left his victim.
From his friends, the injured young man was now brought home.
The author followed the group with a passenger car to their home and passed several times over time there.
When you no longer saw the vehicle, the injured was left in front of the building in order to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked by the racquet and another male person.
One of them is one of those on the face of a person and one of the victims of the victim.
The injured had to be brought to a hospital in order to supply them with care.
So far it is only vague.
One of the men was about two years old.
The second racquet was supposed to be big and was a pair of jeans.
The police are asking for witnesses and actions to register under the telephone number given by the police.
Dr. Frank Müller takes part in practice and invests Euro for Euro.
Silvia's and Frank Müller from left take over the practice of personal and business activities.
This is also something that we can look forward to as one of the founders of Bernd, one of them.
In many places in the country there are no doctors - one who is lucky: There Dr. Frank Müller takes part in practice on 1 October.
While she retires from retirement, her husband has half of his successor in the coming months.
According to a contract, Müller opens the practice on 12 October, by which time he invests Euro in the premises of the 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia, who are currently completing their work in the hospital, also want to take part in practice years ago.
When we had always in mind that the very good would fit well into this practice, says Dr and laughs at.
When it was so far, I simply called it.
The idea that was liked by the Müller couple was to pursue its own practice in future.
The proximity and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us, says the Muller.
We want to meet the families over the years and accompany them.
He also sees himself as an asset to being his own boss.
And so one was agreed that the house bought the house with practice.
However, housing will continue to be put in place.
This is where Frank Müller, who was born in Hannover, also grew up.
At present he is working as a partner and in 2009 he was appointed as a manager in the group and is actively involved in the project.
From September 19, the practice for the new boss will be prepared.
While he is working as a partner, his/her family has specialized in the field of business.
The two people who are involved want to settle for themselves.
When they come out of them, they say that's what they say.
After being renovated, the rooms will look more modern.
We are going to offer more, and we will offer more, and we need more.
What is more, data processing is being fully updated.
A total of EUR 1 000 has been awarded in the context of a contract within the framework of one of the municipalities of the district of EUR, Euro of EUR.
This shows how proud and delighted we are that the practice will continue, it emphasizes the practice of president Bernd.
About 2000 patients come to practice according to Silvia in each quarter, and there are about 500 in the market where they are about 500.
In addition to this, there is another one.
A positive impact of Frank Müller by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains in service according to the market.
If no successor had found it, she would have left.
By the way, anyone who visits one of them will continue to look in front of them.
This is an era that ends in an era which has been practised for 30 years.
Playing Am At the beginning we had only two rooms, it is reminiscent of a couple of years.
A little bit of a bit of life after the long time.
However, we live further in a few days and a lot of patients will probably still see a lot of them, they say they say.
Your husband adds to this: We have a very good one.
So far I have always been forced to press down, and now things could become different.
In addition, the pair has two children and will be happy to travel.
Croatia: We allow us to leave the refugees by means of a collection of refugees.
Now, Now the border controls are also going to be part of our production, Johanna said Johanna.
The controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to request asylum can also make this possible.
The focus is on the supply and security of people.
Although it is clear that it needs clear signals, the Minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept limitless migratory flows, even beyond the border.
ES requires a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering Comprehensive Corruption - Slovenia
The Croatian Government had previously told us that Slovenia also wanted refugees to Austria and Germany, and that corridors for the refugees could also be built.
So, in fact, this was not something this did not see, in terms of business, in terms of production.
The idea of a country that is totally unacceptable is totally unacceptable, but Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border, particularly with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the country.
As the Minister has pointed out, this means that it does not want to limit the borders of refugees.
It is necessary to fill out its obligations, otherwise the system cannot operate
As the Croatian Government announced, the first refugees had already tried on Tuesday to move to the border crossing on the border crossing over the border, in order to register the registration.
The Croatian police were able to take up them in the Middle East.
According to local media, people in Croatia constantly meet with new refugees.
ES is mainly a question of both men and women, including a large number of women and children.
Even the Red Cross and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country will be waiting for about 4000 refugees, and home affairs ministers will have a chance to take part.
In addition, buses from vehicles on the border that had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border would be redirected towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, is that it is people who are willing to take certain routes: We can do it, still we want to do this, was called it.
According to the plan, at least in the case of a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian territory of sid, in the course of the day, in the course of the day, more buses would be expected.
Via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria after Germany
The inmates had been on the road of the border of Serbia all the night from the border of Serbia which was about 500 kilometres away.
What we have heard is that Hungary has been taking part in Hungary, so the police have told us that we are supposed to drive here, and one of the refugees said.
They wanted to go further to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
As a result, it might now be possible for the observers already to move to a slightly further west of the country as it has done to date.
Croatia: Extensive Options for All Who Are
Croatia's Minister for Home Affairs has previously stressed that his country has prepared for the case of a strong refugee of refugees for possible future plans.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia had extensive possibilities to use it.
Strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership.
Slovenia has been listening to this since 2007, and this is a good testimony to the country which relates to the standard of border controls.
On the side there are still about 300 refugees who remain behind Hungary.
According to them, they would have spent the last night on the border pass that leads to the border of the country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, both of them remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now wish to become part of the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Minister for Home Affairs tried to reassure a person who was still in a position to reassure him: He considers that the debate on refugee status seems to me to be too early to take place on the subject of the occupation of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed.
It would not be very high as it is at present.
It is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Aid workers discourage migrants, and they are dangerous.
However, private Hungarian people have already begun to distribute the refugees, which are alternative routes through Croatia, to refugees.
However, there is no danger between Serbia and Croatia: In parts of the budget there is still 20 years after the end of the trade.
On the record, the Croatian police announced that a team was sent from a team in the service.
Profit: Ukrainians pay $30 million
He is said to have heard of a ring of people who have been accused of repeatedly gaining access to still available news and press releases on sites such as Business Wire, PR and PR since 2010.
Information about this should have been made on financial markets.
As a result, more than $100 million have been spent on it as a whole.
Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught, that is to say at the same time.
The trials against 32 more in the case.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are to have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe.
For 20 years, Mannheim, Germany, has been in operation since 20 years.
There is a great deal of activity to deal with.
People do their work in a partially fast manner, and in some cases they are comfortable.
They tax the two stations of the project at the end of the day.
Let us stick to this.
I would like to say something I would like to know, with the title of four large panels with the title of four large panels with the headline I would like to go.
This action has drawn attention to this action and faces mixed reactions.
It is about life, so we are with the action in the middle of the city and among people, he says.
The head of the family is available to passers-by for questions and for conversations like the employees.
While some people spontaneously pick up their way and read the sentence to read my life of my life, they can read with the camper by the USA, war stop the war or keep others short, others remain short, read rates like that I am not yet active, and then go further.
Time and again, on the margins of small discussions about action, about life, dealing with dying.
Peter is also present on the spot.
When I make it clear to me that for me, the end of this world, I can live responsibly, the director of the Mannheim work says.
This is why this is a good thing to do.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables, it is understandable that it is a very personal matter.
The issue of death and death is still taboo, and this is the experience of work on the part of people, although it is precisely the latter that have contributed a great deal in recent years to opening up people.
This is an assessment that Angelika shares.
The latter is part of the first hour of service.
Through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to become involved.
When she was searching for a call to call her, she contacted him immediately and had been with us when it was founded in 1995.
It is part of a team of 45 people - 43 women and two men - who are accompanied by a person in private households, hospitals, the labour market and the Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences that have been achieved.
When I see life from another, it seems to me the moment of love and treasure, says it.
The offer of the product is free and free of charge.
The financial support of the contributions and contributions of relatives and associations enables the training, as well as the development of the relationship between the two and the individual.
Every two years, training courses for new people are offered.
The panels described on Saturday are now on display in the house of the office of the office of the church of the band called M1, 1a and in the house of the Catholic Church.
It is also possible to take note of other personal wishes on postcards.
Mixed, Changing for 2016
It reports results for the last quarter, and the number of people who have been involved in this for an entire year is due to the weaker demand for higher and higher costs in his/.
The company also said that she plans to make about three years of holiday for holiday.
At this time last year, it announced that the company wanted to set 50,000 for the next year.
The share price fell by 2.5% in about 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
As he said, he said it would make a profit between $1 and $1 in the fiscal year that ends in May next year, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
According to a survey, analysts expected to expect $2.
Despite the price increases, which are estimated to be average per cent per year, it will take effect on January 4, despite higher premiums for heavy and large packages that will be collected as of November.
The company said that it still expects the result to increase compared with the prior year as a result of cost reduction, higher revenue, and growth in terms of growth.
Fred Smith, Chairman and CEO, has said that the company will yield solid returns, that it will take into account the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and retail trade.
The plans for the have been announced a day later as announced by the rival UPS, which plans to set the same number as in the last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, it earned $1 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $1 per share, just under $1 per share, 12 out of investment research.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $1 billion.
Six of them expect billions of dollars worth $1 billion.
In recent years, there has been a decrease in international sales, which has brought sales in its unit to the market.
But the boom in aid has increased its results in terms of ground ground.
Sales rose by 29 percent in the last quarter, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and applications.
The revenues rose due to higher prices, while the result fell in proportion due to the higher cost of labor.
In the, about one hour before the opening, the $to $$, or 2.5%, on $200.
On Tuesday, they ended with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a budget of 11 June.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve spend two days this week around an estimated to decide whether it is time to lift it up for the first time in nearly a decade.
Talking about them at an end of the medium, this is a United States of America.
The card is a reminder that Janet L. and her colleagues want to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The central bank has a mandate to order from Congress: Maximizing prices here is stable.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed has acknowledged that there is a third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate might be the one that could be in a decision that is too narrow to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is poised to become a target of unprecedented incentive through the near-zero interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008.
While most economic data show that they are growing solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious ways of strengthening this volatility by increasing the size of the economy - even if it is about a quarter.
Labor market will become the labour market, and inflation will be the most important thing they observe, it said M. It said, and it was one of those who used it as a result of the actions of the people who used it.
But I think if they were looking for a pretext for not raising the interest rate, the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting, she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which is in itself the financial market.
About half of the economists who were recently surveyed by government predicted this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to become involved, with only 30% of an increase in an increase.
This implies a decline in the price of the Fed if the Fed increases the rate unless it is promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial jumped from points of view or by 1.4%.
The action was caused by expectations that the set of the sentence this week was taking place, said John, business at Moody Capital Markets Research Group.
I would be a surprise if the Fed would lift the rates at that time, he said.
If they do, they would have to go very far in their statement in order to reassure the financial markets so that they do not panic.
Other experts have thought that it would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to increase the rate by percentage points this month, which would be the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
It was true that in spring and last they said that this year, despite liberals' complaints, more economic progress would be required, and that is what we expect to see increased.
Although job creation took place in August, improvements in the labour market were solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to last month's average of last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the Fed considers to be full employment.
Signs of recovery have shown signs.
And, although inflation continued to fall below the 2% ratio of the central bank, it was said that the main reason was the effect of a much lower rate of action.
The economy can cope with higher interest rates, and it needs it because of the labor force on the labour market, said Ian, working at Pantheon.
But financial markets around the world joined together at the end of last month after China had its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial fell by more than 16% in May, as investors, that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would increase global growth.
The market has recovered a little this month, and the Dow is now nearly 10% below May.
For those who use them, they influence the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
When the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks would not have occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract a lot of effort at this meeting, said Stephen D., Senior Research Fellow at the Comprehensive Center for Real Estate and a former United States" Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least one month to get to grips with the impact.
There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China, saying it has been said.
The health of the world economy is not the Fed's primary concern, so it should not be taken into account when it comes to their decision-making.
But the bottom line is that the Fed has become world class.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of what was then known to Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 is that the Fed was able to trigger its expansion of its expansion of its expansion into China, which took place around the world around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, they can be expected to be expected not only to compete in other places, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Your decision-making is more art than science, he said, and director of global strategy for the marketing of the company based Inc.
Jeffrey, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, remarked this month that the Fed has had a history of housing that does not appear to be associated with economic growth.
As an example of this, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, cited decisions in 1998 as an example in 1998.
A financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to reduce its target by percentage points in three meetings despite a limited impact on growth in the US, saying it.
A year later, the latter reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first during a severe crisis like that of 2008, said Adam S. Poznań, member of the Committee on the Bank of England.
The recent turmoil does not come near this level, he said.
Certainly, you do not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of finding a job, because the markets are involved in business, which said Poznan, president of the Institute for International Economics, said.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until this is changed, I do not believe that it should take place time.
Do you need a great deal?
Try it out in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market was opened in 1997 and is owned by Inc., Inc.
It is often referred to as Thai and is one that is also sold to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market is a central point of contact and it offers a number of fresh and original products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and tableware, furniture, religious jewellery, as well as dishes.
ES even gives one of them if you need it.
The store is huge, and it takes more than one hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole thing makes you successful, there is a meal for you in the family BBQ Express.
The cost of buying goods at reasonable prices in this store is close to the coffers and has various options.
What there is here: You need something - something - something?
It is likely to be one of them.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and more.
The range is extensive, also the people behind the staff will clean the fish, and even on request for you it is possible.
A good part of the product belongs to the mass of people who are involved in this, as well as all of them, whether they are people who are willing to participate, people who are willing to participate.
Anyone who is buying here is one who buys, as well as individual families and individuals.
The wide range of gears is suitable for use on both sides.
You will find here: There is a fresh start of the market next to the cash desk.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial estate of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and the city centre - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: It is possible to have an own of your own, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well attended, it is not difficult to find a parking place.
Safe: Small family of refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany during these days.
To give you a warm welcome, it is not without engagement that you have a warm welcome.
There are also a number of people who support asylum seekers in the city.
They belong to Petra and Klaus.
Petra is a teacher with heart and soul.
She is still happy to teach her 74 of her.
Every Thursday, she does it at the end of the road.
It helps to help refugees from hospitals, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from that of a proper school.
Brazil's Society of Rio Grande promotes nutrition for a good sense of well-being.
The Brazilian organisation is trying to inform women about the importance of good nutrition while it is, with the presentation of pictures of babies who suck in the case that is used with images of food products.
It consists of a multitude of products, fats, vitamins and products that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
As a result of the additional benefits, young mothers and young mothers will be allowed to increase their daily average by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher level is not the only adjustment that should be made by mothers.
A recent study conducted by Robert E., a professor at the College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet really affects the genes of their babies and protects them from development of them.
Unfortunately, a child's diet can adversely affect the immune system.
The Exceptions for New Deal
The latter approved the cost of the EUR 2.3 million for the EUR 2.3 million.
And it made an exception.
The roof of the roof is allowed to be used for the purpose of making it possible.
The plans for the long term used to move forward on the market are making progress: The most recent one was unanimous in terms of the work that has been drawn up without much discussion.
Before that, the Board decided among other things to make a request for an exemption from the valid case for an exception to the case of an exemption from the current situation.
In the case of exception, it was permission for a person with respect to the family.
This is why we want to set up a home with first and second hand.
The background of the planning is the intended use of the intended use of the purpose of use for the purpose of being able to work: Thus we get a wonderful big deal together together, Mayor Josef Steigenberger stated at the meeting.
When it came to freedom of movement, it was again about those who, for energetic reasons - unlike in the case of change - should be below ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
This is why it is necessary to exempt them from this because they do not allow any exceptions with regard to the number of people who wish to take part.
However, this is not a project: We do not create a precedent that is so important to us.
One of the things to do with this is the involvement of the community and the SV.
The cost of this is around EUR 2.3 million.
They are expected to receive aid from the people who are willing and able to do so.
In the next one, the hall for the 18 x 36 meters will now be presented to the test for consideration.
Clinic Comes to Later
The hospital is expected to be closed at a time when it is planned to be closed - 2016.
At the same time, Dr Wilhelm Fischer will become a director of 66 with new director at the hospital.
The station as well as the majority of staff move from time to time.
This is due to the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the person who confirmed Andrea on her own.
However, a decision on this is made by the Supervisory Board, and it will be held on Wednesday, 23 September.
If plans are implemented, all of the 50 people at the hospital would be in the hospital.
The vast majority should move from one to another with fishermen and the existing inner station.
The rooms are there.
The staff who cannot get into business in work should be offered in work in work as a job
The staff are informed of the plans.
Since the beginning of the beginning of the year, Dr. Andreas who is director of the hospital has changed since the beginning of the year.
When it comes to the question of where the succession is to take place, according to the name of the name, it has come into play when it comes to the game which, as of 1 October, is ready to take place from 1 October to October.
For the house in favor of this this in any case a revaluation of value and one of the offer in the area of internal medicine would be able to take place.
Fischer is a specialist in the field of communication and communication.
More than 180 beds are specialized at the interior of the inner station.
For the next two years, with his team when the Supervisory Board agrees, fishermen with their team intend to close the former hospital of the former hospital, which still has 35 beds, after almost 140 years.
Up to now, this was planned for 2018 when the current renovation of the hospital is completed.
What happened is that the house which is in possession of the present is expected to be used as an accommodation for use in the future.
How the property goes on, it was impossible to say that there are a number of ideas.
At present there are a few of them and one of them.
What better we could not do, such an opportunity does not come back again, according to which fishermen have been admitted to the Lech, which has been favourably received by the employees in positive and very terms.
There has been no real prospect of the House where fishermen have been working for more than 30 years.
He has been asked by colleagues to take over the post of director.
The hospital that once had 100 beds was threatened in recent decades by the threat of closure, departments were closed, for example surgery was closed.
The figures of the lions lions are asking for at the time of day evening are demanded at the estimated HC.
Although there is no doubt about the success of the Bundesliga in Wuppertal, no one has any reason to attend.
In the last season, the number of people who received a painful defeat at the end of the season has something to say about it.
Two wounded with two wounded
Two of them have been seriously injured when they reach their homes.
As the police announced, a number of hunters have been involved in the case of a person who has been involved in a project that is based on a relationship with a group of people who represent more than one party.
After one, a woman and a man suffered severe injuries and was brought to hospitals.
It was unclear how exactly it was possible for the accident to take place.
That is what is being investigated.
Marketing of victims of violence from victims of violence
One of them has led the police to carry out the service that has been taking place since Saturday.
In addition, there was the idea of killing young people and throwing them into a channel in a channel.
One who has fallen into victim since Saturday has fallen to a victim.
The youth of the young woman was found on the occasion of the day of the day when it was found, such as the office of prosecutor and the police on Wednesday.
This is also something that is also valid in the case of a person who is involved in the event which, according to what is stated, has led to the arrival of a person who has been able to move to the point of view.
On the day of the day, on the eve of a visit to a factory, it was reported that they were missing when they arrived at home on the eve of a visit to the home.
When looking for the young woman, they first encountered personal objects of the victim.
Finally, when it comes to the case of people who live in and those who live abroad, there was a case against the one that was used against it.
The perpetrator then led the police to a channel where they were found.
According to the authorities, the authorities admitted that they were killed and that they had put them in the Channel.
It should be presented on Wednesday to the person who is taking part in it. This is a burden on him.
What is more, it is important for us to investigate the further investigations.
Refugees who need accommodation: Study warns of the need for a study of goods.
The situation on the German is something we need to know.
More and more refugees are also seeking a situation.
Pressure on it is growing.
Social housing faces a challenge.
The people on the German market have already begun a long time ago.
More and more people are pushing to a market which is already overstretched in many large cities.
They compete with citizens of the last few housing estates.
In order to cover demand for housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020.
This is the result of a study on behalf of the project to buy residential housing.
Comparison: This year, units operating in Germany will be completed.
This means that there is a lack of housing.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers after the first three months of their stay.
Many of them then face the long queues on top of the long queues.
According to the Federal Office, however, in the year after year, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent.
However, the negative development of the budget is not only of increasing importance.
The study also makes considerable shortcomings in recent years.
Germany is producing a similar pattern which is larger from year to year.
At present, there was a lack of residential units already missing in the event, Matthias Günther, author of the study.
This is why many people lived in large cities in a number of cities.
Young adults remained in the hotel for longer in the hotel because of the number of people who took part in the event.
In large cities, the figure of square meters per head in recent years has fallen again for the first time.
In order to resolve the problem, the alliance proposes to restart housing.
New incentives are intended to revive social housing.
This would mean that they would be abandoned and that the housing for supported flats would be suspended.
Moreover, according to the alliance, attractive tax breaks are needed.
It is already good for cities and municipalities to make use of this for the needs of cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the EUR 300 million at its disposal of EUR 184 million was retrieved.
Now the project could be increased.
Refugees have free access: Croatia and Slovenia are establishing a corridor.
After Hungary, virtually no more is available, as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will grant the aid via Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
But the route is dangerous, however.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a refugee for refugees.
I have spoken with the Slovenian one, and when it is necessary to organise a corridor, the Croatian Home Affairs Minister said it would be possible to organise a corridor.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria, and it is already part of it.
Croatia, which is EU, is not yet able to do so.
After the border of the border, hundreds of refugees are transferred to Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border when they reach the border, the Croatian reports RTL.
On the previous day, Hungary had its border for refugees.
New laws that entered into force on the same day also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary superfluous.
Croatia wants to allow the refugees to happen.
The Croatian Prime Minister said this: It is possible for you to take action, and we are preparing for that possibility.
These people are there; they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, ES are people who do not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police took up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to Croatia's border.
According to most of them, they come from Afghanistan, Iran, and Afghanistan.
They came both to the bus and to the Serbian version of the Serbian.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to cross the green border to Croatia.
On the border, the refugees do not encounter anything like this.
There are other dangers to this: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Now they are supposed to create a safe passage now.
After Hungary, however, very few refugees come after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted people who were in prison.
Shortly before Monday, there were still a lot of work to do on Monday.
The new Hungarian laws introduce the possibility of overcoming and damaging the crime as a crime.
This is why 35 criminal proceedings have been initiated in the case of the use of 35 criminal proceedings.
They are sentenced to a sentence of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the latter, on Tuesday, a total of 94 asylum applications was accepted on Tuesday at the border with 94 applications, of which almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition.
Among these, there are 13 families with little children, as well as two older people.
On average, 40 refugees would have been detained there.
In practice, however, no one has any idea of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
According to Serbia's opinion, Serbia is a third country that is a third country.
It is important for asylum seekers to become involved.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the one hundred and fifty refugees who came into existence.
In the presence of workers began labor with them.
They collected the waste that people had left behind in recent weeks in recent weeks.
They have been reduced and one of them converted into one of them.
No one wanted to speak on the goal of this.
Following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria will reach only a few refugees.
The country has also reinforced its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants stayed in the country after they were still in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people wait for Germany to come to Germany.
The trip from there to Germany was stopped by instructions of the German authorities in the morning.
In addition, smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot on a regular basis.
Mayor over the border over the border
What we were talking about after Sunday on Sunday, when ten people at the entrance of the estate were at the entrance of the house, was suddenly the mayor of Alois.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because on Sunday, Germany on Sunday had surprisingly ended up with Austria, it was for them in an end to the end of the day, in such a way that he immediately came to the border with the border of Passau, immediately giving his help to him and her along with two others and their cars.
Prior to that we first have guests with drinks and drinks.
We say we bring them to Passau by car.
This was something we were in favour of doing, and that was something we know about it.
They were very grateful.
A man could not take it to give a generous donation - 100 euro for the fire brigade.
This is something that we were delighted to see.
At the end of the day, an ICE from one to another was in an ICE to Passau to try it out after the short term that it was stopped by Germany, though it was still trying to cross the border.
However, it was placed in front of the border of the Inn before the border.
In terms of mobility, this is generally high on a regular basis.
The association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was previously a sport - organized by the Union by the Union and Bavaria.
That Viktor Orbán is now sending more to us is a result of a policy of policy:
Instead of immediately helping to set up structures in the camp immediately when building structures, our German Chancellor has put the position of the Hungarian Government in the hands of National Socialism.
None of this policy are the Austrians who are now facing chaos with chaos.
It is also important to note that the country of residence that has invited it and welcomed it is nothing but another refugee camp.
ES is going to be a big challenge, in view of the ongoing growth and winter of winter, to produce humane conditions for use with us.
And it will be even greater - peace, security and stability in Austria.
The Konrad in the Search for Facts of Enlargement
Konrad has every hand to do with the hands of the people.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word.
The government has used the former powerful to establish itself for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in terms of business has already been put to the attention of Konrad.
Move We do not have any more in usable, he reported of his first success, he reported.
Also the accommodation of the 20 000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday has taken place without great deal, Konrad said, and he was responsible for the organisation of organizational work.
The latter, on the other hand, spoke of a situation in which there was a situation in which there was a situation.
In total, Konrad expects a need for last year's budget.
In order to meet the number, we need to find accommodation in the coming weeks - 20,000 to supply the countries, 15,000 of the covenant.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it is not a barrel without bottom, said Konrad." said Konrad.
He has already had talks with the latter.
They would have promised him that he would still have something to do for the next refugees.
If you want to know what you are looking for, you need to know what you are looking for.
The former was supported by Konrad.
In the morning there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph, it is to become part of how the church will help.
Great expectations also help to help those who use it, as we do it.
On the platform private individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
We also hope to see hotels that are empty in winter.
The standards for housing were very high yesterday in the case of Konrad and yesterday, yesterday.
In some cases it is impossible for them to be able to comply with a certain level of size or size of the individual.
For a temporary period of time, it would be necessary for us to apply the same to those which need to be taken into account.
The fact that he is more successful when it comes to housing is based on Konrad and his experience.
I am an older gentleman who cannot be told about this without another
It is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Participants of the Republic do not incur costs which they themselves declared.
They want to increase them to three to four.
It has not yet been successful on its own.
Konrad wanted to place a container at the office as an office.
However, there appear to be problems with approval.
Calling for a better distribution of Linz
For the time being, the city of Linz does not open up the opening of the city and other buildings such as the city of residence and the design centre for the accommodation of refugees.
This is not necessary at present, because at present it is impossible for people to be accommodated without these measures, it is said that Mayor Klaus says he is using the SP.
In case of emergency, however, further locations are to be examined for their use.
Criticism of the involvement of the refugees in the distribution of refugees within the building.
Other districts also have to contribute.
Limits: Borders with borders will not be allowed to cross borders
In a longer period when the prime minister, Horst, gave his name, on Monday, he had a further course of action at the end of the day.
I have been reassured by the fact that the German borders will not be allowed.
It is still possible to continue to deal with refugees into the Federal Republic.
However, it is precisely the appropriate border controls that exist.

However, they would be brought to Germany with regular trains.

The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were rebuilt.

The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that even those who are at home in Bologna were impressed by the idea of their own site where only their goods were sold.
We are the only one in the greater of Linz that sells this brand, it says the mother of two who personally has Italian roots.
Her mother was born from her mother in the cradle.

It was a film that turned into a film about life.

But the lives of grandparents were not free: Their desire to return to their homes in the long term failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He did not accept it because he was once without permission, and the director of the Institute for History, Roland Paul, declared that he would be speaking.
It is true that there is a need for the creation of an illegal trade which is illegal.
This is in contrast to what are sometimes signs of descendants.
This has repeatedly been spoken by Mexican immigrants in the United States, and has called for the construction of an illegal immigrant to deal with illegal immigrants.

Does he think that is the time to come?
I cannot imagine that, I tell me that is
It has never been a question of what he has done.
Like some of the people who took part in a visit to the Heinz during a visit to the Heinz, it was mentioned that one of the founders of the Heinz had something to do with this.
What I can imagine, the Donald does not imagine, says the.
It would be better if he did not vote for the election because one of them has such radical views, I do not know if that is good.
If those who had said this in the United States at the time would have been like him, he would never have had anything to do with it.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who is he going to choose?
What on earth does it reveal?
Whoever wins The Bachelor may have a degree in Lana, Sarah.
The woman in which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was kept in greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining will certainly not be able to tell whether she is the one who received the last Rose.
But when we took the day with Sarah, both of them and Lana on the day before going to three two, you might have inadvertently given you a hint about who will be the one.
Sam Wood keeps his lips until the final of Thursday.
All three women have left out on top of why Wood is the perfect man to call his sense of humor, ambition, positive and positive attitudes as reasons why they like to be their partner.
However, when the question is asked, if it is not you who should get a last Rose of Woods, her answers might become to who won the heart of the.
Both of them quickly called both - other than themselves - as the best partner for wood.
Sarah and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one.
Talking From the moment when I went to the house, and from the time I noticed it, I realized that they were pretty compatible, and I thought that was meant during the entire course of the show, said it.
If Sarah is on both feet on earth, it makes so much fun, combined with it, added more.
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable to each other.
Sarah believes that they would be good as a pair of Sam Wood.
From her point of view, he said that the last week made it clear that wood could be one of the A.
When I saw it with my friends and the family, it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now fully opposed to it, as she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not, she was going to vote.
I do not know if I can say that can say, she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a relationship between the and the Lana.
The Bachelor is broadcast on 10 on Wednesday, 19: 30 on Wednesday.

It had several options to start its work.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest when they moved to the USA - and there were many other teams that asked questions after its impressive open meeting at the end of last year.
But he chose the San Francisco and coach Jim, and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banished some of the rest of the game to the bank when it lost one of them as it did during his first day on Tuesday when he won the victory against Minnesota.
However, he gave birth to his husband, and gave the next opportunity to one and also to the current game after a violation of Bush.
It continued to show his true face in the game after the game.
Instead of putting his before the rest of the team through the mill, he made them.
He was also publicly involved in his press conference at his press conference.
He reported that he was also encouraged by Thomas, who was also encouraged to forget about his/her catch and take care of the next game.
It has been successfully restored to a volume that has been restored in the first edition of Minnesota.
ES was certainly not the start, the effort and the massive Australian that had hoped for his retirement.
He left the field after playing the playing field, and later told the Australian Radio Duo & Andy on record that he did not get a worse start to his/her own he thought he could imagine.
What happened was a thing that happened now, one cares about the next game, and that is what it said.
When a pass was made with its origin in 2007, it was a passport that led to one that could be used as one of those who contributed to it.
Despite this, it has been a great experience for the whole family.
Buy a photo for a photo with fans and keep an Australian flag after the game and keep it on his or her own.

Asylum seekers want to bring free voters as soon as possible.
This is why more people demanded more staff for those who are responsible for them: We also need at least 50 new jobs we have said, and that is what we say.
What was critical was that several states were not consistent: That we needed uniform standards for the federal states across Germany.
While Bavaria is shifting from one another to another, others do not.
What do we have to do about it?
However, they do not want to come under the table for the purpose of falling below the table.

According to a new study, the benefits of a new study for simple people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years.
It is still too early to say whether it is possible for patients with diabetes to live longer than those who receive treatment.
What is needed is a long time to show something, saying Dr. Robin, an expert of the one who wrote a new study to the new study.
Use different methods to reduce the size of the product.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability to absorb food.
Over the years, it has proven to be efficient for treatment to be treated as efficient, but most studies have been carried out among people who are 35 or higher patients with a 35 or higher BMI.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between one and another.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is active, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered to be active.
You can calculate your BMI here: This is a case of an increase in the size of your BMI.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan used data for data that they have gathered since 2007 in a study, and compare two types of one and two types of medical treatment for people who were easy to use.
The average BMI, which underwent this operation, sank from 31 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
BMI remained among those who received an equivalent of 29.
Among those who were subjected to surgery, 36% of the total rose by 28%.
In comparison with this, the group was able to cope with only one percent of diabetes and, in some cases, only about two percent.
In addition, the results in inspections of the product, which is generally better in the case of a surgical group of patients who have been less than usual was found by the authors.
The researchers also included the one which is the same as the one which is reflected in the course of time.
The best way to keep it below 7% is to write the researchers.
After the operation, the average level has fallen from around 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In medical terms, however, it remained stable around 8 percent.
But this better control of control - as you reflected in the improved level of level - did not reduce it in five years, according to which the senior researcher, Dr, and his colleagues, were reduced.
This is also the average result for two types of surgery.
In the fifth year the ratio in comparison to the increased weight has lost more weight, compared to more than 100% in BMI, larger amounts in BMI reached 5.1% against 2.1%.
While the new study does not show surgery to surgery after five years, there are indications from a study by people in Sweden that leads to longer lives, and at the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, in comparison to a group that tried to die, it was people who were subjected to a 29% reduction in the number of people, about 29% less likely to die over the course of 15 years.
Although the new study showed no benefit to survival in terms of survival, it said that it was comforting for people with a BMI below 35 to be interested in the procedure.
What is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation is lower in this low, is without increased risk of death or one who said it said.
He added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously when the patient is between 27 and 30.
I think I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously, they said.
I think that once they have these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies to obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult to reverse them.
Playing In the Rise

It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe - Dalai Lama - A
Europe could not accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the Middle East is.
The leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke of the problem of continuing to meet in the United Kingdom at the beginning of his visit to the United Kingdom on the occasion of the inauguration of the Dalai Lama Centre in Oxford in Oxford.
He requested that, in the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also pointed out that the response of Western European countries to those who were involved was less than that, though the situation is not appropriate.
It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe, he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a solution.
Caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions such as real peace and real development, mainly through education, for which these Muslim countries can be created, he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
Managing The application of force has never solved these problems, he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke of the problem of violence, and also said that George Bush's actions were after the 11 September 11 th, and revealed that the violent reaction of the United States has shifted to a chain of events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way forward is in terms of solving this problem.
I know his motives were good, but he implemented violence, and this has unexpected consequences provoked by the Dalai Lama, the Dalai Lama.
Increase in the intake of family by children over the last 4 years
In the United States, there are reports of an almost total increase in the number of children under the age of twelve, who swallow a lot of alcohol, according to Georgia.
According to Dr. ĐLopez, director of Georgia, the cases of revenue from children under the age of 12 increased from time to time, from 2010 in 2010 to 2010 in 2014.
Children coming to these products are getting more and more frequent, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the car, said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink intentionally drink deliberately, while some do it to impress their friends, or because of a situation of social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink only because of a cheap drink.
Young people have allegedly mixed up with a lot of people to get a drink.
Younger children can become the most attractive of them.
One child's mind does not think that this is bad for it, said Lopez.
Many of them are those who are active.
There are a few of them which are very attractive to children.
They contain between 45% and 95% of alcohol.
Especially in the case of young children, few people can lead to this.
What makes it possible is that it is possible for us to know what it is.
So, you would not leave whisky to a whisky, but people leave it within the reach of children, and if children come to it, then it is a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Mr. Russell, a girl who had recently taken four of her to school in school, was brought to the hospital for treatment.
Your figure was 179, twice higher than the threshold that applies to an adult by law, as stated by Dr. Chris, who treated them in the medical centre outside Atlanta.
Cut their words, and was not able to go when they were in the business.
Doctors who took them on night in a separate to signs of consumption, as the girl had fallen by alcohol and had turned his head, said it.
When it was a very busy, it was said, said Scott, the mother of CNN.
ES would have been fatal for my child to be fatal.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use products or services and store them outside the scope of the child.
In addition, a number of deaths have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after the deal that contained toxic, non-return of goods.
Employees of industry suspect that the product contained a product that contained a solution to a solution which was not listed as a drug which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth class in New York State, by sending them products around the family, reports a deal.
The teacher is highly used against her and she is left out of her room.
The police regarded the plan as being part of the plan, and pointed out measures to be taken to the public.
Three vehicles: Three vehicles
In a case where there is a difference between the one and the other, a car driver has been easily injured in a case of a person who is responsible for it.
One of them drove on the road to roundabout industrial area and belatedly realized that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, with his truck running into the rear of a truck, he put this vehicle on top of a Ford Fiesta before that.
On the vehicles that came from around EUR 10 000, the police are sharing this.
The Audi of the race was no longer one of them and had to become one.

It is the talk of talking about Celtic Glasgow, it is possible to admit that there is a poor place to stop, but that is what he is going to do.
Hearts will be fought by means of fighting against them and those who are careful with regard to those who could destroy the unity of the species.
Increasing leadership over Celtic to five points.
In the first half of the year, Adam gave Aberdeen a brief victory over Hamilton, making it possible for them to create a relationship between themselves and Celtic.
Playing Talk About Home
There are rumours about this of Celtic Glasgow, which has been rejected spontaneously by people who insisted that he and his family are not kept under increased control as they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch.
I do not think we feel under pressure, I think the players look forward to this.
The Minority of Scotland in Scotland - The Hague
The former and earlier of the Netherlands Ronald de has said that Dutch interest has been lost to Celtic, as there is no such thing as any of them.
At present an ambassador for Ajax said: In Holland she does not show any of the highlights of the more than more, and why?
ES is because the two are not there.
People are not just talking about the return of the latter.
You talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the crowd, and it is not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games.
I am going to have things like things that are going to happen.
It was accepted that Celtic had to fight, but the Norwegian chief had to fight things.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit of the Champions League, the defeat against Aberdeen followed, which are now clearly at the top of the table with five points.
As he said, Celtic had already had a bad time and we will come back.
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel the same - but we must continue.
We really do need to really support Celtic, because that makes the player better.
Now it is important for us to do so.
Keeping It Right when it comes to Home
Despite his comments only a few weeks ago, which require that he should have a few of those involved in the signing of a good deal, he is wary of signing the law and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the race.
One of the things that has been said is that it is very different from what is going to happen.
The players who come in summer have this opportunity to integrate what you saw with our own group during this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Production of Made with Home
When talking to Celtic during the conversation, he has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract expires at the end.
For two years now, it has been active for two years and it has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts on Contracts for comments that have been made
The latter resulted in 2: 1, when the field was sent from the field, and then 3: 2, but the red card of the was later lifted - the third Red card of that which was revoked in eight months.
What he said, he continued to insist on what he said: I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance.
Getting It Wrong To avoid
After having sung one of the songs he wrote, it became possible for him to sing a song that was written with texts about whom Rudi was playing.
The incident occurred in a record in Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in March 2014.
It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the drink, said it said, and it added: It is certain to say that I do not play by means of use when it does not play for Celtic Glasgow.
Governing Supervisory Board has Confidence in Bain
Simon Donnelly insists that the Board of Management has confidence in the ability to rotate things, but it admits that it has to end on the playing field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We will bring the boys back on track, said Donnelly.
It is happy that it is won against Hamilton against Hamilton.
It is clear that his team from Aberdeen was desperately struggling against Hamilton to see a seventh consecutive year that gave them a lead of five points in front of Celtic at the top of the table due to Adam in the first half of the year.
He said: "There is no team that won everything, but it is not a team that won either of them.
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while in the United Kingdom it is increasing.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period from May to July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10 000 to €million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate was 5.5%, as indicated by figures for National Statistics Office.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with which the number of employees fell at a time.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 1% of GDP - a figure above the figure of 3%.
The Secretary of State for Scotland, David, has said the latest figures, and said that the government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.
It is almost exactly a year when Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment.
What Wrong to Run
As the situation was unable to cope with the situation, the police called the police.
It was only with the use of people who were able to take them into action.
One of them was one that gave rise to a situation in which there was a lot of work.
His mother was picked up by his mother.
One of them had something to do with it, and was initially in the making.
Why I am witnessing a situation in Oklahoma.
A little later today, except for late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.
When it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will sit in one of those sitting in a home in the Oklahoma State if Richard is going to become part of the trip.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day became closer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I voted because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
ES would offer a unique perspective.
ES is true that journalists can see executions in the United States, and since more applications are often available as seats, a lottery takes place in order to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of people from 12 to five.
Who is selected, it will observe it.
I cannot do that
In addition to Richard, I shall be sitting in front of a friend, with whom I have been going to develop my own relationship over the months with a visit and two and a half hours.
I like it.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so so it does not allow me to record a pen with a pen for things that I see
I simply have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma sent me on Twitter to give up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of how he wants it, and you get access.
I am speaking to her about it.
She admitted that she might have put it better, but she still thinks it is wrong what I do.
Richard had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He does not tell me what I have to write, and I would not do.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that public relations with the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim who is sitting next to me is sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I made.
I shall not go into all the details again.
I cannot say that Richard is innocent innocent
His actions following the assassination of Barry Van would make him guilty of being a real act.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe there is insufficient evidence to justify this.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective I will see him dying.
I cannot claim to be really objective
ES will give other reporters to whom you can contact them.
What you will get from me is what it means to see an unnecessary death from a man.
Man in charge of arriving from the County River to come.
The Vale was dry when it was the man of the river.
An attempt by a man of Perth, the police force, was unsuccessful when he was in the hands of himself and the water, just a few metres away from a man who tried to persuade him gently to return to the shore.
The police of Vale of Vale was called on Tuesday to be called a factory.
When they discovered the suspect, they tried to escape them toward the River River.
But it did not come too far.
When He stood in water and said I do not come out, come out and get me a few, said Senior Satisfaction.
He was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet, so he turned to a tactic of conduct - A good deal of negotiations was negotiated.
Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape, said Senior Sergeant.
It is an unforgettable example of what is happening to Ben.
In 2006, he dug his car in the ditch in order to avoid one of them and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the planning of a Ben.
Peter Moody claims that he tried to stop him and was in danger of putting an end to this.
Peter Moody claims that Ferrari has tried to install a new car in his case last year, and that he threatened to quit the race immediately.
He aimed at the and the races of Racing Victoria, and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the late wife of Lady because of one, the last one on Wednesday.
Moody said that he has always tried to do what is best for the man and that he was involved in difficult conditions when it came to the positive attitude of people who cannot explain it
He had been detained for eighteen months because of the fact and did not want it to be as good as possible.
I had nothing to say anything about it, and I have a long time to say, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything suddenly comes out, said Moody.
You know that it is true.
Sometimes one responds and one has to live with the consequences, and I have to live what I said.
I'll go home this evening and I sleep well.
I want to have a lot of people, and I want my owners to think I do my best for them.
If they start to think, I don't, then I should not be more trainer.
I then have to consider what I do with my license.
Before that, Moody had the bomb in an interview with him that he had tried to bring his stall to his stall.
Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Mr Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and he offered him an employment in mine to supply information about what I do within my life, Moody said on earth.
They seem to believe that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should certainly be able to take part in it because they have failed to attempt to grasp it.
Robert, Chairman of the United Nations, Chairman of the United States, David, President-in-Office of the Council and Bernard, current CEO of the market, was aware of this at the time and is still today.
Should this lead me to think that it is going to be personal?
Does it behave in a cowardly way and perhaps makes people responsible for what is going on in industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Do I have so much to do with the industry?
Maybe people think outside that I am.
Perhaps they have to accept my license and be in breach of me, and I have no doubt that what I say can now be considered by them.
But I have now reached the point where I do not care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I shall put pressure on them and urge them to take a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The people of the family have built themselves up with the long term they have been building up in the case of co-operations, and late delivery has led him to say that he could have his licence on the table over the table.
Moody, best known by his preparation of the model of nuclear black, called the ridiculous, after a packet of mud or sound was applied to the use of the rules against the rules.
It is against the rules of the individual.
I have to take full responsibility for this, he said.
One of my employees who worked with me has put sludge on the leg of the leg.
I could have heard it yesterday evening.
ES would have been the whole day as it was.
But it was also so close to it.
Moody could be confronted with a case for treatment for treatment with the package, and an investigation of this matter has been opened.
ES is a joke.
People who set up these rules do not know about the horse.
Let us all see that we need rules, but here we go too far, Moody said.
A man who has been arrested after having been arrested
On the weekend, the police arrested a man for a cyclist with a cyclist, and followed him in prison.
The cyclist was taken with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after he was hit by a car on the road.

Does Craig propose against rivals for claims to be returned to rivals
Craig has a criticism of his player's ability to refer to two Premier League favourites of the race as part of two Premier League favourites.
Sydney Best Director Trent Robinson said that the referee allowed the cost of a successful team with his team during the high level in Sydney at the end of the day.
When I was told he was one of them, I thought I would have thought I would have thought I would have thought I would have thought it would be better to make it possible.
He defended the crew of his team and said that she was only concentrated on her contact with her when she was with her.
He added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team vote with him with confidence, as it is true that they were worried about being beaten by the enemy.
I have not heard Trent Robinson refer to us to us 24: 2, said Thursday on Wednesday when it comes down to what Trent Robinson said, when it came to us 24: 2.
I can guarantee that, throughout the year, we have changed nothing to our system or to the techniques, but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with them a priority, and that is what we have done for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he apparently has a great team to train, so he is probably not accustomed to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
ES is already part of it, as this always appears at this time of year.
It has been attacked by an idea of exciting football, and his mentor reminds him that St George won the Premier League in 2010 with the goal of winning football for the Premier League in 2010.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He has played his game with us with our game with our, and how exciting her game was, said it.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized as a team, and Wayne said he would take care of himself.
But now he has a team who can play and which we consider to be exciting, especially among his young players with their speed.
This is the one you would like to play if you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not each team has two players like Anthony and Ben Hunt so they can play like them.
I trust stronger confidence because they are saying these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they did not think of us when it came to the big games.
It also pointed out that the game reached a higher result than the game did against it.
The game of the game was probably a good game, I have not yet seen it, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two other attempts in our game, but this is a playing game?
Or are there breaks or no points?
For me, it is the case.
If they mention us, it means that we will be meeting at one stage.
This weekend is free, since they have won the right to receive either North/Germany or the next person to meet at the next level in the middle of the park.
Pay $200 with $200,000 in cash
A man who is likely to be released a life sentence due to his/her own, in possession of 40 kilos of money, which were released after having been released, was released on a deposit of $200,000.

The judge of the Supreme Court of Justice, Peter was concerned about the problems with regard to property.
It has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, he explained to the court on Wednesday.
When he was with him, he left the police with his place of residence.
Mother and her mother offered a deposit of $200,000 as security in order to reach his release.
Working after reading the words of the two people, it is clear that the requirement of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden, judge said.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.
He was released on bail on bail under the conditions that he gave his Australian and Serbian passport, he told the police every day and he was in a position of 18: 00: 00.

Volume of Arms: Five square meters of cell
For months, this has been granted to a person who has been placed in a small cell for months and months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are placed in small cells.
This has been decided in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges who are affected, they can hope that if they are only confined to confined spaces in confined spaces, 1 of them will be 14 of them.
This was a success with his/with his/in Karlsruhe, Germany: He was placed in a position of about five square metres in a case between June and November 2009. The toilet was not separated in space.
After that, the man who is now at free after the name of his name has been moved to a larger cell.
Although the conditions under which they are detained are due to the conditions of detention of the country of Berlin, it has failed.
However, the latter withdrew the judgment of the Berlin Wall of Berlin in the case of re-examination.
You see that the human dignity of the man is being violated.
Deciding on the level of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, a few days of compensation were valid for the period in question, there was a saying that it would be possible.
Otherwise, it would be possible to fear a person responsible for the personality of personality.
The deal now needs to clarify the level of the individual.
The past has often strengthened the rights of people in the past.
So they only qualify for compensation in April, because they were locked naked in one cell.
According to a decision of 2011, there is also the possibility of a cell without a separate toilet.

If you want to know, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied, and 19 are to be removed by 2016.
Angela Merkel and the policy on refugees
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What does Germany have to do?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany following predictions of this year this year, and according to what is known as over 800 000 asylum seekers in Germany, Germany is even in a position to accept one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has demonstrated a determined determination in the face of the unusual challenge: I say I say again and again: We can do this and we can create it.
What is going to happen to Germany gives the following overview.
What is needed, according to different predictions between one or two estimates of what is considered to be the case, the average annual estimate of what is considered to be and the price of the last five years it is estimated.
This is almost twice as much as has been built so far.
The lack of housing is mainly due to the lack of housing: Every year it is possible to apply from time to time until the end of the year, and in order to promote them, they will also apply for refugees.
This is why we want to increase funding, from time to time when it comes to EUR 1 billion.
This is far too little from the point of view of the project: 80 000 jobs per year would have to be created each year, and this would require the federal government to invest billions of dollars per year.
Scientists and economists agree that there is also more need for investment in housing.
It is estimated that 55 percent of the population in Germany can be able to take part, according to estimates by the Institute for Foreign Affairs.
However, the refugees in Germany would not even be asked systematically for their qualifications in order to help them get started.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they can work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the individual, but also for the growth of immigrants, he says.
In Germany, there has been a political turnaround in Germany: From the refugee for refugees to the recognition of work.
Whereas in the past there was one for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, just like the one that restricts asylum seekers to one place of residence.
The majority of society has taken the view that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market more quickly.
One of the major obstacles to access to the labour market is the lack of qualifications.
So far, there is not yet a sufficient supply of general and commercial issues.
Research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts.
For this reason, the structure of networks is in keeping with the needs of the people who use them.
Berlin has stated that few parents give their children to their children, estimated at 10 to 15 percent: The family's family of family is very important when it comes to sharing family, and it tells us what the family who are involved in the family is when it comes to the youth and the family in Berlin.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the business, the administration distributes them in different languages.
If there is a strong increase in the demand for large numbers of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase it - by means of permitting more.
In the countries, students are prepared for instruction without having to attend school.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, also from people who have only qualifications in German.
There is no lack of them, and it tells us what is happening to them in Berlin.
The German estimates that about 20% of the refugees in Germany want to study.
As a matter of principle, there is no prohibition of any kind of state of the state or any kind of study - the only exception has been Berlin, but it has now abandoned its attitude.
It would be possible to facilitate access to the university for refugees.
After all, refugees with one or more people do not receive benefits after the end of their studies if they start a study.
In principle, the latter do not receive anything because they are not covered by the circle of people.
So far, refugees who have been living in Germany for four years have been forced to move from 1 January 2016 to 15 months.
This also needs to be closed down, but it is also demanding that Berlin's Secretary of State call for Berlin's Secretary of State.
Students should immediately become involved.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually give Islam the same rights as they have the churches and the existing one will evolve into a new one.
What is also important is the establishment of an Islamic system which professionally takes care of the people.
Rights also include duties.
For example, the representative of Islam must agree on clear contact and be willing to cooperate with the state in a number of areas.
This also involves the willingness to take action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Muslim's representative of the Muslim, said on Thursday, worries of religious conflicts could also become in Germany for Germany.
Those who wanted such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to be here, in Germany, in Germany, he said in broadcasting.
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
Integration will continue to be much more than today a whole society.
If this is to change, then the elimination of discrimination and racism will have to change.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has been a small and medium-sized company for a short decade.
But it learns very slowly, like the one that showed that in the police and authorities the racist motive is systematically taking place.
Equality of opportunity for all is what has been called for for a long time, and what international agreements like Germany are committing to international agreements like Germany, must become reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens are expected to make use of its opportunities.
In general, Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the refugees that have been expected so far.
When it comes to power and capacity as regards capacity and capacity, we manage to make it possible, as he said.
However, additional money should be invested in the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery, all of them with registration at registration, calls for them.
The services provided could be settled later with the federal states.
And, in the long term, it is highly questionable to have so many people with the limited number of people who have the right to use.
Otherwise, it is mainly the doctors who make it possible to create them.
So far, so far, Berlin has proved its worth, and migrants are more aware of their diseases than other patients.
Not only do they have to be taken over in clinics, but they also have to be taken into account.
But a lot of refugees would have been helped with more of them.
And with another look.
For example, there is much more disability, and young people are talking about them.
With the help of German doctors from their education, however, it is clear that Montgomery is clear.
It is not so difficult to recognize a number of people who are suffering from cancer, and when it comes to the question of refugees, the refugees might even see relief in sight.
They would have a system of education which would mean that a number of refugees were doctors.
If they are to be able to practice, however, they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and perhaps take examinations again.
At least half of the refugees in Germany are refugees who are estimated to be mentally ill: Most of them suffer from a situation in which they suffer from depression or from depression.
In particular, Dietrich declares that he is president of the project.
A recent study by the Technical University of Technology shows that one in five of Syria's fifths arrives in Germany.
Anyone who has become ill suffers from, among other things, so-called by means of one which is one of those who have been treated as one of them.
Further symptoms are male and female people, strong and emotional ones.
In order to prevent symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment was explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive a subsidy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can request a request for one, most of the time the processing takes several months.
In addition, in the case of mostly male or female doctors who are not trained for mental illness, it would be possible to decide whether a therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to too many things to say.
It is time to dream of a dream?
With the new production of passion, the Circus goes back to the traditions of the family.
It is the goal to attract every age group in the spell of life as a group of people.
Now the circus is inviting for the purpose of dreaming about it.
Love of Our passion is the circus.
I cannot imagine I cannot imagine without living without living my life.
Passion with passion - this is the motto that is the current one.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family.
The gift of enthusiasm is the family in blood.
It is important for us to bring people from their homes and take them to a completely different world for two hours in a completely different world, and they emphasize the same.
Director Reinhard calls his concept by means of a series of products that are suitable for use in the field of business.
50 towns on the nearly 3 000 kilometres of tour can experience this flair now.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from around the world.
Awarded an award by the international team in Monte Carlo, the Russian family draws a spell on the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their trade.
With the heroes of the band it wants to record the Cuban duo in a relaxed way.
Lightness and agility - they identify themselves with these words.
Your art of art is to be conquered by storm in the storm.
In addition to numerous others, the circus of the circus also fascinates with means of business and pleasure.
With the on a sphere of a ball?
There is no problem for He to He.
At the same time it is one that is as good as possible.
Wang Chinese from China is familiar with the oldest form of property like little and fascinates with her mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
The animals that belong to our family include mother, Brigitte Brigitte, who is part of our family.
Abuses in the attitude of individuals are all too often a topic of various kinds.
There is also a position in relation to this: It is not good for our animals to have anything to do with it, and it is not good for us to do so.
About 80 animals from five continents enjoy each other.
As they are lovingly called, it is possible to have every wish from the eyes.
We want to work with animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel like it, it doesn't want to go into it either.
So it is a good thing to do well for the animals.
In particular, the family is proud of its own product, a mixture of one of them and one of them.
The two animals have eight years and nothing has happened.
Then, then, suddenly, our little was our little, Brigitte tells Brigitte.
It is not yet ready to do this, but it is the unique balance of circus that is unique.
So, there is something to be done for every visitor.
One of them is safe, it tells us what it says: It tells us whether there is five or 1 200 spectators, we are always doing our best and we are happy with it.
From the 17th to the 20th of September, the Circus invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 pm.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is one of them, and prices are valid for the presentation at 17 o'clock.
It is also open daily from 10: 00 to 18: 00.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's leading leader, fell down from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained involved, but the video of the case quickly spread to the social media.
The opening of Parliament has also been confirmed by statements by Members of the opposition that they would have been anonymous and that they have been warned against attending the address of Mr Mugabe with regard to Mr Mugabe.
Last month, they interrupted it during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change for Democratic Change - MDC said that seven people were receiving them on their mobile phones, which would disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech before that.
Moving the message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title of death 'when he said he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the affected people that the immunity of Parliament ends, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The latter said that the party led by Morgan was concerned about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard Must Reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the company's restructuring and service.
Later in this year, HP will be split into two different companies.
The expected revenue leads to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
What makes this possible is one that makes it possible for the new generation to be able to operate, which means that it is said to be one of those who are talking about it, and one that is responsible for the separation of the unit after separation.
It will be smaller and more focused when it comes to HP when it comes to HP today, and we have a broad and comprehensive portfolio of businesses that support companies when moving to a new style of business, we said.
As an independent company we are better than ever to meet the changing needs of our clients around the world.
It is estimated that more than 50 billion dollars a year will be spent on the deployment of more than 50 billion dollars per year, focusing on the provision of integrated business for companies, making it possible for companies to make a statement of the company.
ES is one of the companies that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill and Dave Packard in order to establish the Palo Alto Garage, which is known as the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has gone through massive restructuring to manage the move from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The HP measure, which is the world's second largest business, one of the largest in the world, is the latest in this area, which is based on conviction that closely integrated companies deliver better performance.
FC says he says that he has to stand in front of the game against Zagreb behind the injured Jack himself.
He pointed out that it was only in September that it was only in plan, and that there is no reason why he cannot play it again before Christmas before it
This scenario already means that it will certainly miss the next four games for England at least, and in view of its history, its participation in the European championship is certainly uncertain in the next summer.
The great shame of this current problem is that last season after a separate race had ended last season, and that it would then return to its old momentum during the last season.
This type of injury does not threaten the career, said, said it.
ES is a bone that is not good.
This is not a bigger issue.
This was just an accident.
ES was not connected with his/or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as also recognised, there is the inherent danger of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
ES also develops a pattern.
The study of Premier Goods Ltd has recorded 23 different conditions since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 out of 157 157 people in the last five years.
The broader picture of Arsenal is that they were in six of them since 2007 that they were one of the two Premier League clubs that recorded most of them.
It accepts the potential of a product, but Arsenal believes that improvement will continue during the last season.
Sometimes when you come back from injury, you have a period of time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win it to win, she said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body will stabilize, I am confident that he will do it and that he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begins on Wednesday evening against Zagreb in front of playing against Chelsea on Saturday and the last Wednesday of next Wednesday, and there is a rotation within the team.
It was not Croatia that travelled to Croatia, and that means that it is likely to be able to start a race that is open to Croatia.
It is also possible to start with a few of them and Olivier instead of those who use them.
I have tried to keep the balance, and the players who need it to allow a small amount of money that said it said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites, by grouping F, the one in Zagreb is one of the biggest in Europe.
It is also used after 41 games after the campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake, with the stadium being measured at 3.2.
This year was the 10th in Zagreb.
It is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the teaching of the last season with the war against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the club to its first appearance with its management.
If this drive is immense, it said, said it.
ES has never worked on Arsenal before.
We were very close to that in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in the store to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not one of them.
One of them: Those who give us serious lessons about this
The lack of similar images in shows is obvious, especially with regard to how the need for men to open is now still more recent than ever before, as young men in young men demonstrate.
In 2013, it was the most important of men from 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more frequent among men than among women.
Trying to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living announced a campaign against a life by 2015 as the year of man, with the goal of calling into question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge.
A recent survey of more than 2,000 people found that if the sufficiently high percentage had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with healthy mood, his chances of recovery would become stronger.
For those who are not, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of problems.
But of course we have to have friends first so that friendship can work.
In the era of communication via social media, with its emphasis on style via substance, the answer to the answer is often more important than a contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong, successful and successful, even if in reality isolation is dominating.
This success is dominated by what psychologists call values; money, image, social status, everything at cost of value - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has a lot of impact on our mental health.
And, as one of them said recently, money can really not buy luck.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on its head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which by interacting as a friend.
The humor of Joey and frequent occasions at the time when it comes to time when it comes to life in cozy and the yearning of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case, even if they often prefer to fully explore their feelings.
Like one of the people who told me, I really know how to make a difference between my family for people who feel comfortable and are able to make a difference.
The men who contact us often feel unable to speak to friends.
The old one that I have in mind rightly so has an enormous effect, like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when discussing problems openly.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer them to them.
It clearly presents the small moments of business.
So much my objective over the phone may help people in favor of despair, while long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit Comedy Central at this weekend with a completely redesigned backdrop to the celebration of the day, then you will not take your friends to a drink in the Central.
Or even better, if you see alone in someone alone, give it a smile and say hello.
You never know what is the difference between your friendship.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to end - all 236 episodes - for # B
Di Maria meets to help business to help Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates his/her interest after his hits in Malmö.
Di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps them to Malmö.
This is where the action and the response to the game are.
Angel Di Maria and her kept course when Paris started his Champions League season with a very comfortable victory against Malmö on Tuesday.
Di Maria arrived less than four minutes away from the start of his Champions League as the one who brought the French champions on the way, but then they took a number of occasions before they finally increased their advantage, as they had reached in the 61 minute.
With Real Madrid and a group A needs Paris, Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are not only looking for the qualification for the latter, but are also an improvement on the way to each of the last three campaigns in each of the last three campaigns.
However, while they got the points, it was not a matter of course for Laurent to take advantage of a team of people who had to compete against him, because he was later playing against his/and against the club with which he began his career as early as 1999.
It is a good start to win 2: 0 to cause problems and relax your opponents, but even if there are certain things we still need during the season, Blanc said.
This augurs well.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we do not have one or two other goals.
After his injury, he returned to one of three changes in one of three changes that could hold a 2: 2 was on his own place against Bordeaux on the weekend, but was in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
Argentina's military was known as the man who can take it with us to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, when he came to Johan in Marco before he came to Johan to the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that they would achieve a great victory, they were disappointed.
Malmö, which hit Celtic in one in order to reach this stage, stepped into the field with nine on the field and was a heavy opponent with one of them with one and two low.
But in addition to a shot of Nikola, who was far from Kevin in the 34 minute, she offered little in the attack.
There was sometimes a difference between some of them and a few of them, especially in the case of not less than five attempts in the first half of the year, as they abandoned it after they had restarted it.
Nevertheless, he showed much more skill when he played his fellow players in the game, and it was a pass of a match that turned Di Maria into one of the 52 minutes on the post.
The second goal was finally shortly after the end of the project.
This ended all of the idea that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention of very short distance to stop David, the end result could hold down before a goal at the end of business became a goal.
The coach of Malmö, Age, gave later that there was a class playing a class above his team, and that he said: Running Our last resort game was in December last year.
We played only in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
They are not enough.
Leave in front of Paris!
ES was a great game of them!

The Next Generation and the Way You Want to Go
One of them wanted to come up with a dream, and he wanted to buy a Ford Mustang.
On the highway came the evil awakening.
With a company in the district you can come up to the dream and drive a V8 Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 horsepower.
This was also how this was done by a person from the district.
On the A71, on average, the dream was over and over.

Key: Change to 2008 prevented 2008 from becoming FC Bayern.
Since the summer of 2015, for the Sport Club in Qatar, since the summer of 2015.
A few years ago, a few years ago, the FC Bayern stood in front of the commitment of Spain's superstar, who played for the FC Barcelona at that time.
Eight times the world champion, three times a year, is two times old, two times it is one of two of them, it is two times a year, it is two times old, it is a year of world champion - the number of people who live in this world is stunning.
In summer, the FC Barcelona left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to Qatar as a sport club after Qatar.
However, in an interview with the official, he now reveals that he was already in front of the Euro 2008 before it came out of Barcelona.
She told me that she wanted to sell me.
Madrid at that time won it all, we had nothing, he told us.
And that is what FC Bayern has registered.
Question: There was an offer of Bavaria, There was an offer of Bavaria.
I think that was something I wanted to see.
Let us remember: In summer 2008, Jürgen took over the FC Bayern.
It was the reason that he did not switch back.
The change did not come about, however.
And the man responsible for this is now working for the German (German) release.
He explains why he has taken part in the contract under the Treaty and why I have played a great EM.
He told me that I was not going to imagine that he could not imagine the team without me.
With regard to this, he gave me something to do with me.
Anyone who knows how to run 2008 matches in 2009.
In addition to this, it was possible to reach the end of the year, as it was in the hands of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the grass, turning the Red from 4: 0, 1: 1 and celebrated at the end of the race.
Matt Plays Diversity in the Role
Matt also took part in a discussion about diversity during a discussion on diversity, and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night of Comprehensive Project It was the experienced actor Brown, when he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, with regard to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
When we talk about diversity, do it do it with the cast of the film rather than with the cast of the show that insured.
This was the first time I would have thought I would have thought it would be better to have it.
Both men and women joined forces to discuss the issues they were involved in.
I want to ask people to think about it - anyone who will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony, said Brown first.
The only black person, and she is one who is beaten by her white.
The producer of Dear White People committed himself to the time to use the film: Leo and her for the film as part of the film; it is true that they could give us something that we do not want, and that is what we do not want.
After the discussion was broadcast, social media were released by means of comments.
As he wrote his anger over the clip by writing something he wrote about the only black person in the room, so he can explain its diversity - that's SO is that it hurts.
He earned more than 5,000 of her and 4,000 since his release.
Comments come at a time when exact representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the teenager killed Michael Brown in 2014 by a white policeman, the Black Sea movement had an effect on the country nationwide, and urged legislators and authorities to put a stop to discriminatory practices against abuse.
In February, the singer Prince made the movement on the movement during the introduction of the annual albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
Release album still matter matter, albums have still their meaning, he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.

American Reformed Warrior First Champion
The first person who won the American Grand Slam on Monday evening was the first person who won the American Grand Slam on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $1 million with home.
The one who has just received its 7 season has never seen a person who was able to complete all stages of his or her career.
During the time, two men were able to reach the final, until the end of the race.
As part of the last task, climbing on a 75 foot long was in 30 seconds.
This was the first time he was the first person to finish the phase 4 of American, although this challenge was completed three seconds later, which made him the winner.
News after the hard victory was still under the shock of winning the F1 Grand Prix of $1 million.
I think it's amazing to think about it, I have never earned more than $10,000 or I have had life for life, Isaac E said!
As I cannot yet imagine how this is, the future is unknown.
The leading producer of Kent went to The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why, although he ended up as the first to finish the course, he did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
When there is more than one, it gets with the fastest time of time, said it.
How much the money is a wonderful prize, and life changes, it gets a great deal.
I do not think it has anything to do with it.
He has been so happy to have done what he has done.
He received masses of awards from fans.
This is a great pleasure and a good one.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
He said to me: If I should be defeated by someone, I am glad that it is Isaac.
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had had the roles.
America's target Warrior has been extended for a season of season, the shooting will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers On Minnesota Leave Over
The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously, they were one of the best teams in baseball, but today the Tigers are on the final league of the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as they played, but they played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota with the target field in Target Field.
This is a chance for the ascent within a class of the Houston for the second American League.
For Detroit, albeit for one evening, it was a return of the three letter that was so difficult to take over a large part of the second half of the season.
With all victories make fun, no matter how it comes, said Tiger Manager Brad.
Simon, who was first working as a Detroit for three years, was one of the most famous in the world.
Simon proposed 6 times on the 1 in 1, and made it possible for three people to use it.
It was his third successful start in his last nine games.
I want to finish this year a strong end of production, said Simon.
ES is hard to throw in any game of play, and so I want to concentrate in the game.
Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two, his first has been since the middle of August.
ES was the first of Martinez, he had four hits against the Seattle on 6 July.
If He has the good of good, he said it was good.
He looked well out of what was going to happen, he looked much better out of it, and he brought it directly into play.
With three of them working at the end of the seventh, they had their best chance of getting back into play.
Center of Byron ended the day with a double on the left.
One of the best Aaron had achieved reached him, and Simon brought his second, Brian, to his home before he was replaced by Hardy, Hardy.
Hardy Wall, the only man with whom he was confronted, in front of the Commissioner-designate, Miguel, who was a person who was in charge of it.
With a pair of people and the latter at the second, third party brought third parties to a double play.
ES war die in der Major League leading 27.
When Detroit reached the end of the ninth, the Wall reached a position against the league of the Tigers Bruce and reached the stage of production.
However, this is one of three of the best ways to achieve this.
Detroit based on the beginning of the game of an still less mobile Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three in the first two rounds against the one who had been removed from the game before the match, after he had been missing more than one month.
It was not the beginning I wished I wanted, I said Hughes, but I felt I felt I felt when I was going to make myself and I felt that I would create some rather good as it would be in the third party I would do.
After they received them in the first place, there was a single to Second to Ian.
A live walk for Ensign Martinez put into play Victor Martinez, who made a single up the middle during the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez completed his/her business with the latter in his family.
The third record nick was followed by a single on the right, another run was created, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third which ended the threat.
The Tigers put down in the second, reached a double of type James and a single by Colonel Anthony to the finish.
If this was a big blow, Paul said Paul.
He did not beat very well, but he caught the right spot.
Hughes was in a single, no points reached in the third stage before he was replaced by the one that was used to deal with it.
At Hughes, there were three of them with six hits and one walk with four.
Note: I have left Tiger for a breach of the number of people.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who is the shoulder of his in 2007.
Since the middle of August since mid-August it is scheduled to be activated for the start of Wednesday.
When it comes from play, Daniel Morris, who has been removed from the game, is deleted to start the race.
It was purchased with four of them with the Tigers, which took place in exchange with David Price at 30, July.
He has been missing on his right since 20 August, because of a lack of good.
The Tigers and the Tigers will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday.
It is possible to take advantage of this, as it is possible to change the number of people who wish to take part.
Hundreds of refugees in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
The location of the hotel was excellent.
The people who are in it should then be placed in the city of Wiesbaden as the city of Wiesbaden.
They range from 450 to 750 persons.
Several of the capital of the state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be there temporarily.
They should then be transferred to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, people in Hessen have reached the point where people in charge of mass production have been given data.
Because of the large number of refugees, Frankfurt and Germany have also established themselves in a number of people.
Value: Deutsche Börse in an option which is an option in addition to an option
The head of Munich, Wolfgang, considers military measures with German participation as an opportunity for a possibility.
I believe I think decisive reflection on military action must not take place without Germany, he said.
He reproached the European countries with the idea of a situation in which there was an increase in the number of people who were in favour of it.
Four years ago, we were pleased to see that the military participation in Germany is good.
When the conflict ends in front of our door now, he said in his home.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees.
Austria controls the southern and eastern borders of Austria
After Germany, Austria also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
In Austria, Johanna Johanna, who took part in the Austrian TV station ORF, said that no one would be sent back to Hungary now.
Germany, too, has not sent back refugees to Austria.
No, that is what has been agreed, it declared.
As to the question of an agreement under which Germany could include a number of refugees from Austria per day, it has been said that there have already been talks between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.

The strategy paper of the project emphasises, among other things, the importance of mobile development and a rapid contribution to digital media.
In order to test new technology, we are currently developing a motorway on the motorway of 9 in Bavaria.
In order to ensure that the driver does not have to pay additional weight to the driver, the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework and adapt to new developments where necessary.
For example, Germany wants to make an international commitment to increase the maximum limit for vehicles allowed for vehicles from 10 to 130.
The Federal Government also wants to promote an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only includes people as drivers.

In any case, German drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a vehicle.
After a survey of the volume, only seven per cent would agree to control all the roads throughout the journey.

The EU wants to double its doubling in volume
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large quantities and give consumers a much higher dose of the product.

According to the statistics, the limit values for large fish at the end of the food chain should be increased from one to two kilograms of fish per kilogram of fish for reasons of economic policy, for example, or for economic reasons, for reasons of economic policy.
However, great numbers have already been so heavily burdened with mercury today that, on the basis of the remaining limit values, approximately 50% of catches should not be sold.
Once limit values have been doubled, it would only be possible for them to be able to achieve even higher levels.
In return for this relaxation, the EU wants to tighten limit values for other fish of currently 0.5 per kilogram according to the limits of other fishing.
This means that this means that this is something we call it, because smaller ones, like most of them, are so low that they are already complying with the plans that have been planned.
For this reason, the reduction in terms of production is a form of business which is intended to be reduced and which would help business alone.
Mercury is a human being for human beings, which is heavily influenced by the food chain in particular.
This is why the Federal Government warns that already low quantities can cause particularly low quantities, especially in the case of people who have been able to use them as part of the project.
On his homepage with regard to the current situation, however, it does not expect to expect a health hazard for the product.
Above all, mercury passes through the environment into the environment.

Last year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most widely reported health risks in the market.
It calls on consumers to protest against what the EU plans to do.
