Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The congressional Keith Ellison and John Lewis put forward a proposal to establish the organization of trade unions as civil law.
Like labor unions, the middle class die," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and Vice-Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud, together with the civil rights sikone John Lewis, to submit the Staff Authorisation Act.
This ground-breaking law provides workers with the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the basis of the organisation of trade unions and other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
The addition to the national labour law act in order to create an opportunity for discrimination based workers to the organization of a trade union, in order to sue for justice against a civil court - and to obtain damages or penalties - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not American standards.
Indeed, the best way of understanding what Ellison, Lewis and the further sponsors of its legislative proposal suggest is the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that the trade unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries throughout the country - Americans once again encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and adhere to work rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remembered that the country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy, Hedki Tojos, would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the revenue generated by workers and their trade unions in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "the rights of workers on unification and common negotiations and actions were guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his team pushed the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Communism replaced Adolf Hitler with strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the conditions of work and economic conditions are guaranteed to each individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements which restrict this right or aim to reduce it are null and void; these measures are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the Presidency on the International Human Rights Commission, on which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted, when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted, as was adopted by the United Nations in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors provided a guarantee that 'everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect their interests or to join them.'
For generations, Americans have been accepting the basic premise that human rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to set up a trade union - and that the trade union would then be allowed to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with businesses and government agencies - should be protected.
Now that these rights in America have been under attack, it is indeed very wise to remind the American ideal that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement has not restricted the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions, work has, in a miraculous way, created a market for industry and raised the entire nation at unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
History is a reminder, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers" representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and the promise of democracy.
Judges stop temporarily law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force them to close.
A US judge on Sunday suspended the implementation of a law in Louisiana, the lawyer saying that it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics.
This action, which was made by Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, was brought into law in June and is to come into force on 1 September, would force doctors to carry out abortions to buy a patient's right to a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to purchase a hospital.
The judge's decision, however, means that doctors can continue to do legally abortions while requesting such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work according to the law, while they seek to obtain these rights," wrote Federal judge John degravure in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing for the judge will be set to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the youngest in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would be able to obtain more time to obtain hospital authorisation rights.
"The decision today means that the women in Louisiana will escape a fake law that they want to take to their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for Reproductive rights, which had filed a complaint on behalf of three of the state's five hospitals in order to stop the law.
It was not immediately obvious whether the ruling consisted of the doctors from the two clinics, who did not join the lawsuit and also applied for the right to transfer.
Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have adopted similar laws, with the courts having recently declared such actions in Alabama and Mississippi, not constitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics to be closed in the state, have been stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association say that the granting of the right of doctors demands unnecessary restrictions.
Abe's opponents believe that the measures are designed to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing hospitals.
Only a doctor who carries out abortion in Louisiana has access to the centre for reproductive rights.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to stop abortions, this doctor, for fear of his safety, would no longer carry out the operation, told the group.
In its case against the ruling, representatives of the Louisiana state said that they would not penalise doctors for the execution of abortions, whereas their applications would be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best possible treatments lead to higher death rates in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have made a video for their mother, who died in ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, found in 2005 ovarian cancer, and found that only 25 percent were still alive after the diagnosis.
The research leader Susan Jordan of QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than those in urban areas.
Small STUDIE: New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian cancer.
Researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing prediseases, as well as social and economic status, also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already well advanced, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than those in urban areas.
Although the study failed to investigate why women died outside the city, more likely to die, Dr Jordan suspected a delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly to be found in major cities," she said.
In spite of the improvement of telemedical services, in order to counter the distance, it could help to improve the service of frozen doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to supply women to their homes, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, found a poor long-term life rate for women in the ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013 Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast, told him that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Fishing Centres are pleased to note the fact that they are falling into the hands of their owners.
The decline, along with the increase in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to the fact that garden centres will lose tens of thousands of pounds a year, when today's young consumers are reaching the "age group for garden products" after a study by the HTA, as the Financial Times reported.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that they spend on their own garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular procedure, pre-gardens for parking for use and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which the estimated £5 billion is spent every year in the sale.
In the London area of London, where the share of homeowners accounted for 43% over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot take plants.
Guy Barter, CEO of the RHS, said: "container gardening, for example, is very popular with tenants, because they can take their plants with one move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden trade due to rising house owners and economic prosperity from the late 1980's to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the ghost Tahirul Qaddafi, continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators threw into the television channel PTV.
Information Secretary Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protestors again from PTV-buildings.
The transmitter provided an office for about 40 minutes, but now sends it back again.
At the same time, around 3000 demonstrators attempted to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around one kilometer away they delivered with sticks and stones to join forces with security forces.
The police set teargas in.
The demonstrators called for Sharifs's resignation, but this rejects them.
The army of the country, meanwhile, calls for a political solution to the conflict, 'without wasting time and use without violence'.
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the armed forces told: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The military has an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent.
The opposition politician Imran Khan discards Premier Sharif cheated during the parliamentary election of May last year.
The protests were escalating at the weekend after Khan and Qaddafi called their followers to invade Sharifs's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat due to spy reports
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the United States' most skilled US diplomat to report a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Secretary of State Bülent said that the US Embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel, as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analysts from the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a main practice area for the US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all the major countries attacked each other.
One earlier report that Germany's most important security service had targeted Ankara delivered much more disturbing reactions from the Turkish Government.
Warning: Local guide threatens the consequences for commuters.
The nationwide warning strike of the driver on Monday evening could also affect the transport of persons in NRW.
The exhibition stand for 18 to 21 o'clock in Germany all the transport companies, including remote, regional and suburban rail transport.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

Said the district chairman of the trade union German locomotive leader (GDL), Sven SchMitte, in Düsseldorf.
We are counting on considerable failures.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn announced its intention to do everything possible to minimize the effects.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it would be hard to foresee the consequences in concrete terms.
Pol-Chief of Magaluf of Corruption Against Corruption
The prosecutor set out on the office of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Mallorca evidence of blackmail by the police and staff of the town of Calvià.
The head of the Calvià police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested after corruption charges of businesspeople and landlords in the notorious binge-drinking-hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, has been arrested in custody following corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the road in which most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutor put evidence to the office of the office of the prosecutor for the corruption of Mallorca on Friday proof of blackmail by police officers and staff of the town of Calvià.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are being consulted jointly with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that angry host owners said that the authorities" cronyism had serious implications for their business.
"It is no longer about money, it is about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Let's do our work out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines in this summer because of a virale YouTube-Videos, in which an 18year-old British tourist was shown by 24 men during a Sauftour Fellatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the illegal behaviour of alcoholed holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious non-alcoholic drink.
The Playhouse Club, in which the coat of men was held, was forced to close down for a year, while Playhouse and the pub staring organiser Carnage have to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British tourists, is also well known for a number of accidents involving alcohol, including the trend of "balconing," in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first flight of the year with wet and stormy weather conditions limits flights from Adelaide Airport.
The spring has brought a wintry surprise to the south, with strong winds and strong winds that affected the flight from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m., there would be more fat rain on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already gone down in the night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a number of short, storyteller Schauer, including a fork that began shortly before 20 o'clock and provided for almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week for an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again to a maximum of 15.8 ° C on Monday.
The bad weather has probably led to the delayed landing of a flight of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was struck by a gambler - a sudden change in wind speed or direction by a short distance - and had to be launched.
At the same time, the wind was about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to run on a second landing flight and ended at about 20.40.
The flight delay led to the delay of some other flights, including an embankment flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible displays.
Matthies says: The time has come: High time.
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switchgear, Bernd Matthies is treading with a very familiar electronic accessory.
While I write this, I look at the spiral cable that connects to the phone with the phone, and I think Boah, how retro is that?
But there is an idea behind it: If the cable is not, all the listeners will be able to fly around the house in a very short space of time, and that would be much more retro.
Anyway, yes to the ekeltronic (ekeltronic)?
No, typos: Electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today's electronic waste of tomorrow is, bought - out of date.
And who, for example, still have a shower in the living room today simply says that it is fundamentally opposed to television.
Why?
Because the introduction of the Ifa at the radio tower this week confirms our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The Laie, the former washing machine and CD player blindly dominated, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread out in front of it: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yes, does it go?
What is to be said to talk to people who apparently voluntarily spread this kind of Quark?
After all, after 20 years, we have been talking about the fact that we are going to be able to interlink our house.
So that the yoghurt can order itself, so that the fire alarm on the Maldives will tell us that it burns in the working room.
And would it not be wonderful if we left the office from the air conditioning to our early arrival?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will soon come true: We will lift our watch, say "Saugen!," - and at home the vacuum cleaner goes nowhere.
Misleading.
Everything goes on nothing less than a revolution: "The borders between white and brown goods are becoming blurred," the industry leader, you can connect the washing machine with a single headphones, you can connect the washing machine with one headphones, the steam loader sends the weather report and the data brille shows how long the pizza is still in the oven, but that's not useful, because we are in Stau.
We also know from our daily practice that if a newly modified device is really needed, the battery is free.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable will survive the next radio shows on the phone.
Israeli children are returning to their schools after the war in Gaza?
Thousands of Israeli children from the territories near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday night to return to the schools, after they spent the summer in airways, while missile and mortar fires went to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the camps were recovering from the fighting.
The school start gave the communities in the south Israel a feeling of joy and expectation, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod remote staff of the "Pashosh" -nursery, which was taken by a Rakete, before the arrival of the pupil Granatsplitter from the walls and sliding.
"We have been a bit of fear, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, Anwoher in Kibbutz Saad and his English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said that it feels "a bit funny" suddenly to go back to school.
"That was difficult times, and we did not go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz near the border with Gaza in order to offer its support.
Until a ceasefire broke out last week's war, thousands of residents of the border communities such as Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to escape from Gaza and escape the missile and mortar fires in safer areas.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer, are still hesitating to return.
The Ministry of Education was informed by the Ministry of Education, about a dozen or so families had not returned.
Their children have been temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza, which is heavily marked by the Palestinian attack.
He called upon the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that their knowledge will acquire and give you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to an indefinite ceasefire.
The ceasefire ensured an immediate end to the fighting, but major problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for the lifting of the Gaza Strip of Gaza to lift Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea ports.
Israel is calling for the disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of civilians, and at least 494 children, according to the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters, but there is no concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other combatants in Gaza slaughtered 4,591 missiles and mortars in the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military led more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protected spaces and the fighting continues, the education authorities delayed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school is open again soon so that we can learn more, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza city.
After the elections in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questioned NPD-prohibition proceedings.
In the wake of the vote losses of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-dog vize Thomas Strobl spoke out for an end to the current NPD-ban procedure prior to the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - Laut CDUnderdog Thomas Strobl should put an end to the ongoing prohibition against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse off than last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU farm in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung."
This is a welcome development in the right direction and development, which makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD was very close to the five percent threshold during the vote on Sunday.
The first attempt to ban the far-right party was a failure in 2003, because, at the time, constitutional protection also had an informant at the hands of the NPD-peak.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join in.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the newcomer Square, refugees are now housed in tents.
The headquarters of first reception for refugees in Harburg burst out of the seams.
Now, the Internal Authority has set three tents of the Red Cross in the other way.
The district leaders were first informed - they are little enthusiastic.
"This hatred continues to fuel citizens" reservations and does not give the district political leaders the opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, group chairman of the Greens in the Harvard district assembly.
Their party demands that the district administration of Harburg currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the first time are the onslaught of help seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in subsequent institutions.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
The housing prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value index for owner-owned homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, so the RP-data of Monday.
Because of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price rise was 10.9 percent, more than double the rise in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The Research Director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, told us that Sydney and Melbourne were driving forward a split market.
The numbers of RP data show that home prices rose by 16.1 percent in Sydney last year, at 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged around five and six per cent.
On the other end of the scale, Canberra was hit hard by the cuts in government spending, and where prices rose by 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lawless said that the next few months will see an increase in the sale of real estate, which would be a real test of the market.
"When one considers the continuing high rate of the auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the continuing low interest environment, it is likely that home prices will rise further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion on the new press, he contradicts statements by the Managing Director of Peer Medau and attests to this "like a Feldherr."
This is not stated in the communication, as the College's style does not exist.
For example, the Medau family was informed orally at the end of June, at the request of the university.
The statement that the plans were not known until the end of July is definitely wrong," he said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not 'preliminary decisions or even decisions', but they are 'preferences'.
The extension of the narrow road to the castle, too, as far as the castle is concerned, is less dramatic than those feared by the Medin.
Of a nine metre wide road was and is not the speech.
It is up to date at 5.50 meters, which is a metre wider than so far," explains Pstilll.
The purpose of the Medau operators is that their free and dedicated park parks will only be used by students of the university in the future.
Parrot is not going to be on at all, because that way, as with other public parking spaces, it is now easy to solve.
The Belinning of the Belinning
According to the head of the university, the children's howl Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and would lead to the parking deck on their doorstep, is not to be affected by the university president.
On the contrary, he has to consider that this is not only about the children's chest, but also about the people living near the entrance to the Friedrich-Strad-Straße and the 800 students of the nearby real school.
We are therefore talking about much more than that of the special interests of Mr Medau.
Whether the criticism of the parent's chest, with the development of the road, would "lose" of a few natural spots of Coburgs, "may the reader decide for itself."
At the beginning of October, Pigi l intends to inform the City Council of the development of the development of the university by 2020 and, in this context, to raise the importance of the new development.
During the last week, Medau informed the parents of the crèpe of the school's plans.
Therefore, the access for the new parking deck is not intended as far as the campus and the Friedrich-Brenn-Straße, but above the Medau mountain.
That way, the narrow road would have to be extended into two lanes, approximately one kilometre long.
According to the rates of the Medan, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels would rise to ten times.
Around 2000 vehicles are spoken on a daily basis.
The intention was not to comment on the project by the side of the city.
Glandorf joins the team of handball players back in time.
Holger Glandorf will no longer be playing for the DHB team.
The 31 year old by SG Flensburg-Handewitt gave rise to health problems in particular.
I did not like the decision, it was over several months.
It is for me time to listen to the signals from my body and to finish my career in the national team," the world champion told on his Facebook page.
It is therefore going to have a balance sheet of 167 countries and 576 gates for Germany in international retirement.
Due to the fact that he wants to go on hunting for the Champions League winner from Flensburg, the new Federal coach Dagur Sigurdsson will no longer be available.
With the Iserland, who announced his Kader's Kader responsible for the country games against Switzerland, Glandorf introduced a "long and good conversation.
I would like to share your ideas and ideas as well as many years of my fellow players and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be healthy for the next few years, which requires longer regeneration breaks, which do not allow the current double load.
By 2012, the left hand had to fear its career as a result of a Ferseninfection.
Because of the chronic stress problems, he had been treated by a team physician of the Deutsche Handballbundes (DHB) with a cortison injection, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further operations followed.
Then Glandorf announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national entrepreneurship are not going to pass on to any body.
I have some health sites which I cannot ignore.
After three outbreaks of infection, which took place in a short period of time in 2012, I have never managed to get my blood pressure under control.
Some other wear-related complaints come about this.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I could control my head, but I cannot deceive my body," explained Glandorf in the interview of the magazine "Handball Time."
Only in an absolute emergency would he be able to make a comeback.
"When all stripes tear, I am always talking," explained the two-fold family of the trade magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play handball.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble as far as my health is concerned.
As far as I am concerned, I should at least be able to do so at least.
Besides the World Cup title in 2007 and the winner of the Champions League in 2014 he won the EF-Pokal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he secured the UEFA Cup of the Cup winner in Flensburg.
Germany's economy shrank by 0.2% in the spring
The crisis around the globe slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the pre-quarter by 0.2 percent.
The Federal Statistical Office shared this with a provisional calculation.
Alone, the economy animated the economy in the spring, while the investment went back.
Foreign trade, too, has slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual record, the first half of the year is a GDP increase of 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste," which took place for the first time in Burgmannsstadt.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, hosted the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste."
Here you will find the biggest bike tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise close to the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked for their registration with Jos en Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered in various trade magazines.
We came from Den Helder and went through the night to take part in the tour.
We want to get to know the Münsterland again in this way," the cyclists excited themselves through the route through the parts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the club of the Schützenkreis Sta.
Katharina went on a small "journey of peace" by the city of the Wall, where the start was made.
The route, which was called for three different categories, headed towards Herrenholz over the Schöppinger mountain towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres at 1175 m altitude, 120 kilometres with 1475 m elevation and 145 km with 1775 m altitude, the cyclists showed their good condition.
They went on their way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organ, Jos, and the Mayor Heinz Lölfing showed great pleasure at the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for all concerned.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölbegan a positive result of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not so many participants who had hoped for the organizer, which was probably due to bad weather forecasts and the dawn of rain.
"In the year 2015, we will be able to meet again with hopefully nice weather on 30 August or during another weekend," the cyclist told us again to return to the Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new one.
Retaliation wake-up calls to honest memoirs
There is, in fact, more philosophical testimony as a biography of what Konstantin Wecker, Songmacher, pacifist, politicized activist, former prisoner, in "monk and warrior" on 287 pages has produced on paper.
It is not chronologically, but more thinking about the communication of your mind. The Munich born in Munich founded his memoirs on the 1st of June 1947, each chapter initiated a matching song of the lyrics.
And he is ruthless: From Onanie as high school, to shopkeepers and drug use he does not make any human weakness.
Also to show how he has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also takes abstract but all the more important terms: Love, soul, ego, the being in the now, spirituality - all that is trying to go to reason, on a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and his political commitment - and not only the music, the opera, the soul and rock musician, but also his prison stay.
The latter has brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker to the asketic monk, which is "by subtraction" as he says, "by leaving everything superfluous."
There are also short anecdotes on the earth: Between all the high-mental views, there are also short anecdotes on the earth: For example, over mosquitoes in one of GIs, or a crazy car, on which he called the frontline a tree.
Here, too, he is ruthless.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Babylonian immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearsed for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One did not look his face, heard only his voice: "hör with the Krach.
Let your sister be calm and calm.
Take the lead!
I want to look at cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went along with him in the pub and talking about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life was he was this serious guy in the corner that read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry launched a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at his father's times, he won an insight into how life would have been for him.
It is now somewhat lighter, but they are dark, rough, deep stylized labyrinthe with flame retardant and smoke and much cry.
My father simply moved to the bath and then one could hear him slowly how he started to sing, because he could wash up the foundry.
When I ran there, I realized that he had done the years for bringing food on the table and my respect for him was greater.
However, Henry grew up as a child without the love of his parents.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went badly against the end of her life, we began, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his own daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love that he missed as a child.
Would you like to stop me with the "I love you"?
Stop me to embrace me!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still French friends with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys's own mother was diabetics.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very much overweight, and symptoms of diabetes pointed out, my doctor told me that they had to be radical.
So I pulled this fitness, and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is tiring.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henrys's career change may be shown in his elegant, short-cut bar.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he is captured by the theatre.
It followed The comedy of the verses, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from Sitcoms and coman, who have completed his busy working life.
He began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black Imitator/comedian on TV for a quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
I needed to be big not only in the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985 learning how I could become an efficient Witze-narrator machine, while I was a star through the television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 in New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program, in which the people "black anmold" took, Henry launched his comedy there for more than five years.
It was very unpleasant for my family.
I just wish it never happened, but I do not regret that I have done it.
It was a strange and unpleasant position for me but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of the black man."
With the introduction of figures that played together the British black culture, Henry was working on an alternative comedykreis in the 1980's.
The first series of the lenny Henry Show was published in 1984 and in the 90s he was known as the head chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie CEO.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film rolls embossed his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What are you doing next, "What are you doing next, "What do you feel like you're doing just the time to do it or take a little on the spot?"
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About System?
The first episode was Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I never learned something about him in the school and held him mostly for a domain of the middle class, white in pantyhose and a coal head.
So I had great fear of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench "you should try it.
Do not be bad if you don't know what you're going to do.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare so far.
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos's last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I had the feeling that I could do this.
It was almost as if someone had given me the head correctly.
"This is about it, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, your text, researched a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that simply did not happen.
Soon he went into the comedy of the madness.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought "Oh, you've changed you.""
There was a technical flaw and Henry felt instinctively that he had to maintain the public.
"A little voice told me 'you have to bridge 10 minutes while repairing the computer'.
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea would go on as soon as the problem had been solved.
I went from the stage and something in me told me "Oh, thank God."
I am not in favour of it.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
The text for Fences to learn was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
That, too, was a good thing, so it is like a large sign of the gods telling me "This is your order."
He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.
So I stand by it.
I really love it.
I love being in a sample room.
Henry, however, still bears the head of a comedian - our conversation is riddled with humorous eruptions, while he constantly mimics people.
I decided not to make a stand-alone comedy because I think that this type of instant satisfaction from a room full of alien is somehow dangerous.
If you look for it all, you have to wait for a wall.
I sometimes go live in Apollo, if I want to do it, but overall, there is not as much as I did in the past.
I ask him if he will ever again be a stand-alone tour.
The pleasure I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle section and the end of a trip - I do not think I want to give up the same again.
So is this the new incarnation?
I think so.
I love an actor.
It is fun.
It is always a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi-Rebellen blocks roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shia Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Hudie has called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi's supporters would have occupied central roads in Sanaa on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi Party "Ansar Allah."
Parliament's access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports about a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "feminism Post," Huthi-leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi were called upon the action on Sunday evening.
Huthi, on the basis of a further escalation of the conflict, threatened that his demands should not be fulfilled.
The Shiite Hudies are fighting for more independence from Sunni Yemen, and demand the resignation of the government.
The People's tribe of the Huthi has been besieged the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks now.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps at the great access routes of Sanaa.
In the surrounding region, there are still bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to contain "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to register biometric credit to all state officials in order to extinguish "clerics" from the government's payrolls.
Employees, who do not register for the next two weeks, would not pay more, was a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people are still receiving payment payments after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised in 2013 to fight corruption in the public service.
During an examination at the beginning of this year, it was noted that at least $1 million (700,000 £) per month were lost to payments for "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be paid out on accounts after a person died or leaves public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reported to the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear in the next two weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their data are included on biometric registrations was reported in a government message.
All those who did not, without a credible excuse, would be removed from the pay list, continued the communication.
"By this way, it will be essential to rationalize the public service by fixing the actual number of civil servants, and also cleaning up the pay list on both levels of the level, the "ghost workers" will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Department of decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach is being held in court on 11 November for the first time.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, the son of the Aldi-Grünler Theo Albrecht, demand compensation from Achenbach and two of its companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil process at the Düsseldorf District Court.
This shared a lawyer on Monday.
In the scriptures, it is said, Achenbach, in the purchase of works of art and vintage cars, deceived and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase price.
As a result, the agreed commission would be higher.
Achenbach bought for 121 million euros items of value for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He died in school, 23 years as a teacher.
From that time, Manfred Richter knew many Changeling Petershausener and Kollbacher from their times as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always inspired by his quest to see people in the student.
The snowmobile is the most famous mountain of the Krkonoše Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Judge was born in Trautenau/North Bohemia in 1930, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became the head school for the teacher's profession at the age of 14.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave the House.
After a few months in one camp he went to Bavaria - in the freight truck.
So he shook judges into the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
The teacher formation took place in Bamberg, Germany.
At the same time, Manfred Richter had to run six times a week ten kilometres to the next station, by rail to Bamberg, three kilometres across the city and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping area in a Rot-Kreuz-Home in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 members in one bed room.
In 1951 he made the first and in 1954, after three years of apprenticeship, the second official name.
At the beginning of the 20th century, he moved to Upper Bavaria and joined the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "milling machine room" was its first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958, he referred to a three-bedroom apartment in addition to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach, Germany, three classes and in Petershausen five.
At the end of the school year 1968/69, these were combined in Petershausen in the present-day town hall.
As the School Association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to escape the downgrading in the now smaller school, the then Rector Georg Sigl went to Karlovy Vary - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers, from September 1982, were able to purchase today's construction, which was extended to Judge retiring in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who built a workshop room and built cellar rooms on the community costs, even though that was not eligible under the guidelines for secondary school buildings.
"The mayor, Götz was very indebted," reminded judges.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgotten the speech of a government representative who responded to a unit of a school council on justice and justice: "We must never forget the love of love": "We must never forget the love of love," Manfred Richter put in, what he had heard about as a young teacher.
"You have to give two things to the children: Roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn: "That is not always the case," he said, "He is not always there," he said: "He who thinks his disciples, or the same of their own six children, is not very clear.
In any case, Judge actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students become tested, they did not get a form of punishment and were not arrested for the night.
At the expense of the congregation, Judge had two pairs of boxing gloves and left the two opposing parties to each other, even if there was a need to do so.
For the benefit of the school, the judge as a rector had a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the non-partisan judge to stand in 1996, at least as the latest in the CSF list for the municipal council.
But judges were elected to place six and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bike drivers set up in the Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and Scots stopovers
When Radler turns on her tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast, this is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of narrow impressions alone: The 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour accompanied by the accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later on a party under the free sky in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Radeln and celebrated on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met the participants on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday, it was taken seriously: The cyclists took the first stage, which took place 60 km across the city to Bad Salzhausen and continues to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of the mayor Hans-Peter Marconi, who were joined by the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the manager of the Bad Salzhausen company, welcomed Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of things have been prepared: The Landgirls from Ranststadt and Nieder-Mockstadt have baked around 85 sheets of apple, fools, trunks and cheeses, which are a wonderful treat for the skilled cyclists.
"This cake can be used only by rural women," praised one of the participants from Aulendiebach while he did another job.
Cold refreshments were available at the drinks level of the Turnverein Plage -Nidda.
The "duo Bravo" undercut the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and attended enthusiastic applause.
The location of the hotel was very good and the room was clean.
A man also enjoyed a head massage of his partner: "he has earned it, after all he has brought him back to us today."
In the meantime, the mayor and the manager had to work: They interviewed at the fountain before the drinking station by reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also, the promotion manager of Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-Radtour in 2004 as the tour manager, could only come up with snow, but he had plenty to do with the technique on the ground.
His pick-up print, in which he communicated through three telephones and radio with his staff and the 15-member motorcycling team of Hessen, communicated Facebook entries and submitted reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main-region," he told us, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from many cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants is a bit after the available accommodation capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collection.
The spa was given a good impression when it reopened after a period of one and a half hours: "Chüss!
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!
After the arrival in Schotten, the group was allowed to pause for a short period of time.
But in the evening, the cyclists were called in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS) the park has maintained a beautiful flat feel and of course you have prepared treats, such as a chilled cake with a well chilled out pen.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS-CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sach in his role as board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thuringia welcomed the visitors.
The Three were visibly pleased about the "many plant in Schotten."
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to breathe outdoors under the free sky has been painstakingly used in spite of the sporting activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests, people became increasingly popular with the good mood as well as the great schar of the cyclist.
The second day, the stations of Birstein, Guarditersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwals - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 km of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on the grounds of the "conspiracy against the government" to report local media agencies.
The police authorities did not give an immediate comment.
Among the arrests are 14 high level policemen, Schützriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in the corruption charges against officials, including four ministers of government last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly established an organised criminal association and had opened telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) described her action as part of the activities headed by the Islamist cleric of bourgeois slurry against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine are returning to school back.
Schools almost everywhere in the Ukraine opened on Monday (1st September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk sent his daughter to the school.
He informed journalists that not all schools had reopened, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in any school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian public front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukas, School Director of the School in Slawjansk, visited Jazenjuks's daughter, spoke to Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be restored here and that the children will have an education that will be useful for them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, while the children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC has perhaps found the great director it needs.
It meets with a proud rest from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And it has its own front experience.
His career began in the global management consulting company Bain and Co., which she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She spent seven years as Chief Executive of the Financial Times and resigned when the top post of parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
It was estimated that it was almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is sound, too.
It was recommended by David Cameron from Lord Browne, former Chairman of BP, who was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: She became a consultant in the Cabinet.
Her husband is an old Tory member of the Council.
Even in May, I described the role of the Chairman with a poisoned kelch.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two ways: Internally to the first guard of its own mania hierarchy in the BBC, but also externally as a voice of public concern and disquiet, when things go wrong.
This guarantees an almost untenable duopol requiring full comprehensive reform.
But what new president would risk it, stick to everything, and divide an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while itself perhaps brings about its job.
It is a difficult task.
And, as if that were not enough, many would like to see the BBC be reduced - power, money, and status.
As the competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the upcoming trial of license fees for the BBC is related to special dangers.
For the modest sum of $145,50 a year, the British public is buying the world's biggest media.
The BBC tells a good story: It says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and only costs 40 pence per day.
And, apparently, the BBC is rising to the level of popularity: 53% today, compared to 31 percent a decade ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and distinguished institution.
It needs a remarkable leader - I hope it has found it.
Perry from Texas says that vexed tweet was not authorized.
A Tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, contained a congruous point about the democratic district prosecutor, which is at the heart of a criminal charge against him because of the abuse of power.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of the Perl user user account.
A Tweet was sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the Tweet and I deleted it," he said in the later message.
Von Perry did not reply promptly to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perrys's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually operated the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavourable image of the County Prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned to death in April 2013.
Watson put a veto on the financial support of her office when she refused to resign, which led to a charge against Perry - which might possibly be 2016 presidential candidate - from a Grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweets reads: "I do not always drive drunk with the three times permitted alcohol content, but if I do it, I would call Governor Perry if he were to pick it up."
I am the most hated democracy in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not charged with the management of the study of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was won by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a republican judge.
He does not claim to be guilty and called the charge a political ploy.
His high-caliber team of lawyers requested that the judge should cancel the charge, arguing that the law, which is against the eldest governor in the history of the State of Texas, is unmasked.
He has halted $7.5 million in public funds to the State Integrity Unit of the State, which is based in Travis County, and in cases of government corruption in Texas, who refused to resign.
This veto enabled a public complaint from a left-wing Watchdog-group.
Perrys's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After having concluded five times during the election meetings in Iowa during his presidential election in 2012, Perry went on speculation that he would stop by sending a tweet of a photograph of himself in the vicinity of a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley declared housing market again for "normal"
One of the most prominent architects in London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England has returned to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were hotly sought after and the subject of huge price increases, which prompted Britain's widespread fear of a credit bubble to set limits on mortgage lending in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and Chairman of the Executive Board of Berkeley, said on Monday that "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the date of 2013," and added that this offer a "stable performance environment."
The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers went to the capital.
According to the map, the prices in the city alone rose by 18.5% last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales.
The average sales price at Berkeley's private, inexpensive, and student offerings increased by around one fifth in the past year and ended at the end of April by the 423.000 £.
But a larger pound has made less attractive investment in London for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric to a possible "Villtax" in the run-up to the general elections in May.
Last week's London estate broker, Foxber, warned that in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April, in which tougher lending rules were presented, would lead to lower market growth, both in real estate sales and prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a reduction in the mortgage loan in July, which also indicates that the housing market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for the rise in London's housing prices downward to 3% in 2015, on the basis of an already weakening skin price trend.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has fallen by a quarter every year, the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home home in the capital city for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amount of outstanding amounts for sales amounts to more than $2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added to this: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, the futures sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new home homes in the year up to the end of April - almost a third more than at peak 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased by 40 percent to €280 million per year, sales of sales by 18 percent to $1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year would probably meet the current market expectations.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to 450 million pounds.
For the first time in the London trade fair, green shares stood at 23.96 pounds.
Naked photographs by Jennifer Lawrence by hackers on the Internet published
Jennifer Lawrence, born in Los Angeles, California, was born in Los Angeles, California.
Naked pictures of the Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of other 100 starlets.
A representative of the star "The Tribute von panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were true and bailed the hacker for "flagrant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos taken originally from the Photo-Sharing page, 4chan, were allegedly procured by a hole in the online storage system icloud from Apple, the alleged "master's list" of the hacking victims included the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Wotten and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported Buzzfeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although WORK, Star of "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who have looked at the pictures taken by my husband and myself in the private area of our house - I hope you are so satisfied with you," wrote Wangeon Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victracs" denied, however, that the photos of her and tweetete "These so-called nude pictures of me are fake, people.
We are looking forward to hearing from you!
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a spokesman of the popstar Ariana Grande reported the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed novel about love and the letter "J."
They blew, so it could be best to describe them, they stunned slowly on like a carton to be found in the rain.
Occasionally a woman told him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distanced and perhaps somewhat scratchy.
Then he shook the hand.
He knew what he had to say.
He was stachelig like in Igel, yes, yes.
The last victim of this barrage was a just started affair, which had been more promising to alleviate the solitary boredom of his life than would have been, and perhaps would have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a treacherous beauty with uncut hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and dreamy as port.
She has come to the south with an older accompaniment to the Kün for her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a damp but paradise valley with the real name Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leck, in the bathrooms were still spiders, neck hatches had left their tracks on all windows and believed that they belonged to all of them and the garden was supervised by weeds, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a children's nest, both endangered and attractive, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" on the Longlist is the price of 2014 for the Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be published in the coming week.
Kevern participated with Ailw's hands on the broken deck chairs in the high grass, and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, both of which were instilled in the service desk, which caused the country with soothing music and soothing messages, as the sight of their crossed brown legs he reminded him of an ancient song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to have in front of closed roller blinds at home.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggression, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was so wrong - simply not played.
It has been made obsolete, as the word becomes obsolete.
The general taste, which would never have enabled me and regulations, and how the people of the books choose the vom-Teller zum-Millionär-memoirs, cookery books and love romance, chose to choose the ball in the music.
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and was riding large feet in a grob comic Serenade Ailfing.
Ailinn understood this not.
"That was a famous song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he explained to her and put two fingers on his lips.
His father always had done to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father played with his own father, he told us.
When you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was not very funny at the time, and it was not very funny at the time.
He knew that was all that was expected of him.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of that.
Jazz was not played even if it was not directly banned.
Improvisation was no more modern.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
People wanted to be quite sure at the beginning of a melody, where they would end.
Equally, the mind.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was music-driven mind.
Although he had been 10 years old, without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior Kevern knew about Jazz of the semi-secret collection of his father's CDs.
But at least he had not to explain to him that Fis was Waller's black.
At their age, she could probably not recall a period in which the audience was not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A conforming society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the group's principle - grateful to the fate of the fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origins were able to use temperament and body construction for entertainment and sport, so they sang and burned them.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent, like nature, were blessed with electronic talent, and were charged with the task of ensuring that no family had remained without work.
What was still left of the Polish community took care of the cannation, which was left by the Greeks.
Those from the Gulf and the Levante, their grandparents, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly than WHAT happened as WHAT WAR, WHAT WAR, WHAT WAR - for fear of being charged with WAR - for fear of being charged with fire, for fear, that the flames opened them as next, were given up with the fact that they opened their doors to watch the flames - and the Shisha-Pfeig- and the Shisha-Pipe restaurants were opened, kept in mind and became depressed by the lack of action.
Each one according to his or her abilities.
As she had just heard ballads, Ailinn found it hard to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just rehearsed could be made more expensive.
Music was an expression of love.
"Those are not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
He revived too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon sheets.
Ailinn still does not understand.
Why would you have loved your father?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated to put his finger at the lips in her presence.
She already thought, anyway, that he was somewhat curious.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
They shaved off their heads and locked their heads in the sky.
There was nothing else around the world than to see their uncoated rabbit black hair.
There was nothing he would want to see.
"If you tell me," I mean without conviction.
But that does not explain why you are talking about me.
It seemed to be honest.
Are my feet too big?
He also looked at it again.
Your feet so directly not.
Perhaps your ankles, a little bit of awning.
And you say you hate me, because my ankles are too thick?
You hate?
Of course I do not hate you.
That is just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but that was still too early.
"Your thick ankles are precisely the reason why you are getting me wrong," he tried it instead.
I am a bit perverted here.
That sounded wrong.
It was funny.
When he tried to be comical, he often encountered difficulties, because he did not have the feeling of his father who needed him to penalize the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he would like him, Kevern, that's his.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailbe Solomons was red and rose up from their deckchair, threw the console and plundered the wine they had drunk.
High quality wine, so drunkenness was not an excuse for him.
In her enthusiasm, she seemed to tremble, like the palm neck in the storm.
"And your hard head is precisely the reason why I feel lonely to you," she said.
Except that I am not.
She was sorry, both because of the unnecessary discomfort of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes when she opposed him.
Did she think he would beat them?
He did not tell him of the life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here.
The same huge and icy ocean left here like there on the shores of the river.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin, and drilled into the WAR when it was their ancestors, as their ancestors, as the smugglers of smugglers and landrobbers, moved from pub to pub, moved from pub to pub, always ready to rise the hand against a woman who refused or stowed to them.
Steel head?
They would have shown a big deal if they did not fix it!
It was the most widely used word for an erotic appeal between men and women, the most commonly used word for an erotic appeal between men and women, a counter-gift to the uncanny love ballads from the console - and then beat them.
It was, in turn, an unnecessary refinement, as the knee-jerk was already an act of violence.
Ailb Solomons gave him a sign through her body.
He rose from the lounger like an old man.
She also felt away, but the strength of his grief surprised them.
That was not the end of the world.
They knew little about it.
He looked at him as he would be - just like his companion - a man, complaining by something he called for himself.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some did raise her against them.
A man turned away from her, stripped his back, ashamed, beaten, defeated, without fighting spirit - why was that a sight that they appeared to be good to know, when they could not remember the only time they had seen before today?
When she was back alone, Ailtin Solomons looked on her feet.
Many years before the recent events, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnov, commissioned by Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for the public mood, attended a brief speech on continuing violence at low and medium levels in precisely those parts of the country, where its reduction, if not abolition, would be most likely to be expected, given the amount of money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"There has already been a lot done, and much needs to be done, "wrote it, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people, which has led to a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human friendliness has been, historically speaking, seen in the distant corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human friendliness has been seldom seen in the past, despite the high-spirited arch of Christ between the hedges.
But some characteristics are proving to be unmanageable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion he continues to awaken.
The population is crying for listening to sentimental ballads, listening to stories of outdated difficulties and claiming to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, yet not only does it not only keep the virtues of marriage and family life, but it does not only keep the old naves of rural communities as much as our urban structures in the hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and devious struggle for the home, at home, in the workplace, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said their mentor when he had read the whole report.
I suggest that you read less novels.
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you Atheist?
"I do not think I have to say that," replied ESME Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, ESME is entitled to its right to privacy and denial of the statement.
Feminists?
Silence.
"I do not ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "Because I would be against Atheism, Lesbentum, or feminism.
This is an unbiased job.
We serve a pre-prejudiced free society.
However, certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and laudable, can sometimes distort results as you have presented them.
You themselves have obvious prejudices against the Church, and these things you describe as "devilish" and "roh" could be interpreted as an expression of force and vitality by others as well as the expression of force and vitality.
If you go on on the way, WHAT happens, WHEN USE, as if, if it had happened, would have happened yesterday, is to take the country out of its essential vitality.
ESME Nussbaum looked at Rabinowitz.
Behind his head, an LED label in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had granted to the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Wake your neighbors, value your partner, listen to their partner, listen to their partner, listen to the ballads, visit Musicals, use their phone, you speak, you say, you say, listen to, vote, excuse me.
Talking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to do," says ESME Nussbaum with a quiet voice when she was sure that her predecessor had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing other than the fact that we have not been as effective as we are.
My concern is that, without warning, we might be able to find ourselves in the same way as we repeat the mistakes that took place in the first place.
This time, however, it is not the others where we leave our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formated with the hands of a pyramid.
In order to indicate an angel's patient.
"They go too far, "he said," if you describe acts as a "error" that our grandparents may or have not committed.
They go too far if you say that they have left their "anger" and their "distrust" to "others."
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are not talking about "us" and "other" in understanding the past, as the protection of the present.
There was no "us" and there was no "other."
It was a period of disorder, that is all we know.
"Of the fact, if we are honest with ourselves, "waking up ESME, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I do not accept no one.
Whether it has been done badly or well has happened.
That was then.
There is nothing more to be said - we are in agreement on this.
And just as no fault must be apportioned, it must not be blamed, if such eradication would be appropriate and if there would be a way to stamp it out.
But the past, if we do not learn from it, serves the past.
The past is something we are forgetting.
If I may say something about this, I should like to say something about this.
Luther Rabinowitz cut down his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day when she went to work as usual, she was taken over by a motorcycle driver, who described how passers-described it, in a sort of "brutal fury" on the walk.
There are some cases.
Lesoran's military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Officials from the military in Lesotho tended to have planned a coup d'état to overthrow the government, saying that they went against police officers accused of armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the land and told that the army of the country converted his home residence and occupied the Government Building in the capital, Maseru.
The Premier brought his family to the adjoining South Africa after having reported about the death threats.
Military spokesmen Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup d'état, but that the military would respond to the threat posed by "political fanatics" whose armament was preceded by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the Staff of the Defense Forces of Lesotho were able to do so, having received several secret service reports that within the police, some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics, who were on the verge of causing devastating damage, "he said to the Voice of America.
The South African government spokesperson, Clayson Monyela, said that military action made the impression of a collapse.
"Even though no one has claimed to have taken away the government through violence, all the reports agree that the activities of the Department of Defense of Lesotho have shown signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Speakers from the military of Lesotho agreed on Sunday that the soldiers were back into their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, the Vice remier Mothetjoya Metsing takes care of the governance during Thabanes's absence.
Thabane announced that he believes he has become the target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There has been major tension in Lesotho since the end of June, following parliamentary meetings, owing to the conflicts in its unity government.
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government, despite the fact that there were other allegations.
Production in the eurozone on a 13-month pitch
The increase in production in the euro zone slowed down in August at the lowest point of the last 13 months, such a closely observed study.
The final Markit shopping cart index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, at a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 is an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced collapse at a time of rising tension between the EU and Russia via the Ukraine.
The figures meet before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect a clear plan from the Bank to deal with the eurozone's reluctant recovery, as well as the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further details during the course of this week, whether it will consider quantitative easing for the euro area, according to those used by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the dampening effect of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty has become clearer for producers," said Rob Dobson, leading economists at Markit.
The Fabrik-PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, the second-largest economic nation of the Block, France, cut PMI to 46.9.
France, like the descent of Italy, remains of a solid expansion to stagnation.
References to the fact that growth incentives no longer apply in the key industrial mechanics of Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts that expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Business expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that you can say to the retail accounting index of the manufacturing sector in the eurozone from August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added that "producers in the euro area are obviously quite difficult at present, given that the current elevated geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainty in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably cause some jobs to be delayed, or even cancelled, particularly large contracts.
He said that "more likely," the ECB will eventually have to start a form of QE," although we suspect that this will be limited.
The spectacle of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children born therein are still suffering today.
Ten years ago more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Sudan.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the Greueltat in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the start of a new school year, they seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the Greueltat in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, despite the fact that the memory of these terrorist hell is going on forever.
Your biggest hope?
That the war that the Ukraine now finds itself - and in which children like them die - will now come to an end.
The girl who was photographed at the attempt to climb back into the broken school sports hall
It was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Besakov and famous when she only attempted to climb back into the crushed school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida, after her mother Larissa, was puzzled, now 40 years old.
Both were deemed dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me I should race my life, but I could not," said Aida at the time.
My legs were bleeding.
I stood up and climbed back to search for my mother.
A soldier brought them in safety.
After a number of operations, she was completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I am afraid I have to be working again.
Some grenades are still in my knees.
Your goal is to become a dentist to help the people, as they have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it has not broken me," she says.
"That is what happened to me and that can't be changed.
Once a year I always go into the sports hall to remind me of those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on the other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.
"I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think about a family later.
It says that the siege will always remain part of it, despite the memory of each year somewhat weak.
I am glad that many people in the world are still reminding us of our horror and we are grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
If I see online the photo of me see how I return to school, I think many people think for the first time, understand our disaster and help to ensure that this does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball, in the opinion that his mother is dead.
It was his first school day (Russians went to school with 7 years) and survived the triday siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.
As a seven year old he said: "Mama has told me that I should sit down if there were an explosion and keep her hand.
After an explosion he thought he would die.
She said to him: "Run."
He was afraid to be dead, he fled, and looked on the way of a young child, took it with her hand and fled by a ballast.
His father Vladimir, who joined his son outside the arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said: "I could not save them."
In reality, Tamara was screwed out and injured in hospital, in the assumption that her son had died.
After reunification, she said: "I was crying for joy.
I could not believe it.
He went into hiding and huffed me.
Damir was flown to London later (from the now published newspaper News of the World), to receive the title of a Barnardo's Champion by the then Premier Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, the title of a Barnardo's Champion.
"This horror is followed by you every day, but I wish I could stop by remembering, "he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will be blasser in my memory.
I still know that I threw away all my toy guns straight away.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes, which is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, whom I played in the court, and they did not manage to go there.
We never say that they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially to the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a above open car.
But now he is afraid of location, such as the Ukraine, where wars are causing the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered.
This horror affects you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me of it.
"I am so sorry about all those who suffer under the Greules," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I will be happy to help.
I will one day go to the police and I hope that they will take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were no children who could run and run around, and that silence lasted many months.
It reminds me vividly about her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London were crying when I told our story.
At that time, I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her Foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call in Cherie and I would simply say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with me and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped me.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Bormusch and called them all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant - Damir shot her water gun on her and ran away and played with him.
And that was just one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British readily shared our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
Now the war is going on in Ukraine, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are precisely the same children as ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or dealing with something else.
I simply know what people feel, the whole horror.
And I cannot stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's sad.
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
He is not looking for revenge for example, he is not overwhelmed by the previous Greuds.
I know he does not like to remind him, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and inflate the candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered - I remember, as he sometimes turned to the couch, the face of us, for hours.
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
I remember how he continued all his weapons and other military toys; Damir is now 17, bigger than me, good looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered to the explosion after the explosion, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with all the surrounding body parts.
I was absolutely sure that my small boy could not survive in this hell.
"I remember that I told him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he has gone away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The Young, whose terrible image after the siege to the symbol of Beslan was.
Comfort: The Immigrant Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right, an image of Georgij today
His blood-overblown face was marked by fear when he burned his life while Chechen terrorists beat his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a health care professional, left him for his first school day before they rushed to bring her older son Vladimir to the University.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij did manage to survive.
The closer the date approaches, the more difficult it is to think and talk about it.
There is no single day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think it was long ago, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Strong: The picture of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school on that day, saying that he wanted to help his teacher.
I knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also believe that, thanks to this picture, people throughout the world feel our pain.
Georgij today says: 'It is important that this never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People constantly investigate such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they investigate the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever hear what it has caused?
This world is going to be a terrible thing.
"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, as is the case?
Ten years has nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years for it to be a little bit forgotten.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares due to the siege, but then it was better.
I went to school later in 2004 and feared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That is why I always go into the sports hall when 1 September is closer.
I would like to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It is hard for me to go into the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I do not feel as victims, this story is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not paint me.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I will be a cardiologist.
My first election was an education in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health prevented me from doing so.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgij Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived, despite being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist?
One miracle: Georgij Faniyev was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was imprisoned in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, fixed on the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is really a miracle that he has not been killed.
"We feel it, as if it were yesterday, "says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, there is nothing I have left behind me.
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with terrible experiences - I have to say that this is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt myself a bit better, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time that I went into the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back and ask me not to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Flood: Georgij Faniyev today, with a photo of in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about it, and they never asked me about the school.
Physically speaking, I want it well.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can now run well.
But, because of my health, I could not study the FSB's Secret Service Academy in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, also the medical staff, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been behind me for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I knew I would not tell my children from my experience.
They should not know about them and they should not suffer them either.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse if the anniversary is approaching.
I will be commemorating the celebrations of the commemoration.
I know that Georgij is not going to go.
It must be much more violent for him because he was there and I did not.
I waited at home on him and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given me, and all of them are drawn here in Beslan.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is hard to accept this if something is so unfair.
He is a boy, he loves sport, but he cannot take part because of his knees.
He has been operating on a number of occasions, he can run, but it is not a sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but one can never be completely overcome and forgotten.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed at the siege, and this only strengthens my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and which I used expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart was crying for the cries.
I know from families in which new children were born, but also by widows who never again married.
It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped to me when I looked at him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
Why are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how could it be that we are now fighting?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only all of these rebels could attack and postpone it, as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was so excited by a dedicated command of safety.
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is brought into security by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not recall the atrocities
The world held the breath in 2004 when the Baby Aljona was worn in the poor of a Russian police of the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty they kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you like to make photos or videos of water, there is a selection of equipment.
The most expensive option is a watertight point And-Shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+Silver edition, which are both for about $300.
I added these pictures to a family member with several cameras, all available at a price of $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other subjects are tightly sealed.
Add your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders are equipped with scene and recording memodi, which optimizes exposure time for insulating underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras are approved for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and watertight models.
Take multiple images - because many are not going to be shut down.
Point-and-fly cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, Action-Cams are usually not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to view this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky one.
So make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a serial mode with which a set of images with slightly modified exposure settings are made, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, the more it will be removed from the surface.
So if possible you remain close to the surface when you make pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
This allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Take a close look at the objects.
This is a good Council, too, but it is all the more important because of the poor light.
It is particularly important if you work with an Action Cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to take care of your objects if they are to fill the entire screen boxes.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes, even in a gigantic organization like NHS.
As an advisory, he devoted his career to the job of sparing the sick both the agony of the disease, as well as the quals of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife reminds me, was a MI6 who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors care for diagnoses and diseases, while the treated ones are mostly preoccupied with something else: Pain.
One day in 2007 he was the one who began his illness.
"I did not feel myself," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulties to catch me out.
While he struggled with the grippe-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatient with his wife, Juliet.
"I want everything better immediately than later," he announced.
As Juliet for one week on a business trip, Lawson felt uncomfortable and not worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he was going to ski in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray inspection was present.
He suffered from mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest of the skin, that is, the skin affecting the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While, for example, some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer has been smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre building, which once was considered to be lethal.
For most of us Mesotheliom is a disease that can easily ignore.
After all, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in Britain since the 1960" s, when the industry voluntarily committed to use it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the substance - plumbing, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers - for example.
Today, as an industrial hazardous material, it seems unlikely to be even more serious today.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is the culmination of a Mesoltheliome epidemic today.
There are more deaths caused by mesotheliom than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, twice as many people die as road accidents.
Annual figures for the Mesothelize since 1980 and future death in the United Kingdom.
The reason why we are now witnessing the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for many years now (in 1999 all types of asbestos are banned), is that a mesotheliom is developing after decades.
And the scourge of the mesotheliom is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we are working, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know any class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a safe space.
The parliament buildings are aspired.
Even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy have already been identified as the starting point of this deadly carcinogens.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber either.
He found it hard to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks as if in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I spent six years of my training, a lot of asbestos was present," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and Pförtner - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my fellow pensioners will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he could answer this question at the very least.
"The four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital and have been affected by Mesotheliom in the last five years" wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I'm the last to live."
How many of us will still be ill?
At Andrew Lawson Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long period of survival.
Fifty per cent of all trade patients die in the course of 8 months after the diagnosis.
The disease always ends in death.
We can therefore just repeat Mrs Jackson's question: "How many of us will still be ill?"
The leading expert in the United Kingdom to Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that, between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to come to a halt, a total of 90.000 of the disease will be victims.
Most of them still have no idea that they will die.

A quick look at the files of the courts, which often affect the victims of compensation, shows how far the Scourge of the Mesothelioms is already spreading.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, claimed to have asbestos for asbestos in Janice.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations, one of which was the flagship store at Oxford Street.
Ms. Allen was 18 years ago when she began her work at M & S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing, "she says," I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I did not really know anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought that this would affect me.
There are few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestos form," a description of the fibre structure which makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is now the most common asbestos in buildings.
It has been used for roof boards, floor tiles, pipe insulation, wire insulation, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still viewed by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with the possible death sequence.
Dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there are clear, but indirect indications, that this was one of the main reasons for the unique high mesothelize."
Marks & Spencer's staff were exposed to the flagship store at Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not have seen the typical mesotheliac, but the work of Julian Peto indicates that its history is not unusual.
He has presented a study of the person concerned, stating that "an essential part of the mesotheliome is caused by work, or at the home, through work, or in the House, by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks as if no one can be expected to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which looked into the palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could not have been exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service stops and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos by Parliament's Committee rooms, with asbestos being contaminated by its lethal fibres by somewhat as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the West Minster Palace should have a 'clean health certificate', it is now undisputed that we need to get rid of EUR 1 billion of work over several years in order to renovate Parliament, to renovate Parliament, to modernise electrical installations and to remove asbestos, and that, after the general elections in 2015, the Members will be more inclined to meet in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre than on the Green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that 'the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the relevant provisions.'
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost.
Everything you can do now is wait.
A person who has never been able to determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
As Andrew Lawson suspects the 50-year-old Abbott that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where I decided to vote positively," he says," but I cannot prove it in my case.
It is so hard to remember all places on which you have worked and the data.
What he remembers is the day of the beginning of December 2009, where he got some kind of fever.
He was 45, and led an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I had shiny frost.
It happened suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I could not make the trip to the home any more.
As a doctor, Abbott told us that the pain caused by the breast skin, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He went for a month not to work.
At the beginning of the 1970s, he was able to take the film out of his chest and to test Pleurakathether, to find out the fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
His complaints, however, remained without any diagnosis.
His health was slow, and he returned to work.
The symptoms, however, returned from time to time, often after sporadic action and violent breathing.
In 2011, a patient arrived with similar symptoms in its practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom.
However, this is not the case for the Abbott Association.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's state deteriorated again and his family doctor delivered his CTs and X-rays into a group of experts.
In December 2011, in exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera fitted with a camera was introduced into the cave between the reef and the chest.
I am an optimist.
I usually simply go on," he says.
To be honest, I did not really worry about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was concerned.
The result of biopsy was in the week between Christmas and the New Year: "You told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly Abbott met with Macmillan-nurses, from which he recommended to take a lawyer.
Only now is it the definition of the scale of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings, in which pipes were often isolated from asbestos," he says.
The people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now becoming ill.
This is how Mesotheliom hits younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos in hospitals were under the earth, so patients would probably not be exposed to the substance.
However, many people who moved in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or underground cantons (as Graham Abbott often did) came with the greatest likelihood of contact with the toxic substances.
It is evident that, over several decades after the war, hospitals are potentially life-saving, but life-threatening for physicians.
It is still being removed today.
Students showed their chimneys on asbestos mats.
And it does not just apply to hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, stores, libraries and town halls due to its fabulous isolation and flame retardant properties.
Schools.
Indeed, many people probably had the first attempt by the first order in the classroom.
In the country, in thousands of chemical workers, students have turned their chips on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now often referred to by websites.
And in the meantime, such innocent items in our houses such as floor plates or scaling roofs contain asbestos.
"It is an industrialist that contains large parts of our real estate," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact of an affected woman was the demolition of a garrison in the 1970" s.
You will therefore be able to choose how to pull off your garden kittens.
The effects of the diagnosis and the knowledge that the disease is incurable is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue to make, but I realized that I could not focus on what I did.
I spent two weeks in practice.
Then I knew I had to go and I had to take care of myself.
Well, I will not see another Christmas festival.
The main difficulty was the change of perspective from a doctor's position to one patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was from all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to include everything," he says.
"I asked my physician" how much longer I still have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought "Na yes, I will not see another Christmas festival.
It was 's then'.
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made of the tiniest fibres.
When the asbestos is raised and the fibres are inhaled, they can be placed in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest of the breast and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled nadelidal asbestos fibres," says Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac doctor who changed to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital in which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has been exposed to asbestos is, ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some other people who would probably also have been exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
Once the asbestos cans reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed to the edge of the respiratory tract, where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work well with mesotheliom.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, hotly controversial.
Some suggest that it is worth trying.
Supporters deny that.
"You can't cut the chest coat," he says.
They do not come around with the knife around them.
Meanwhile, the cancer does not say very well, "the effect shows "effect, but not heals.
"sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But, in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients are actually living longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after its own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After he contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, the four years after he was diagnosed with a one-man support and advisory office.
"Hello, the cancer core," he called happily for calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years before and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which lasted four months and would probably extend his life only by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Sharon managed to "make things happen in a rather more positive light."
After the consultation of several physicians, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, Herz-Thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage in that I had to be expelled, I just called for an appointment," says Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is essential for mesotheliom-sufferers to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments eventually fail, many people are affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960" s was that it realized that a very small amount of exposure would also pose a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually found their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full compensation," because Lawson could not prove absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to an eye contact with Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, a Speaker of Guy's however confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the cellar area in the 1990" s."
This was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesotheliom-sufferers who are seeking compensation, an enormous problem, namely the fatal contact between a company or a job - typically decades after the incidents.
Many of its former employers have been sold or closed down.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
As a reaction, there have been clear new legislation this year, which makes it easier for Mesothelim's stakeholders to claim compensation even if their former employers no longer find them.
The law has established a fund of $350 million recommended by the insurance industry for all, which was diagnosed after July 2012, but could not sell it.
In these cases, the complainants get 80 percent of what a court could have received in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 pounds.
About 300 successful applications per year are expected.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many mesotheliom-workers, that $350 million has been a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurance insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum represents a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay, when the time had not gone away, and the workers could find them in a normal way.
Also Mike Peacing, senior Labour and pension ministers, admitted that the law was "not perfect."
But both Peaning and Morgan admitted that rapid action is needed in the face of seven victims of death on a daily basis.
"People are suffering so much and today need help," said Greater ing during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom-Act in December last year.
At that point, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which, unlike Tom Treasure, expected a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-course therapy, with Lang-Lazdunski a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This is, of course, the most important thing," says Abbott.
That is always the case for patients.
There is something you can keep going on.
If you give up, you will get worse off.
Graham Abbott suspended the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he left the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Subsequent scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I was just fifty.
This is not life-threatening.
That is vital.
Again, Abbott replaced six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumor is visible.
But the process is physically and emotionally demanding.
You have to think about practical things - about the money, if I am no longer, for example, or my wife show how the boom time works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
They need to look forward.
As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents it is hard, "he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I would have a disease with which I would not be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and unpretentious.
They told it to their friends and we soon received a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reticent.
She did not say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients need to pass through.
But for Mesothelioma, such talks are not brought about by hope, not from a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (like the end of Stephen Jay Gould) gives a strong sense of security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong the right to government elections, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament, despite the increase in calls for democratic reforms, decided against the nomination of the electorate for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate.
That is what the long-announced protests are in Hong Kong's business district, while activists have led the planning and mobilisation within a few hours of the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress's decision, in principle, allowed the Communist leaders to expel all those loyal candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said Legal expert Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong have been lying.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-Secretary of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for Hong Kong's government would be "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain returned to Hong Kong's control of Hong Kong, Beijing promised to leave the residents from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives citizens of Hong Kong a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the expiry of a nomination committee firmly established by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for land and love to Hong Kong" are to be admitted.
The decision follows a summer at which some of Hong Kong's largest and most popular protests have been taking place in Hong Kong for many years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the movement of Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to detain the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters had met in Hong Kong in a few hours after the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had achieved a new level of civil disobedience and planned protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not specify details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers informed the organizers that the movement "the occupation of the district was only considered to be the last resort, an action that should take place only then, when all the chances of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central county will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for a few days now, and on Sunday, the security measures, including police forces and barricades, stepped up against the government.
The feeling of many people in Hong Kong intensifies the unrest that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Moreover, there is growing fear that the values of Hong Kong, like democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under the mounting pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy-Central-movement demonstrations, as they threaten the business operation - the Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests that they talk could cause major economic damage, depending on how many of them are involved and how long they last," said Legal expert Regine Ip, who has been critical of the movement for a long time.
We do not want to fuel any fears that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also reported recently about democratic activists in Hong Kong than by Western powers controlled subversive agents.
During this summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral rights, attended by 750,000 people - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the greatest democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school leavers in the US is now transferred to the universities, where freshmen are offered with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK's first luxury travel service for today's students.
In order to be able to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options, such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also admitted that the service provided a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to deduct their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car by the country.
Together with our new VIF options we look forward to ensuring that students reach the University with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One company spokesperson said that no new bookings were made yet, because the service was only introduced, but added that "students to book the service in the coming weeks."
The company also announced that, despite the tuition fees of €9,000, a market for this offer is expected.
Students today differ in their expectations and demands from the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can precisely.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as a whole.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems to be completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students, who begin their studies this month, face a crisis of living costs, as the available financial aid, in the form of loans and scholarships, does not keep up with the soaring bills for the simplest means of life, before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on such a thing as the arrival of the student home.
Feminists criticise race and police behaviour towards Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo..
The participants rose their hands in the air and sang, "hands high, not shooting," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown noticed the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez a change in the online debates white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex out of the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
While tensions in the Middle West grew and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned into 100% around the breed.
In comparison with the answers black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "thoughts on Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I do not think that in feminism you will find many people who talk about white and privileges in so high class," she said.
People felt compelled to say something about the events.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Coritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University, Ferguson revealed problems exposed to black American women, who are not considered to be "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook via me and my partner, and get 150 times from everywhere, "said Mitchell.
When I say something about how Farthing is under siege in her own country, silence is deafening.
"How could it be for women to be free to talk about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, the race, sex, and sexuality in the US history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues; they live in a combined reality.
While white women now link race and gender into the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mason University, says that its predecessors did the opposite.
"From 1865 to 1890, at least 10,000 black men were killed and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman, "said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history in order to justify the lynch.
For Hattery came the split between white and black women at the point where white fighters for women's electoral law like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century, and found that the fight for the right to vote was successful only for one group: Women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for the voting rights for women, and the right to vote for black should come later, "said Hattery.
Remembering such things, one is well aware of why coloured women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade before white women organized against the lynx in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group grew almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - a mirror of the times that white feminists have played with the problems that black women have dealt with for generations.
"Is it not great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to education of a child as seriously as they do with the right of contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation, who built up their careers in the fight for reproduction rights and access to contraceptives, are trying to understand what this means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steiner went on Facebook for two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published an articulated article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, demanding more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent to the body - and opinion on race, which are radically different in public surveys - wrote the change," wrote Steiner.
While Steiner is in favour of a rather intersectional feminism, racial, as well as gender issues, are somewhat perplexed by some of their comments on the racial issue in America.
Christina Sommer, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole feminism," said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young coloured men, "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Stone's comments on Ferguson are in contrast to their earlier critique.
There are hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But, as the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem in the forefront of mainstreaming.
After the US border police seized almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, the subject of migration reform also comes back to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a reviewer of the subject as an essential women's issue, they simply need to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of labour visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories can be seen in the women's organisations," she said.
"Pig-house" in Ipswich stands for sale
The image of a house to be sold was removed by real estate agents, when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it easy in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, located on a private street in Ipswich and is available for 120,000.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - to which one of the pigs had belonged to a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner.
"The photo was, however, mistakenly published and has been removed from now," said a speaker of the company.
In the exposé of the House, Connells described the former collection as a "one-of-a-kind one-bedroom house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the site, it still appears on advertising material.
The house sales generated interest in the social media than some asked if the pig was included in the price.
The SWCITY Harvey hosts a new millionaire after Lottowin a new millionaire.
This month the Lottoplayer from Harvey is this month.
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth lasts, with a lucky winner, who receives from the lottery on Saturday nearly $1.1 million.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey for the second time in five years won the jackpot in the drawing of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
The winner, the winner, must report again.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit is for use in the small city in the southwest of Perth.
The city does not talk about anything else, and all are quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA-winners last month celebrated profits in the first division, an appropriate closing for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had reached the mega-profit of $7.5 million a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for over twenty years and said that the profit allows them the possibility of a world tour and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas asked for the gladiator arena
It is not only the gladiators who have been standing in the park for the first time in the Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Römerday.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who defy the rain and the early cold and enthused themselves from the historic spectacle.
There has been a colourful movement of presentations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martiean fighter group from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis," which used every rainfall to demonstrate their robust fighting in the field with soft sand.
Gladiator-owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presentation and sent his men to the ring for the heroic fight in various gladiatorial circuits.
First, the "Provocatoren" were on the row with a rectangular shield and short legs, as well as leg rail on the left legs and armrail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with a breast shield, a short chunk and an iron of gladiator helmet, bump and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiro arius," which joined the "Secutor" by throwing net, trizack and daggers, and recently joined the Burschen to the ground.
Because of the heavy metal the heavy metal, the shields and the foams floated through the Arena that could become a scare and bange could become the health of the gladiators.
But the impressive "Summa Rudis," the muscular referee, has always had an eye on the eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman daily and to make the culture of the Roman era possible," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the "Friends of Friends of the Roman Canal," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation time, the park for one day became an "Oppidum Romanum," a Roman city, as Mr Claus lamentably pointed out in his greeting word.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and many buildings that we admire today.
Some of these were to be seen during the Roman day, such as "aqueduct marble" of the eleven metre-high and 1400 m long roman canal bridge, which stood at the ventilation tower at the time.
The Frontinus society, once and now, the water and energy supply, and the business leader Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of the past."
This also confirms graduate surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "Engineering Team Two" from Rheinbach, the surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 and bricks from the original hypovest, the hot air conditioning, which was once the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs, two millennia ago, before they burned.
In 2011, the Regional Association of Rhineland-Palatinate had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Rheinbach Industrial Park.
We found the detours of an economic building with a intestine for drying grain and smelling.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural commodity, the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A number of these excavations took place in a glass stove, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa has probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the arrival of the Germanes at the one time in the Roman Rhineland - Morscheiser.
At the same time, the children also engaged in the Roman windmill game, similar to the current Mühlspiel game, or, like once, the Roman students wrote their names with metal masks on wax.
At the state of the Roman thermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to put their own mosaics themselves, tinkering at the booth of the glass museum Rheinbach glass mosaic and made a heavy wheat mill from stone at the stand of the Nature Centre Eifel Nettersheim in order to sill the flour for a bread or muli.
Along with the original Roman tour, which was restored by the two cold blossoms, visitors passed through the park and also arrived at the impressive state of the municipal high school, which presented the results of their "Römer projectonchen."
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the town of Wachtberg will also contribute to the 11th century BC, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus before 2000 years.
Together with the region and the history of the region and the Wachtberger Hiking Association, the partnership association and the "Oberbachem" group, you will find, among other things, thematic hikes, a lecture, cookery evenings as well as guided tours for school classes and remind you of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionic is told by his work on the feed guard, presenting plants as living memorials from the Roman period, and offering a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germanen" and associated Romans.
The Adendorf Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme within the framework of a project weeks.
With the Roman week the numerous, but often the most visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made available again.
At the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation of the Fund of the Bercumer Matronenheiligtum was to be remembered in 1879.
Ebola
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go on distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic made the economy of West Africa a heavy blow.
The harvest rotates in the fields, the mines are leaving and the markets orphaned - the virus has severely reduced the region.
Some international companies are already on the line, too.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," of the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit.
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, sold on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia clothing.
The market only comes to buy food or something to disinfect at Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, only here fell to the fever of more than 600 people.
Recently, health officials said that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
More than 1500 people died, and thousands of others died.
Foreign companies attract staff from
Throughout the resource-rich countries, firms are running out of business.
Foreign companies, such as the Arcelor Mittal steel group, are leaving their employees, and several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
Also the local merchants and peasants: Few merchants are still leaving their homes to obtain supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among others the cocoa and coffee beans on the fields that are important for export.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food will be short
"The people will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables, is better at home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and pressing: Food will be scarce.
In the markets, supplies of staple foods like rice are disappearing.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is in danger of being a source of image, with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will rule out the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon, the French think tank Iris.
What matters is how long and how long the virus is going to spread.
The impression is given to investors that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and thus to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the hard-pressed national budgets of states.
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the states concerned.
The credit rating agency Moody's fears that its budgets are heavily strained by high spending on the health system and in addition to the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the affected countries' health systems of EUR 60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are already being felt in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already afraid of contagion at home.
Reservations in hotels are also very much back.
Protect the 50th Anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
The preparations for the 50-year-old foundation from 12 to 14 September are under way at the Schützenverein Tannenwald.
Planned is on Friday, 12th September, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker."
On Saturday, at 6 p.m. the great Bon shoot.
Then there is the big tent of the evening with the "Stoapcounterfeizer Hochbuam."
Brass Band adds to the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festival service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the great feast at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon, there is also the price allocation of the Bundes- and Gauvent.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 Festdamen with their dirndln.
Festkapelle is the brass band Berngau.
The patron was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907 when, on 21 March, the association for "social entertainment" was founded.
The Nazi regime had led to the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964, 19 young men joined again, who, on 30 April, opened their way to the "new" protectorate "Tannenwald" of Berngau.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a guard master through a difficult initial period in which it was mainly concerned to find a club's local and to install the shooting range.
Already in the autumn of 1965 the Schützenverein started in the "Leininger" guesthouse with two teams in the lap competitions.
In the following years the sports protected, which have meanwhile been organized into seven teams, took place in all classes up to the 1st Gauloon League.
The club recorde purges each year and the magic limit of 380 rings has been achieved by Rudi Meier for the first time in 1980.
As the performance of the active protectors increased, the number of members has also improved.
After the association "Leininger" no longer meets the requirements of a modern protectorate, the former Board of Directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future residence in the cellar rooms of the new Landgasthof Härteis.
After a working performance of 2700 hours on 8 May 1988 priest Strasser for the new trenches was granted the ecclesiastical blessing.
One of the major highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaushoot, coupled with the award ceremony of the new trench in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a Böll Group was set up.
Josef Schmalzl became a Böllerreferent.
A big challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the direction of the Bayerische BöllerMeeting 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the club members modernised the rooms and the shooting range at the Berngauer Hof last year and brought them up to date.
11 Teams in Rast competitions
The sporting achievements of the Schützenverein can be seen as well.
In total, there are currently eleven teams participating in the lap competitions: Six air force teams, a fireball team, a sports gun, KK1, a youth and two AH-teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Keller, grew up in the League 1 in the round of 2013/14, the highest league in the Schützengau ANB.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml have risen from the Gauloon North to the Gaurise League.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as bockings, carnival and royal ball, club flight and Christmas party were a tradition.
The patron is also present at the festivals in the parish and the municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers from the accident when he returned to the race track.
Tony Stewarts's return to the race track ended roughly halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall again for the second time, after his right to toe in the round of 172 and ending his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car to the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that his 14-team team is disappointed, but now the race will be focusing on the upcoming weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had had better deployment and would have a better result for him, "said Johnston.
We drive to Richmond and hope that we will be able to do better there.
Stewart played back on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch in a wall and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I wrote very good hopes for a good result today," said Johnston and added to it: "It did not work."
Not long after the second accident was loaded Stewarts car into the lockbox and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart had three NASCAR Sprint Cup racing, after his car met and killed another rider in the Aschenbahn race in the north of New York.
He decided to return this week and to win either in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond, in order to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to work, while an investigation into the tragic incident, which led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr, was examined, which took place during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities informed on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident would last at least for two weeks.
No decision has been taken on whether Stewart must reckon with a charge.
The triple champion was received with great acclaim when he was presented before the race.
After a start to the 12th position, Stewart had already penetrated the first 10 and was temporarily placed on stage four.
After a restart in round 122, bushs arrived.
Cars with the no. 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, whereby both cars went against the Wall.
Stewart continued to grow, but fell to place in 21.
The Tribute to Young Young
Simply try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) look forward to supporters.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups can also be found at the TV Jahn in full-day teaching at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays some groups have been heavily decimated.
Now young people are looking for a sport that is healthy and has fun.
In the two jazz and modernism groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the Jazz- and Modern Dance-formation "Spirits," are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to 12 years, six in the group of the 12-15-year-olds," tells the 20 year olds.
With more actives it would make it much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreography," she says.
If you want to dance, Thursdays between 17 and 18 p.m. or on Fridays between 17 and 6.30 pm in the dance sport room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, are free of charge to the training hour.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," tells the trainer.
Then, different choreography is carried out.
Jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no defined form and is therefore open for many styles.
Elements from folklore from classical to sport and acrobatics are processed in the jazz dance.
Of course, the conviviality is not too short, too.
"We go for dinner, watch dance films and we stayed in the dancing room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a wonderful hobby and still do a lot for their own motor development.
If you don't like jazz, you can also take part in one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always take part in the lessons in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini-Ballett, videoclip dancing and hip-hop in the lessons.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you are interested in disco fox, long-run Walzer, Viennese Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can visit and participate.
The International Labour Organisation (Criminal Court) and the State of Criminal Court (Criminal Court) are protesting nationwide
Hundreds of prison officers from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest against the Justice Meeting in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their requests to restore their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on the list of receivables to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister, Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically about the new working time for one month and calling for a return to the previous 24 hours.
Despite the meeting between the union of prison officers and the members of the Justice Council, no agreement was reached, reported the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR).
The negotiations continue, the Director-General told for the execution of penalties, roses Zhelyazkov the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the trade union association of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian Army has abandoned the airport of Luhansk
The rebel militants continue on the rise in the Ostukraine.
The Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk.
The army also ruled that seven soldiers were killed during the last 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, had previously already had the personal consequences of his army's severe defeats in the fight against the separatists, and announced changes in the senior army leadership, without mentioning details.
Prorussia separatists shock aircraft from now on.
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussal separatists have once again fired a fighter aircraft and two helicopter helicopters.
More than 100 soldiers were injured or killed in battles in the area of Donetsk in the region, according to the insurgents on Monday Russian agencies.
Ships for the Coast Guard
The insurgents also claimed, for the first time in the Azov Sea, that two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard have been reduced.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of its ships were under attack on Sunday in the vicinity of the port of Mariupol.
In this case, seven border guards were injured, a speaker in Kiev told the sender 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several villages were brought under their control in the area of Donetsk.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukrainian capital Minsk today meets the Ukrainian capital, Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, there should also be a meeting of the separatists from the Ostuderine.
In the run-up, all players used their appearances to publicise their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned deployment in Eastern Europe due to the Ukrainian crisis.
NATO's Secretary of State, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said on Monday in Brussels, that NATO was in favour of the founding agreement of the 1997 NATO-Russia Council.
However, NATO's chief accused Russia of "a gross chasm" of the agreement.
"Today we need to face up to reality, that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," so Rasmussen.
From documents and opinions from the Russian side, they say "that they regard us as opponents."
Greater NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that it wants to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
One at the NATO summit in Wales on the adoption of the 'Readiness Action Plan' will ensure that 'we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as it is needed', Mr Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agreed on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have, according to official data, agreed on new talks on the settlement of their gas strikes.
The negotiations should be scheduled for next Saturday, the Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision by the European Union on whether to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has no longer received a fuel from Russia for weeks.
Lastly, Commissioner, Commissioner Oettinger, the EU Commissioner for Energy, has given way to Mr Oettinger.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe accounts for about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks Power Word: Toll will be "very clear"
Now, the Chancellor again is making a clear commitment to this.
However, it is not a licence for all the complex details.
Strong objections from the CDU to the toll of the car have surreputed the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke in favour of the introduction of a toll on passenger transport, after persistent opposition from its CDU.
"To make it quite clear: They are in the coalition agreement, and they will come," said the party leader on Monday after meeting the boards of the CDU in Berlin.
However, for the moment, Merkel has not been firm on a detailed model.
The black red government program called "certain parameters."
Federal Minister for Transport, Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), has put forward a proposal, and that is what we are now working on.'
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its 'no' to a toll on all roads.
Merkel also pointed out that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is participating constructively in the debate on a draft law.
Beyond the issue, he also talked about further ways to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, for example in the field of broadband expansion.
"Since there is nothing special about it," Schäuble left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house tested his own concept to reward motorway investors with tolls - after the election in 2017.
CSU's CEO Horst Seehofer warned that he would develop toll concepts against the relevant minister.
CDsubmarine Armin Laschet reconfirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never ceased to be on board," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU leader.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Mr Seehofer has just announced that he will talk about the subject once again.
Opposition to the plans comes from the Federal Ministry of the Interior of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
There are concerns about the fact that a toll is affecting small border traffic with neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded from ranks of the CDU coalition party because of the death penalty from ranks of the CDU.
The left view the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murk toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "new hospital newspaper" (Monday).
"The toll fails to the ministers." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads that are due to start in 2016.
However, local autoowners will not be subject to additional burdens on the basis of the Coalition Agreement.
Therefore, they should obtain full compensation for the toll on the vehicle tax.
The model cannot, however, penalise foreign drivers because of their nationality, according to EU law.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed?
A britin says she thought over many years as a result of a misdiagnosis that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all of their youth in the belief that they only lived for a few years after being diagnosed with another disease.
It was actually affected by the Charcot-Mars disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnosis is a common problem for people with CMT, because so little about this disease is known.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which may lead to motor disorders, such as muscle weakness, an unsafe spiral, and curved toes.
The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms are worse.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she had a disease with very poor chance of survival.
Rodgers thought they would sit in a wheelchair before they would be 18, and die before their 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who are now 51 years old said: 'as a child I knew I could not do the same as the others.
I fell constantly and everything took me longer.
I could never go with the other children rollshoe or skateboard and was often dressed in the school because of my way and to walk.
Rodgers said that, at the age of 13, after several operations to discharge their Achilles" s ages and stretch their feet, they saw their health records when their doctor had left and read that they had been suffering from IAs.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I did not tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society, "she said.
When I received my answer, I was shocked and shocked to panic.
I thought I would be 18 in a wheelchair and die, with 25, and in between slow all my abilities would lose.
I made it all with me and I planned my own funeral.
She told her, when she was 17, she realized that her skills were not so much lost as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got on and embraced me and said, "my love, I do not think you have that, otherwise you will be already in the wheelchair."
I think you have a lot less life-threatening.
According to some genetic tests, their CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt as if I was a winner, "she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-marketing month to highlight this disease.
Since the closure of the former troop boom as a fireman, D. Berni Diether has been working in the field of webel.
For nearly ten years, the former army of troops has ceased to be taking place in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, depleted uranium slides are still appearing at the heart of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve at the heart of the Swabian region.
The grenades are still so dangerous that they need to be sprayed on the spot.
A deafening bang on the explosives at the heart of the Biosphere Reserve.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was held in Münsingen, closed by the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since that time, the 6500 acre area is the core of the Swabian territory of Swabian Alb, open to 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists.
Taxation of businessmen in the space of Washington increases with economic recovery
Economic recovery means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax exemptions for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated, such as a newly published study last week, and the firms in the Washington region were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia spend $27,6 billion in government and local authorities in the 2013 financial year, an increase of 3.8 percent in the amount of $26.6 billion in 2012.
The government's government and corporate tax burden increased by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9% in the previous year, and the third growth year followed after several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes increased more than local taxes, 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the centre of State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of the revenue is derived from businesses.
Virginia accounts for 28 percent of the lowest tax revenue from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is justified in a recovery of companies" real estate values, say, researchers, which led to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year, after three consecutive years, with growth rates of less than 1%.
While much of these profits came from large countries, such as California, New York and Texas, the course seems to be taking place in Washington as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid together over $10 billion in public and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of a year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not so effective in Maryland to increase state and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes amount to barely more than one-fifth of the tax revenue of businesses.
Businesses in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, the following: A large part of real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C, is either owned by the government or by non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Thus, Bhutan is obliged to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to provide the same services that the other states offer.
The recent recovery in company tax revenues cannot only add to the recovery of the real estate market alone.
Company revenues also seem to recover, so the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes among state organisations of $2.3 billion in comparison to 2.1 billion in 2012.
$1 billion in corporate income was $1 billion, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is heading in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not grow evenly in all three places.
The higher rate in the district was 4.3 percent of the country's average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an undervalued tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6% in all three jurisdictions, has the lowest levels of income tax (in all three there are firm company tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland stands at 8.25 percent and in the district with relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that weak state and local business taxes were imposed in Virginia and there is a better tax climate than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not investigated.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.9% to 6% this year, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5% in the coming year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's income tax rate down to 3% by 2017.
Meanwhile, the small businesses seem to be doing better in the space of Washington, and so they are paying more state and local taxes, the latest study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid for personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transition structure, organized by most small businesses - in District, Maryland, and Virginia last year increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes overall.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to last this year, with an increase in general tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the space of Washington may be lagging behind if the federal government's spending cuts affect the job market in the region.
Partner City: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and Malz - also a popular combination in China.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a flight direct link between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's sister town of Guangzhou - that's the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the Vice-Secretary General of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a PLC delegation in his city.
Time and again, the ruling Communist Party's governing Communist Party returned to this cause of the twelfth million metropolis during the course of the discussion.
Guangzhou, which is also called Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
That is why people have the purchasing power of buying German beer.
The Hessical SPD-Chairman Thorsten Schäfer Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he was going to listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it does not need much: Good water, cereals and joie de vivre," he added to the party's top in Guangzhou at the lunch.
This joy of life adds up to Mr Li, flattering him to the host.
As a result, the official from Guangzhou with Schämbel collapsed, but with a red wine served at the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingemi goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao-beer is brewed according to the German seal of purity.
More Trade
A second request from the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said vice leader Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but dropped out for economic reasons in 2012.
"It would be profitable," the local councillor convinced.
"The trade between our two cities continues to grow."
Currently, passengers should take the detvia Changsha in the province of Hunan, cloned Li.
The administration of Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, hopes for the flight.
The Vice-Governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, raised this wish during his interview with the Social Democrats in the foreground.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer Gümbel - the Chinese vice minister, Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany.
Sustainable partnership
The humble vice leader of Guangzhou hopes that next year he will be able to visit a partner meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this role.
He came to office only this year when his predecessor had been expelled from the office because of corruption charges.
Also the local party leader Wan Qinglian had to go.
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is pushed by head of head Xi Jinping.
The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Prior to taking office in Guangzhou, he served as the leading force in Fujian, where the VW VW plant was established.
Frankfurt officially received more than a dozen municipal twists.
The link to the Guangzhou 9000 kilometre is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example, with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year anniversary of the German-Chinese link was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis of the Pearl River, with its economic strength, is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse.
The next year they wanted to reach a total of EUR 250 billion in gross domestic product.
The family of Joan Rivers "expresses the thumb"
Joan Rivers has become a hospital in New York City three days ago since it was delivered to a hospital in New York City, but today her daughter was hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian recovered from her condition.
"Thanks for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We press all the thumbs down.
According to their mother, according to an emergency on Thursday after an emergency, in a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, the Mount Sinai hospital was delivered.
The doctors are deliberately hiding them and under careful observation, until they are more satisfied with their state of affairs, which continues to be described as "serious."
The reactions came from many pages, including in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Green vacuum cleaner and rising wages
In the future, more environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaner products that come into trade as of today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners are receiving from 1 September to a label on which the buyer can see at a glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, the value of the pollutant category "Euro 6" is more stringent.
There is also more money for scaffolding producers: They receive a uniform minimum wage of EUR 10.25 per year.
Amazon is selling Toppa for $1.04 billion.
Amazon confirmed just now what information was reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video production, and a lot of other things - buy the video streaming service Tswitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million USD).
The announcement comes out of surprise, not because nobody expected it to be over, but because it was widely assumed that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago it looked as if the sale of Tswitch to the video service of Google for a cool billion was done, and the cooperation also seemed natural.
Tswitch, founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravources in games, an "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The Twitter interface.
And "let's play," a video genre, in which better know the (mostly older) games a coat of intelligence theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just the case that YouTube is often called if you want to describe it, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy is a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology, which buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube has not arrived, since the company was reportedly ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it at the moment is that statement by Emmet Hashar, President of TTRN: "We decided for Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us move more quickly."
A further secret is, to be honest, the incredible success of Tswitch.
For Snobs like me who say that they prefer to practice sports than to watch them, it is hard to understand the attraction they are doing to watch others play in the game instead of taking control of the control panel.
It is one thing to look at a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning, while it is easy through Resident Evil, and something quite different, to watch a female shot in the head of the head in Call of Duty 20 times.
You could see all these games right now.
The other problem is that many of the most popular games are today's game, so the gain can be a good recipe for headaches without your own control over the viewing perspective.
I admit that the fast runs, in which the Roger banners of our electronics age are going through all games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as there is no playing or Humorvirtuosis, your Twitter channel is not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know as I do?
Tswitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly will Amazon make money?
It's hard to imagine that TOFF is so elegantly integrated in Amazon Instant Video, just like YouTube Tfast could swallow.
But TSwitch has something that every company would like to have: Thousands of young men being recruited as advertisers.
Like the head of Tswitch, Luke, Luke, said, Amazon and Tlockout, both believe both in the future of the gaming, "and the medium does not display signs of contraction, not even - sip - as a spectator sport.
On the Hüpfburg at the Burggarfest there was a lot of rest on the sunny evening.
The concept of the organisers agreed.
In spite of the strong rain on Saturday night, an estimated 1200 music fans arrived at the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the entry had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and Fun.
In two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name of Amula.
The Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten aims to shine light on the day and in the evening by various shows.
Well, and the fun is alone by itself.
This was already evident early on the morning when the first visitors went to the Open Air.
A festival for all generations had promised the organizers.
And that is what they have done.
Around the meeting points on the Burggarten meadow there was a warm welcome to Salzwedeler, but also to guests from the nearby and other surrounding areas.
They followed the first live appearances, teamed with their feet, enjoying cool drinks - in short: Pure relaxation and pleasure were required.
And that is right across the generations.
The white sand on the beach bar of the white sand on the beach bar, situated on the ceiling on the small white sand on the beach bar, planted the young at the hip, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But, even in the case of children, the volunteers literally had their hands full in order to get the people out of their lands and create imaginative creations in the small faces.
The larger ones took advantage of the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew set out to work.
Until the large rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he attacked the visitors, especially families seeking the space and drying.
But the attraction of the festival did not detract from this.
"There were more people than was expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of "success across the line."
That is why I do not mind a repeat of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked out, Sem made it clear in a first show on Sunday against the Women's vote.
He referred to the fact that, in the meantime, it had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company was booked with too little forces.
As a result, some people who had already paid would no longer find themselves on the site.
The feedback was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer of around 1200 visitors who died in the Burggarten.
Problems arose with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop band Blocksrück Rox broke their appearance therefore.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha-Loaders could not be built, because the tents could not be rotated for a tyre load.
"In the next year they will be," according to the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-open-air Airs was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes, which are still going on for the first time, but will have to be removed from the second edition.
Even in the social network Facebook, the organizers have to criticise criticism.
"Unfortunately, but for 12 euros one was simply expecting more," Melanie Meier speaks on the event page.
"You have unfortunately taken you a bit," said Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others are not so close as to the initial problems.
I think it is very good that some people are not only stupid, but also really trying to put their feet on their feet.
Hats off," says Stephanie Jenß to Amula.
Now the organisers have one year to remedy these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum:
This is not the case, as expected.
On the contrary, the assembled component is waiting to be used in the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the construction of the Tira Space Observatory, the shell, the so-called radon, is completely renewed.
The new wheel is slightly smaller than the old one in a diameter of 47.5 metres.
However, the size still remains the world record.
The final step for completing the new shell is the Kappentausch.
The upper quarters of the old shell is separated and reduced with a crane.
After that the last quarter of the new shell will be set up.
If the weather is good, the action will be taken at the beginning of this week.
Participating in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge is sucessful.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom shouted so much as her icy water was poured over the head that it violated the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge was painful.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after finding out so much in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge she had to leave the jaws.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK gathered as much as her icy water was cast over the head that she violated her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my pine was simply standing, "said them to The Mirror.
Ice water is covered by the 20 year olds.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that did not happen, the jaws was rotten, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister also saw it and made himself laugh almost into the pants, but I had to go into the emergency reception.
The 20-year-old from the UK was delivered to the hospital to re-enter the jaws after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Do the castle clubs once again work in the same way?
At the same time, there has been a number of times between the two Wolfratbishops of Burgundy.
Now think ahead of possible cooperation.
As an example for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former head of the Wolfratduke of Burgundy, led the project to the French Guédelon project.
Only a year ago there was no good climate between the castle and the castle lovers Wolfratshausen.
Up to now, the points of view on the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and possible reconstruction have changed.
Now the two camps are in line with each other: Negotiations will soon be held on a common approach.
The club leaders Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (castle's friends) confirm this at the demand of our newspaper.
"I called to Mr Piffl and suggested that we could get together," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all the members of both clubs could work in the same direction in the future.
That is how rapid progress has been made.
While the castle lovers around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had looked into the reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, the Burgverein um Sjöberg is at the forefront of the exhibition's "opening up and engaging in the event."
Herbert Piffl, the head of the castle's friends, has always been very pleased about the call.
Since her death, he joined the castle.
A new chairman shall be found in a general meeting in the middle of September.
Currently the club members are members of some 40 members, according to the 74-year.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we left the club's activities out of respect for the first time." This "phase of thinking" was necessary to "consider how to proceed."
According to Piffl the new chair is then going into the interview with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle's friends could also make a current mood within their group.
There is no candidate for the Presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find me," he himself does not want to stand because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new leader should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to work on the project."
The different positions on reconstruction will probably stay in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He appreciated Dimbath as "missionary," who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already well advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea was not an air lock.
Thanks to the high level of participation by the population and by volunteer workers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I too I was sceptical at the beginning.
But over the years I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push ahead with the project."
There is nothing else on the table.
Furthermore, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of reconstruction is not, therefore, intended simply to be taken over by me," he hopes, that the Burgverein may be somewhat moved on this point.
Its purpose is to document history first, "is important and good."
Then you could see.
Clever ways to economise on Unix books
Since the cost of full-time textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per annum, the Fast-Zweitsemesterstudent Matt Schröder turned out to be a clever saving idea.
He invented a loan system for books of higher students and offered nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book costs 180 $, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick--A-Keks, "said Schröder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
For the last semester, the last semester would cost $430, he told us.
He gave $120.
The collective administration shared with the students to spend on average more than $1,200 a year for textbooks and study material, but there would be a variety of cost options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are becoming increasingly the choice for the students.
The rental of textbooks is becoming more popular, and thus students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than buying them.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 university booksellers, has told that the renting of word books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that around one quarter of the books was rented in the College-bookstores in the last spring time, Mr Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are bought by the Trade Association National Association of College Stores in Campus-bookstores.
Here is the one-time one for the best deals.
Online purchase
Some new books cost only one third of the price for which they have to be in the Campus-book store.
The ninth edition of "Attachus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost 290 $, but can be obtained with the specialized book retailer Chegg.com for 239.99 $.
Needed to buy
If one does not make any of the other or normal usage tracks, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed for Chegg.com for 93,49 $.
Matt Casaday, 25, final student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book has been sold for $48.
Scholars such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts, at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether to allow previous spending to be allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the training work are not relevant.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
The rental of textbooks is worth a reflection if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you do not want to keep the books after the course of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could hire "Calculus" for the period of one semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the rules of the business where you are renting, including through the penalty fees, which may be used to write notes, submites or usage tracks.
Reserves: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees can exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
Even e-books rather than conventional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are rented in de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of major retailers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can hire "Calculus" for a period of 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, since many classics can be downloaded for free today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look at it.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the IS-BN number for the pricing of books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook for you.
And before an online order should be checked, according to the Guide, if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson I learned on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery, and finally paid the full price in the College-book store.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy"
"The Expendables 3" of Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Lady to Kill For" only played $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The film, "Sex Tape," designed for Cameron Diaz, played only $14.6 million during the opening weekend, while children's films like "Dragon Meaning easily made 2" also fail in revenue.
One article of the telegraphic film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the film's lack of quality could be the cause of the film itself.
Collin called 2014 as "the worst year," so far, for children's films, and described "drag-breeding guns easily made 2" as a pure "functional "fantasy sequel.
When it comes to movies for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly presented the average CinemaScore and Metacritic-Assessment for every summer film that was shown between the American Memorial Day and the July 20, 2013, and in the current year on at least 2000 canvases.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and points out that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix is the result.
Director Jon Favreau, who is working on Romney soon to work, said to the Hollywood reporter: "I believe that the times change."
We must accept this and not seek to emulate the past.
In contrast to the current weak cash performance in the Hollywood productions, Netflix recently achieved sales of $1.2 billion in streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales totaled $837 million.
Last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticised the film studios for focusing too much on films of comics, and prophesied a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could well contain a real core.
However, due to the potential cash register, which was expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of the cash results as simply "cyclic" and said to Hollywood reporters: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema bar, and nobody will worry more about the business."
A step in the right direction was taken a step in the right direction, a step in the right direction, a step in the right direction some years ago.
Now the German table tennis club has put an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
As a result, who has not increased, has gone off.
For example, in the coming season, the star's class supreme team Torpedo has avoided the decline, but in the coming season there will be only five fifths.
The fourth grade, Torpedos women, remains in the regional league, despite their grandiose passage into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Dutch League, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lengers and the Torpedo Reserves are in the new League League, the National League is not represented by the Diviner Club.
For the women, the TTV Geismar is played in the League League, the Torpedo-Second in the National League.
What's about the composition looks like a better county class, is now the new district top ranking south.
Here are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district league play as regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Rot-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III The district's official league of women starts at least in scale.
Psychterses, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with you.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllouausen start running in the district league.
The nine teams
The SC Weend sends its girls to the small district league.
Likewise, the regional league of the SCW-boys - or Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a county class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV are going into the season.
In the first season of the newly formed regional association, the two Manneringer County bands start with nine teams each.
In the west season the Rot-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengern II.
During the east-season, one of the most important events is Sattenhausen/Wöllmarches ausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Three League League consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllorf ausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than the Osterode circle, where there are no more ladies' teams at the district level.
It is striking that no one of the six 2.2 circle classes is to be achieved, the innovative and transformative circle chairman will have to think again.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, protests were held by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered to an Anti-Nato-March.
On Sunday, around 150 people met in Cardiff before the local city hall to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough spoke to us about the events of the weekend and spoke with demonstrators who travelled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Getting rid of the Blue Mountains from the Blue Mountains
Two young people were brought into safety with the rope wind after they were captured into the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke down shortly after Sunday at Govett Leap in Blackheath on their tour.
Worried relatives called about 20 o'clock the police, when the two were not back home.
A search trupp from local police and rescue services broke down and the couple was found around 23 o'clock near the Bridal Veil Waterfalls.
The girl had fallen to the knees and the man was overthrown and went down his head.
Rescuers stayed overnight at the couple, and they flew on Monday morning.
They were delivered in a stable state with a ambulance in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Saudi Arabia's Protective protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV-Building, told information minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter once again resumed the broadcast after almost half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the Heads of Government, accusing them of electoral fraud.
The police told us, about one kilometre away from the residence of the Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, once again, on Monday, some 3000 demonstrators have joined forces with security forces.
According to hospital information, a policeman was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured as demonstrators attempted to invade Sharifs's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military called on Sunday evening after a meeting in the army's headquarters to find a political solution to the conflict without wasting time and using it without force."
The message was referred to in the communication: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence is worrying about intervention by the military, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests taken by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Preacher Tahirul Qaddafi have been taking place since the Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to withdraw from the contract.
Khan and Qaddafi had called for their supporters on Sunday.
"We will not go down, without Sharon to resign," said Khan.
He expressed a similar attitude.
Khan accuses Sharif before the parliamentary elections to be held by fraud in May last year.
Qaddafi calls for the withdrawal of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the district.
Initially, the demonstrators were peacefully in front of Parliament, until Khan and Yahri called them for the weekend to invade Sharifs's residence.
Hrüdorfer after 2 season win at the table three of the table.
With the 2: 0 by Grödig for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday ended a conciliatory end.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate chief in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success story was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and Torguarus Steffen Hofmann, who three pre-met with Green White.
With the second winner of the second season of the year, Schramler Dream has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes hand in hand with the success of the country playroom.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory in the 14th minute with his magnificent leader Volley.
"I thought, I hau the whole frust of Thursday purely and blew him under the bar," the 26 year-old smiled smiling.
As a Schrammel on 13 November 2010, for the last time in a Bundesligapartie, this was still for Ried.
The first championship pool in the Rapid-Dress will therefore stay in a special memory.
"For me this is something very special, I am of the rapid young," said Schrammel.
Thanks to Mario Pavelic's short-term pool of Schrammel from the left to the right defensive side, he made his case very well.
He has enough experience that he is able to carry out this position as a mirror.
The Tor has earned him, he has done some Assists this year," praised Barisic.
The show shows the character of Schrammel and the flanks to the 2: 0 by Hofmann, after a very good one hour, finally led to the decision.
The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.
"Thank you, thank you, we have been a bit of luck today," also noticed Schrammel, who pointed out the gap between performance and result in recent weeks: "The results did not vote, but the playful was always good compared to last year'.
Barisic even admitted that "in many games it was better today than it was today - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season."
The first tripod since 26 July has proven that the team structure has remained intact: "Today my team showed that it is of character."
For him, it is no less encouraging: "that we have finally played back to zero."
At the same time, during the World War II, the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have suffered a lot of failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger's work, make victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget" the Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic the player "which was very stable lately."
The country period of opportunity must therefore be used to store wounds and make a bit of physical activity," explained Barisic, who has five U21-electrolytes in his ranks.
One that seems to be particularly suitable for the break is Captain Hofmann.
He fights for the team, goes beyond pain.
It is during this difficult period that he showed that he is a very important player for us," noted Barisic.
Hofmann did not only give the game of rapids in the 68th minute, not only the structure, but also achieved the second gate.
For the 33 year-old who completed his 350, the title was the first match from the game since 2 November 2013 (4: 2 about the admira).
Hofmann: "Cannot believe that everything is good now," "We certainly have also been a bit of luck, but at some point, the good luck also has to come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
He warned, however, that he continued to focus on his work: "You cannot always see it in black and white.
We have not played badly in the last few weeks, as has been pointed out.
However, we must not believe that everything is right now.
The importance of his role for the team could not be denied.
It is a very young team that I can really help at the moment.
They believe in me at some stage," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to blame himself and his team.
He regretted the rapid opposition from the Magic tor, as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute, which was wrongly recognized by arbitrators.
The only criticism I can make of the team is that we have not been specific enough to make Tor in a few phases.
We have had too few degrees in this respect.
Interior defense of Maximilian Karner felt similar: "It hasn't started badly, but then we have found and even made a gate.
By and large it would have been in the public domain.
There is Ruh on the floor
A powerful tribe showed us in our riddles of the summer series "My part of the Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these trees exist in the district, the extracted copy is the "Scourge � e" above von Unterweißenbrunn.
A steep walk leads up to the 600 years of old oak.
It is over to Koppeln, basalt stone clusters and basalt rocks.
A piece below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, is there.
It shows the natural monument, it rises above the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds one of the dimensions of over eight meters to an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But, despite intensive research, there was simply a reference to the name issue.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bishop's Hospital Archive and asked older older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what relief it was with the scourges.
The result of his investigation remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
So, until about 80 years ago, the goers of the goat had driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn from the labyrinths and the dunes.
At the foot of the tree, you will be told by the ascent of exhausted animals.
In the meantime, the region has lost its meaning, because in the meadows there are still goat herds.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve.
When entering the stone collections, one should exercise caution, as the basalt heated from the sun is also a popular place for crusaders.
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is hidden.
Further paths are signposted, climb the direction of Hochrhön and invite you to an extended hike.
Where is the watercastle?
A watercastle we are looking for for our next task is, however, rather rare.
There is already a good impression of the structure in the ditch, but we have some historical buildings in the district which could be adapted to buildings.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner happiness"?
My piece of Rhöner Glück
As with previous series of the main post in recent years, there will be prizes again this year if they have the right solution.
If you like to photograph yourself, you can also take part.
At the e-mail address red.neustadt @ mainpost.de you can send us the solution and also your personal "piece of Rhöner Glück" under this keyword.
The most beautiful photos will be published.
After weeks of tumours, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the Council, Matteo Renzi, won the nomination of his Secretary of State Federica Mogherini as chief in the EU's foreign policy last week, with the nomination of his Secretary of State Federica Mogherini, the nomination of Mr. Catherine Ashton, on the EU special summit last week.
Renzi, as the pro-government newspaper La Repubblica, looks at, as the appeal to the government team as a favourite fashion, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He is also expecting a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to calm the side of the left side of the left party again and again, because Mogherini is associated with it, albeit in a moderate way.
With regard to the conservative representatives of the Commission, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the Council, Donald Tusk, as President-in-Office of the Council, this is what the prevailing opinion is in Rome, so that a political balance is struck.
The President of the Commission, Mr Juncker, is the EU's chief diplomat at the same time.
The agreement of the European Parliament, which is still pending, is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) the nomination of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) hardly a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spread optimism, that the Mogherini, which has been operating in leading party offices for almost two decades now, has grown up to the "huge challenges."
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Its party career began in 1996 in the doctoral thesis of the youth organization of the then Democraticidi Sinistra (leftist Democrats), which joined in 2008 with the Catholic Center Party Margherita together with today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became a Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialists (European Young Socialist) for three years.
With the election in 2001 in the party council of the Left-Democrats, she joined the high party politics, working in the foreign policy department, whose director she soon became.
They occupied traditional Italian foreign policy points, such as the Middle East, through studies on the NATO operation in Afghanistan, in which Italy is engaged in a troop contingent, has established contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he moved to his Foreign Minister, Mogherini.
If the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which has contributed to the 40% of the party's voting in the EU elections in May, then, as in PD-parties, Federica Mogherini made a contribution to it.
Brussels, the new EU external representative, has too little diplomatic experience, so it lacks substance, is trained in the PD.
In Brussels, in particular, Poland and the Baltic States, Mogherini's distrust of the crisis in Ukraine is being pursued, and as a sounder "country friendly course."
It supports the South Stream pipeline from the Russian company Gazprom, which aims to transport Russian natural gas to the South of Europe via Russian gas, which is also the purpose of the Italian energy security service.
Following Renzi's tenure as the EU President in July, Mogherini went to Moscow for its first state visit.
Photos, which they showed with Putin at the Shake hands, were captured with indignation in Brussels, and that they invited the Kremlin's head for October to become a Milan Economic Summit.
Altogether nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This is a trainee, which has already completed another training in the company.
In four training centres, the new employees are active in the future: Electronic (three trainees), mechatronics (two), machine tools (two) and procedural mechanics (two).
All trainees come from the district Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Buchl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from 9-burg vorm forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel carefree and Sebastian Zahner from PFreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary or secondary schools and real schools in the first place.
From Wednesday to Friday the trainees of all year round and the instructors will be able to attend a team training event in Oberammergau, where one day hike and rafting on the Inn will be on the programme.
The company counts 950 employees in Germany, Germany, Germany and Germany.
The total number of trainees is 27.
The socialists in France should keep the mouth and bring France in order," said the most important ally of François Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided Left to show "their love" for the disputed socialist president, whose cabinet building was mixed with the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain on his side," he said with great applause.
As a soothing gesture, the Prime Minister insisted on the fact that his government will not call into question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite strong demands for easing the regulation of the site Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Finance.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his co-socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, has strived to the gearbox in which it appeared at a meeting of renegade socialist members and criticised the Socialist Party for accepting the French "faith in its future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, pottingly shook the Socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new Valls government would hold over for more than a few months.
François Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old not have survived a summer.
"And the new will also not survive the autumn or winter," said Rollulein Le Pen against supporters.
She reiterated the reputation of her party after a dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that he would emerge as the winner in early elections and be ready to join the government.
The ruling party of France was a defeat at the March elections and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the threat of disintegrating into several rival groups before the end of the 1948 period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and the rate of return.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the world's third largest crossroad supplier, led the industry's advanced negotiations for the acquisition of the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for around $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and to its wealthier customers, while competing with major rivals like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced earlier this week, saying the sources on Sunday and warned that the talks could end too.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to stay anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The Miami based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues stood in 2013, at $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the name of Oceania and Regent, together with eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise liners industry is about $29 billion, and over the next few years, it is expected, owing to the strengthening of the middle class, in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves on behalf of these new customers as the best choice for the crusaders.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise, in its present form in 2000, came into being in 2000 by a merger with a cross-road provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino company under the supervision of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, 31% of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares, and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held 8 percent in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise all have 82% of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original request documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the electoral decision.
A peking loyal group pushed the Chinese flag in the vicinity.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday, allowing only two or three candidates for leadership in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a Nomination Committee, which is expected to be occupied by pekingloyal members.
Through this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition democrats to be admitted to vote, and set up pro-democracy activists to make use of their threat and paralyse Hong Kong's financial center with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial theme in Hong Kong; and the party leadership in China fears that the call for democracy extends to other cities.
After the release of a Beijing White Paper, which proclaimed China's dominance over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands of people went to the business district of the city and a sit-in was organised there.
Lis interrogation is organized by the government in Hong Kong and China's liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Permanent Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice-Director of Hong Kong's Office of Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the leadership of the leadership.
Until the end of the 150 years of colonial rule in Hong Kong, Britain has not seen any democratic elements.
Putin requires Kiev's admission of "status talks" with the Ostukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin called for Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government is stopping the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country, starting negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory under the control of the separatist territory of the Ostukraine would be part of Russia, but that his status to Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to Kiev's government for negotiations on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy that he seems to have been pursuing since the beginning of the riots five months ago: Helping the separatists to absorb and put pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with the State TV channel Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to repatriate the territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, taken in March and April, after Moscow annexed Ukraine's peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently referred to the area as "Novorossiya" or "Neurussland," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary shining time of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who attack the elections on 26 October in the wake of the election campaigns of Ukrainian politicians, and during government groups civil communities in the areas of separatists, hope to attack in the near peace talks "in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to enter into detailed discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of the society and the state status of the countries of South-East Asia, in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed by Kiev's leadership for months, in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, said Peskov.
It is not a question of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Mr peskov, "because it is not about conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman on the correction of the "misconception" of Putin's remarks highlighted Russia's leadership claim in the way in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct attack of the Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants of ethnic Russians are ethnic.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the countries of Donetsk and Luhansk in the EU, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the period prior to the conflict gave a large majority to stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy mentioned by Russian diplomats on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine a power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control of an area that links Russia's territory with the Crimea.
The port of the Black Sea, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy, as well as an important trade port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostow region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that make important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, proposed in his speech on the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - by new elections - should consider amendments to the Constitution, which allow greater control over their finances and the status of the languages in the respective fields.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement to incitement is being accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders, followed by the further pressing of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks entered into the Baltic Sea region along the Azov Sea, after Russian troops and tanks entered into force.
The separatists supported by Russia were taken over by the man who, according to fears of Ukraine's security officers, took the first step of a campaign for the takeover of the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, the control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to enliven Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and urgently called for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership called for the draft further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, Speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, said to return to Kiev on Saturday in Kiev.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, trapped in Ilowajsk by the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parachute hunters who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
Nectfotoscandal um Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his annoyance over hackers, who would probably have stolen from Hollywood of his sworn Gabi Grecko and a Who's Who of the A Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of unique pictures of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have appeared in a hacking scandal around celebrities on the Internet.
The responsible hacker has more than 60 nude photos from Lawrence, star of "The Tribute of panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the female singers of Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
From the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were allegedly published private photos as a result of an ify story.
There are 101 Promis on the list.
Most of the last month, with Grecko, said to the confidence: "It is disgusting."
All private letters and images should stay private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "shameful" and that those concerned felt "violated."
The hacker has probably 30 pictures of Palmer with their former friend Scott Speedman, among them two images in which they are located at the top without in a pool.
Among the film works of Palmer are "Love is Unwon bar" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch yesterday were not available for comments on the chopped images.
A representative Lawrence Lawrence said of TMZ: "It is a odious violation of privacy."
Actors Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "Closed images from a mobile phone is nothing other than selling Hehlerware.
On a strictly legal basis, the propagandist images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and trekkers were on the Great Feldberg yesterday and they supported the "Help for Creole Children" association.
The tour, which was a Torture for the other, provided an easy workout for the other.
Everyone agreed on one thing: It has been fun.
Thomas Studanski should have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus was driven by the wheel to the Feldberg.
For the good cause.
The small muscle kater could easily throw away from it, especially as he has personally brought a valuable insight into the participation of the 8th cycle on the Great Feldberg in favor of the "Help for Crebliable Children" association" (Frankfurt).
It is a big thing.
"I know now that I can do this - fine!"
Small pists on the move in the applause?
Snow if I had to be stopped, eat it out from it?
Like Thomas Studanski, who is in charge of the CDU in the Oberurseler City Council, many of the 718 participants met yesterday in early tau and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the good 11 km long stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
For the first time, there was nothing to do with it, but it didn't work for me, but it didn't work for me, but it didn't work for me, but it's not a good idea!
Also he went through the track in a slide, as Nina Kuhn, Pressesprecherin the town of Oberursel, who together with Frank Grüneisen went on the way.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" is not necessarily a sporting challenge: "Here it is about Charity, here we are with us - an exit would have been done today," said Kuhn.
On the way, they had to hit Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) went to Oberursel in the morning to get back on top.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had moved to the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, so that he could then go home with fun.
Fun also has "Fritten-Toni."
For the chef of the Oberurseler cult kiosks, bicycle tours above the Feldberg are easy to do.
He had climbed 40 minutes in his 6.5-kW race wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to do so," said Andreas Balzke.
The traversed Mainzer says that he is a "ambitious racing bike."
He should be here, for he was on the way to the "Fixee Rad," which are racing bikes, but without circuit.
It was not just the 20 walkers who climbed up to the top of the summit, not just the 20 walkers who climbed up on the White Wall and the Fuchander to the summit, but also a jogging track, which took hold of an electric car with weights and weights.
For the first time, Dr Volker Lischke, with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and quad, ensured security, says: "The kenn" I from Frankfurt, who trained for a special sleigh ride, only that he pulls the slide itself off," the man is, to some extent, his own sleigh and the man himself.
The 718 participants - and, as many as before - had been sent to the track in the morning.
The trekkers first at 9.30 a.m.
It followed the first cyclists and runners at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers took off.
Then Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Radeln auf den Grosse Feldberg," gave the start commandos and wanted the participants a wonderful trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the course to the field mountain up to the security of the participants.
