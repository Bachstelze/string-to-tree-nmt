Refocusing on the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights
The Congresses Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as citizens' rights.
"As labor unions die, the middle-class jobs die," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and vice president of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
For this reason, I am proud to present, together with the civil rights portal John Lewis, the employee's authorisation law.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in terms of discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions and other forms of discrimination - and stopping so anti-union forces.
Supplementing the national labour law to create an opportunity for discrimination based on workers to organise a union representation in order to take action against a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the further sponsors of its legislative proposal suggest the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks suffered by trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and maintain labor rights.
There has been a time when millions of Americans recall that this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association.
When the United States, after the Second World War, encouraged General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarised autocracy, Hedki Tojos, was replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions have a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "the rights of workers on unification and collective bargaining and acting are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff employed the Germans to write a constitution that would make fascism replaced by Hitler by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers should organize themselves, and to raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause explicitly stating: "The right to establish associations to safeguard and improve working conditions, and to improve each individual and every profession or business.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to diminish it are null and void; measures to be taken will be unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which was designed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was taken over by the United Nations in 1948, as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors have a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join the unions for protecting their interests or to join them."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that human rights are human rights.
As a country of other countries, how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to establish a union - and that this union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and governments - should be protected.
After these rights have come under attack in America, it is indeed the case that the American ideal is to be remembered, so that the working population must have the right to join and make itself heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said, fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now all of us know that the workers "movement did not constrain the nation's power, but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has admirably created a market for industry, raising the entire nation at unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History is a reminder, and we should do that.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' organisations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that made America big in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judges Stop temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana may be forced to close down
On Sunday, a US Federal Court stopped implementing a law in Louisiana, saying to lawyers that it would probably lead to the closure of all five accounting systems of the state.
This measure, which was put into force by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June, was to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out abortions to acquire a patient approach to a hospital within a 30 mile radius of their practice.
However, the verdict of the judge means that doctors will continue to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to comply with the law as they seek to obtain these rights," Federal judges wrote John deGravelles in their judgment.
Within a month, a hearing will be held for the judge, in order to make the law a more permanent decision.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures, and said that doctors would summon more time to gain hospital introduction rights.
"Today's decision means that the women of Louisiana are escaping from an underhand law that wants to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chair of the Centre for Reproduction Right, which has taken the name of three of the five hospitals of the State to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear if the judgment had also extended to doctors from the two clinics, who did not follow suit and also asked for the right of introduction.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for non-constitutional.
Key areas of a Texas law, which would have forced most of the government's remaining clinics to be closed, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, say that lawyers "rights require unnecessary restrictions on doctors' rights.
Abortion activists believe that measures are designed to protect women's health, although some of them also welcome the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who conducts in Louisiana abortion, with patient entry, has the centre for reproduction rights.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to do no longer to carry out abortion, this doctor would no longer carry out the operation as a result of fear of his security, said the group.
In their arguments against the verdict, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortion, while their requests for patients' rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video clip online for her mother who died in 2007.
Women in rural areas of Australia have a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women, where ovarian cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25% five years after diagnosis was still alive.
The research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote areas of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDY: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer.
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-cases as well as social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote areas of the state, the mortality risk was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not consider why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan predicts late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as a possible factor.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly to be found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services to counter the distances, it proposed a possible remedy for strengthening the service of single-headed doctors, to give specialists the opportunity to provide women more widely to their homes, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, independent from geographical status, revealed a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and highlighted the need for better treatment and contingency strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013 Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast, learned an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden Centers regret declining home ownership
The decline, combined with an increase in the number of house owners under the age of 35, may cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if the present-day young consumers follow a survey of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times as the "middle age group for garden products."
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people spend on their own homes.
The rise of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular procedure, pre-gardens to park for parking purposes and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which 5 billion £a year in sale are converted.
In the metropolitan area of London, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products will be reported per household.
The HTA and the Royal Horn Society suggest that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that humans cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, a guide for the RHS, said: "Container-gardening is very popular with tenants, for example, because they can carry on their plants during a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden traders due to rising home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980 "s to the mid-1990" s.
It also projected an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Tibetan Tahirul Qadri, is continuing.
In the capital, Islamabad, around 1 000 demonstrators have patched the state television channel PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from PTV buildings.
The transmitter set up for about 40 minutes, but it is now sending back.
At the same time, around 3000 demonstrators attempted to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About one kilometer away from it, they were covered with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police set up tear gas.
The demonstrators ordered Sharifs to resign, but they reject it.
The country's army, meanwhile, is calling for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and using force without force."
After a meeting on Sunday evening, the military informed: "The army remains bound to its role to ensure the security of the state."
The military has played an important role in Pakistan, and has already spread more frequently.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accused Premier Sharif to have betrayed during the parliamentary election last May.
The protests erupted at the weekend after Khan and Qadri invited their followers to invade Sharih's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders a US diplomat for spy reports
The Turkish Foreign Office has ordered the country's most senior US diplomat to receive a report on US and British spying in Turkey.
Vice-President Bülent said that the US Embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that those of the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major activity area for US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries are facing each other each other.
An earlier report that also targeted Ankara's main secret service resulted in far more angry reactions from the Turkish Government.
Warning strikes: Guide leaders face the consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
As announced for 18 to 21 o'clock, the exhibition stand will be held nationwide all transport companies, including distance, regional and rail transport, and
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

Said to the district chair of the German Driving Guide (GDL), Sven Schmid, Düsseldorf.
We are counting on considerable losses.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The primary cause of the warning strike is freight transport.
The German Railway in NRW announced that it would do everything to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so that it was difficult to anticipate the consequences.
Police chief of Magaluf of Corruption
The prosecutor presented evidence of blackmail by the police and staff of Calvià on Friday the office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The police officer of Calvià am on the holiday island Mallorca was arrested after corruption charges of businessmen and barkeepers in the infamous Binge-Drinking-Hotspot Magaluf.
General Commissioner José Antonio Navarro has been arrested in custody for corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the road, most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutor provided evidence of extortion by the police and staff of Calvià on Friday, on Friday, in the anti-corruption office of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the allegations of corruption and were interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC reported that the angry night-bukers, the cronyism of the authorities, have had a serious impact on their business.
"It is no longer a matter of earning money; it is about survival," said one of the businessmen.
Let our livelihoods come from the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who performed 24 men during an Sauftour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have since tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcohol-dependent holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-bound barns.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatiovor took place, was forced for a year to be closed, while Playhouse and the pub pentour organiser Carging have to pay a fine of €55.000 ($73.000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents involving alcohol intake, including the trend of "balconing," when people from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions impeding flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has a winter surprise, with strong winds and strong winds, which affected Adelaide's flights from Adelaide's airport.
In the evening up to 9 p.m., a further 5mm rain came to the city, after 6,6mm, which had already been down on Sunday evening.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy Schauer, including a kiss which began shortly before 20 p.m. and ended in about 10 minutes for almost 4mm.
After the winter of last week caused an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell on Monday to a maximum of 15.8 ° C.
The weather conditions may have led to the late landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft should have been landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a Scherwind - a sudden change of wind speed or direction through a short distance - and had to start through.
Winds have reached about 50 km / h at the time of Adelaide's Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to launch a second landing flight and eventually set up at 20.40.
The flight delayed has resulted in delays of some other flights, including a Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C on Tuesday is predicted with possible spectacles.
Matthies: Highest time to the big Vernet
In view of the galloping technical progress that is threatening to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switching centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies is in charge with a highly trusted electronic accessory.
While I write here, my view of the spiral cable connects to the phone with the phone and I think Boah, how retro is that?
But there is one thought behind this: If the cable would not be, in a very short time all the headphones would fly in the house, and that would be significantly more retro.
In any case, this applies to ekeltronics (ekeltronics?
No, typos: Electronic) sector the rule that the world's novelty today is the electric scrap of tomorrow is bought - outdated.
If, for example, you still have a tube TV in the living room, it simply says that he is opposed to television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because, this week, pushing the Ifa at the radio tower to our absolute incompetence with regard to electronics issues.
The Laie, who had previously been blind to a washing machine and CD-player, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which will be distributed with impenetrable expert sprees before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yes, what is going on?
What are we to talk to people who apparently voluntarily propagate such Quark?
Essentially, for about 20 years, we have been talking about the fact that we are supposed to be linking our House.
So that the yoghurt is self-ordered, so that the fire alarm in the Maldives holiday on the Maldives shows that it burns in the working room.
And would it not be wonderful if we from the office out of the air conditioning our arrival...?
Yes, but this requires air conditioning.
But a dream soon will come true: We lift up our wristwatch, say "Saugen!" - and at home drives the vacuum cleaner.
Deliciously.
Everything works on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods become blurred," raunt an industry speaker, you can connect the washing machine with an earphone, the steamers send the weather report and the data glasses to show how long the pizza is still needed in the baking oven, which is of no benefit to us, because we stand in the stau.
We also know from day-to-day practice that if a new appliance is really needed, the battery will be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable will also survive the next radio show on the phone.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza.
Thousands of Israeli children from the region near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday, after they had spent the summer in air shelter, while roast and mortar fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of the school brought the communities of Israel in the south of Israel to a sense of joy and expectation, but the signs of the battles are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the staff of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a missile, before boarding the student grenatsplitter from the walls and crevasses.
"We have a bit of fear, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in the Kibbutz Saad and his English teacher.
Many of the children from our area urgently need a return to a routine.
Her 11 year old daughter Shani Bart said she feels "a bit funny" to go back to school again.
"These were difficult times, and we did not go out of the House at all," they said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz close to the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke last week, thousands of local residents of the border communities, such as Saad, left their houses or left their houses in order to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and to escape the fire-off and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community close to the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still hesitant about returning.
The Ministry of Education was divided, about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu went to school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza, which has been badly drawn by the Palestinian bombardment.
He appealed to the children, to learn a lot and said "we will ensure that their knowledge acquires and offer you safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided for an immediate end to the fighting; but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for a lifting of Gaza's Israeli-Egyptian blockade and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaports.
Israel is calling for a disarming of Hamas and handing over the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin again this month in Egypt.
During the war, more than 2.100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates of the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the leagues involved are fighters, but they have no concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4.591 missiles and mortars during the fighting at Israeli cities, most of them in the south.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza region, and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protected areas and the fighting continues, educational authorities are postponing the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be open again soon, so that we can continue to learn how the children in the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After choice in Saxony: CDU-Vice Strobl puts NPD-prohibition proceedings into question
In view of the annihilation of the NPD in Saxony, the CDU-German Federal Republic of Germany has spoken out against the Federal Constitutional Court for an end of the current NPD prohibition procedure.
Berlin - According to the CDU Federal Government, Thomas Strobl, the current prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end up with an end to the German Constitutional Court.
"The NPD performs worse than last," said Strobl, who is also the CDU-Landchief in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung."
That is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that makes me feel more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD is politically opposed rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed to meet the five% threshold when voting on Sunday.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party failed in 2003, because, at the time, the constitutional protection at the time was also in the NPD-tip informant.
In December 2013, the Federal Council received a new application in Karlsruhe.
The federal government and the Bundestag did not join forces.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
At the end of the year, refugees are now placed in tents.
The head office for refugees in Harburg is bursting with seams.
It is now up to the Commission to draw up three rounds of the Red Cross.
The local councillors have been informed only in advance - they have little enthusiasm.
"These forms of hatred continue to stoke the public and do not give local political leaders an opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, group leader of the Greens in the Harburger Provincial Assembly.
Your party requires the Harburg district administration to present unused houses for accommodation at present.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling are the rush of help-minded people - and the fact that the authorities will not be able to provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees, therefore, stay longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in Australia's capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
Because of this increase the total increase in June, July and August will be 4.2 percent, the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne drive a divided market.
The numbers of RP data show that in Sydney last year, house prices increased by 16.1 percent, but by 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six per cent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by the cuts in government spending, and where prices rose by only about 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lawless said that, for the next few months, with the beginning of last year, it would be possible to see an increase in the sale of property that would be subject to a real test for the market.
"When one looks at the ongoing high rate of auction prices, a general rapid sales rate and the ongoing low interest-rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further over the next three months," he said.
In an opinion of the new press, he contradicts statements by the leader of the negotiator, Peer Medau.
The style of the college, if not, is in the communication.
So, in mid-June, the Medau family was informed verbally about the university's request.
The statement that the plans were only known in July are definitely wrong, "said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-emptive or even decisions," but there is "preferences."
Even the construction of the narrow road up to the castle is less dramatic than it was feared by the Medaus.
It was a nine-metre-wide road and has not been mentioned.
The current situation is 5.50 metres, and this is one metre wider than it has been so far, "explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators, that their free and secondary parking areas will only be used in future by students of the college, Pötzl will not be allowed to apply.
It will not be pardoned at all, for now, as in other public parking spaces, it is possible to solve it intelligently.
Living the People of the Communities
The children's slide, which is situated on the grounds and which, in front of the front door, leads to the parking deck, should not be affected by the university president.
On the contrary, he suggests that this is not just about the crashing of children, but also about the residents at the entrance into the Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the nearby real school.
So Pötzl, so much more than about vested interests of Mr Medau.
If the criticism of the parent's board of the kindergarten, with the development of the road, "is entitled to a" of the few natural spots of Coburg, "can choose" the reader can decide himself. "
At the beginning of October, Pötzl together with the State Bauamt Bamberg will inform the towns about the development of the university by 2020 and in this respect the importance of the new development. "
Peer Medau informed the parents of the children's story last week about the Academy's plans.
Therefore, the access for the new parking deck should not, as before, pass through the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but through the Medau-Berg.
This means that the narrow road should be double-track over one kilometre long.
According to projections of the Medde, transport in the park of Hohenfels Castle would be ten times higher.
About 2000 vehicles are mentioned daily.
From the side of the city, there was no intention to comment on the project.
Glandorf is coming back from Handball-national team.
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31 year old from the Federal Government of Flensburg Flensburg-Handewitt resulted in particular health problems for this decision.
It has not been easy for me, and it has matured for several months.
For me it is time to listen to the signals of my body and to finish my career in the national team, "the World Champion of 2007 was on his Facebook page.
He works with a balance sheet of 167 countries and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement.
Because the wondrous backroom players for the Champions League winner from Flensburg still want to go to Torejagd for a few years, he is now no longer available to Sigurdsson for his new national team Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf marked a "long and good conversation with the Icelanders who visited Switzerland on Tuesday for their country matches against Switzerland.
His ideas and approaches have been as enthusiastic as they will inspire my long-time fellow players and my successors.
But for my Club I also want to be healthy in the years to come, and longer regeneration breaks are needed, which will not allow the current double burden.
The left-wing had to fear in 2012, after a ferocious infection, his career.
Due to Achilles "problems, he had been treated by the German Handball Associations (DHB) with a cornuclei which had subsequently triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other procedures followed.
Later Glandorf announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, who ended up with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national life are passing through a body without trace.
I have a few health sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three doses of infection, which took place at short notice in 2012, I have never properly managed my blood pressure.
To this end, there are some other types of wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that while I control my head, I am unable to fool my body, Glandorf explained the magazine "Handball Time" in the interview.
For a comeback, he would be available only in absolute necessity.
"When all the blades tear, I am always ready to talk," explained the dual family father the magazine.
However, I can count on one hand for the years in which I can play a handball.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I became rather humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, I want to go at least to some extent.
In addition to the championship title for 2007 and the win of the Champions League in 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and in 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In addition, Flensburg secured the trophy of the Cup winner in Flensburg.
Germany's economy shrank by 0.2% in the spring.
The crises around the world have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell from April to the end of June 2014, compared to the previous quarter by 0.2%.
This shared the Federal Statistical Office, confirming preliminary calculations.
Only consumption revived the economy in the spring, while investment fell.
External trade also slows down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual programme, a GDP increase of 0.8% is expected for the first half of 2013, compared with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste," which was first introduced by Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzfer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterland-Mooiste."
This is the biggest cycling route across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos for organizing this tour through the Münsterland.
Available in various journals, this tour has been offered to the public.
We come from Den Helder and are on the night to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland in this way. "The cyclists are happy about the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration at the Club sheim the Schützenatrix Sta.
Katharina went to a small "journey" through the city via the Wall, where the start was also made.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, led to Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 km with 1175 metres, 120 km with 1475 metres and 145 km with 1775 metres, cyclists prove their good condition.
They were cared for in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The organisers of Jos, Jos and Mayor Heinz Lölfing, were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for all concerned.
The organisation was without problems and there were no negative incidents, "Heinz Lölfing concludes a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not many participants, as the organizer had hoped, probably due to bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see us again in 2015 with hopefully beautiful weather on the 30th of August or during a different weekend," said the cyclists are going back to the Münsterland again and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Man's wake-up call to innocent memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony as a biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, political activist, ex-prisoner, has put on 287 pages in "monk and warrior" on 287 pages.
On June 1st, 1947, the Munich-based memoirs of Munich, who had been born on 1st June 1947, wrote about each chapter by means of an appropriate song text.
And he is ruthless in this: From the Onanie as a high-school to bonitebelling and drug use, he does not leave any human weakness.
Also, to show how he has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad areas also take to abstract, but all the more important concepts: Dear, soul, ego, being in now, spirituality - all this tries to go on the grounds, on a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and also how he has not only influenced the music (the opera lover becomes a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the asketic monk, who is "by subtraction" as he says, "by making all necessary things out."
But there are also short anecdotes about the earth: About chicks in a pub frequented by GIs, or a crazy car where they set up a tree head on a tree.
Here, too, he is ruthless.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was, worked in a factory and her relation was limited.
Henry worked for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, who were partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father, and from the series was built on radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies following the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, heard only his voice: "Listen to the collar.
Leave your sister in peace.
Walk away!
I want to see cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already up-to-date when I was a child - went to the pub and talked about things like the form of beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A lot of my life he was this serious type in the corner, who read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry made a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at his father's time, he won an insight into how life for him might have been.
It is slightly brighter, but they are dark, rough, deep-green labyrinths with flame and smoke.
In the past, my father simply sat in the bath and then he was able to listen to him slowly, as he started to sing, because he was able to wash the foundry.
When I ran there, I realized that he had done so for years to get food on the table, and my respect for him was greater.
Nevertheless, Henry worked as a child without the love of his parents.
My father hugged me never, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went badly at the end of her life, we began, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you say with the "I love you" stop?
Stop me to hug!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still French friends with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys's own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I was very, very obese and symptoms of diabetes showed, said my doctor "you must be radical.
So I moved this exercise through and also had to make a radical diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is demanding.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henrys career change can be found in his elegant, short-cut bart.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he is captured by the theatre.
It followed the comedy of the mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and comedies who filled up his busy working life.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated and wrote in New Faces.
His TV career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitation / comedian on television for quite a long time.
He learned at work.
I had to be big not just in front of the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, I learned how I could become an efficient wize narrative machine while I was a star by television, and that was really difficult.
Back in 1975 in New Faces
Since his manager had the stage law at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program, in which people become "black anmold", Henry recorded his comedy over five years.
My family was a very unpleasant thing to do.
I wanted somehow that it would never happen, but I do not regret I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on gigantic projects and learned how to treat a big audience.
But this "years award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
Through the introduction of figures, which both celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative Comedykreis in the eighties.
The first series of the lenny Henry Show began in 1984, and in the 1990s he was, among others, the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie boss!
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film rolls were present during his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought: "What's going on next, Len, because it all feels like it's just over the time or a little on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
At school, I had never learned something about him and held him mainly for a domain of middle class, whites in tights and a coal head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
All of us who interviewed for the show Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Do not make it bad if you don't know what you're doing.
Take a few words, and then you will understand why we love Shakespeare.
Henry saw 20 lines from Othelely last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I was able to do that.
It was almost as if I had finally put a head on my head.
"This is what it is, it is a serious thing, take it seriously, tell your text, to search for a bit.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car crash, and that simply did not happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of delusions.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed you."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me" You have to bridge 10 minutes while they fix the computer "."
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea would go on as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I am not responsible for it.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, therefore stick in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the eyes.
That too was good, so it is like a big sign of the gods saying to me "This is your destiny here."
He says this, of course, with a greeting voice.
So I stand by it.
I really love it.
I love to be in a sample room.
However, Henry is still the head of a comedian - our conversation is surrounded by humorous eruptions, while constantly imitating people.
I decided not to make a stand up comedy, because I think this type of immediate gratification of a room full of strange is somehow dangerous.
If you look at it forever, you will get a wall.
I'm playing live in the Apollo, if I like it, but overall there is not as much as before.
I ask him if he ever will make a stand up Comedytour.
The fun, which I have in an area with a director who is helping to make a start, a middle part and the end of a trip - I do not think I want to give up.
So what is his new incarnation here?
I think so.
I love to play an actor.
It is fun.
You always tell a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
The people love stories.
Huthi rebels are blocking roads in Yemen's capital.
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni Government, the Huthis has called into civil disobedience in the capital, Sanaa.
Huthi followers would have sat in Sanaa on Monday, saying a spokesman for the Huthi party "Ansar Allah."
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni's media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "BailPost," Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi was invited to take the action on Sunday evening.
Huthi, after supplying the leaf with a further escalation of the conflict, should not meet its demands.
The Shia Huan are fighting for more independence from Sunni-controlled Yemen, and call for the government's withdrawal.
The People's tribe of the Huthi has been besieging the Yemeni capital for just two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have built protest camps at the great access routes of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there is always a bloody fighting with the Yemeni Army.
Kenya registers civil servants to contain "ghost-worker"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials, in order to delete "ghost workers" from the government's pay lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay, was a government communication.
According to the government, thousands of people are still paying salaries when they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service in 2013.
During an examination at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700,000 £) per month was lost to payments for "ghost workers" and by other abusive financial practices.
The government expects that salaries will continue to be paid out to accounts, after a person died or leaves public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear in the next two weeks with identification centres to ensure that their data will be included on biometric registrations has been reported in a government statement.
All who did not delete this without a credible apology would be removed from the salary list, the communication continued.
"With this approach, it is essential to rationalize the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and eliminating the pay list at both levels of government -" ghost employees "have been eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary for decentralization and planning.
The scandal surrounding the art adviser Helge Achenbach will be first taken to court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi-Gründers Theo Albrecht, demand 19.4 million Euros compensation from Achenbach and two of his companies that are in insolvency proceedings in a civil process at Düsseldorf District.
This was divided by a court speaker on Monday.
In the Kault clause it states that Achenbach had been charged with the purchase of works of art and Oldtimern, and Berthold Albrecht charged higher than actual paid purchase price.
This would mean that the agreed commission would have been higher.
Achenbach have purchased a value of 121 million Euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
44 years he was at school, of whom 23 was head of school.
At this time, Manfred Richter is known as a pupil of Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a pupil.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always guided by his aspiration to see people in the student.
The snowlink is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves painting with the motif from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau / North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
After four years of secondary school he had been interested in the teacher's profession with 14 years.
One year after that the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave.
After several months in a camp it went to Bavaria, in 1946, in the freight car.
As a result, judges cut themselves into the Upper Franconian village.
Teachers training took place in Bamberg.
For this reason, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometres to the next station six times a week, driving the train to Bamberg, three kilometres across the city and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross Home in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first, and 1954 after three years of teaching staff the second state officer.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free education for him, he went to Oberbayern and arrived at the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Milling Room" was the first "comfort apartment" in the school building.
In 1958 he referred to a three bedroom apartment in addition to the school.
This House bought Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school was dissolved in 1968 in 1968.
Until then there were three classes and in Petershausen five at the school board in Petershausen-Kollbach.
Since the year 1968 / 69, they have been grouped together in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf School was founded, only primary school was in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification of the smaller school, the then Rector, Georg Sigl, moved to Karlovy Vary, and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers from September 1982 were able to obtain the present-day building which was extended in 1997 by Judge retirees.
Manfred Richter praises the straightforward generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who also built a workshop room and an extension of 1997 basement rooms, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very child-friendly," he remembered.
In his whole career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a leader who replied to a Department of Justice at a Department of Justice and Justice: "We must never forget the love." Manfred Richter replaced what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give children two things: Roots and wings," says the 84-year old.
He had to learn "he is not always there," whether he thinks only his pupils, or his own six children, is not quite clear.
In any case, Judge was sometimes unconventional.
When pupils were tested, they did not receive criminal work and they were not bailed out.
At the expense of the village, Richter had made two pairs of boxing gloves and let the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was to be a gap there.
For the good of school, judges served as Rector a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the party-less, after its retirement, to run for 1996 at least as last on the CSU list for the local council.
But judges were elected to sit for six months and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
Hr4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists move into the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scots stopover.
If cycling on your tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast, this is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of resting times made: The 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour together with accompanying tross enjoyed a pause at the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Rad and celebrate the newly discovered paths between Nida and Kinzig," participants took part in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert of Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday, it was serious: The cyclist took the first stage, the 60 km over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and continuing to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of mayor Hans-Peter Alameda, who had been with the bicycle with the bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the manager of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring, were welcomed.
For refreshment of body and mind there were plenty of good things to do: The rural women of Ram City and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, catchy, oysts and cheese-cream cakes which were wonderfully mundane.
"Such a cake can only bake the country's wives," praised an entrant to Aulendiebach, while writing another piece of work.
At the drinks stock of Geiss-Nida, cold refreshments could be purchased.
The "duo Bravo" stopped the visitors with well-known tunes from operetta and musicals, and enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
In addition, a head massage is made by his partner: "He deserves it.
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: They were interviewed on the fountain in front of the drinking cure of reporters Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Since the first 4-wheel tour in 2004, Mr. Hagen has been a tour manager since the first 4-wheel tour in 2004.
His pick up truck, where he communicated with three phones and a radio unit with his staff and the 15-person motorcycle stapper of the police, the police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check-in.
"The majority of the participants are from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in East Westphalia have travelled.
The number of participants is a little depending on the available accommodation capacity.
In Category I, the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collection.
The resort had a good impression when it resumed after one and a half hours: "Chüss!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" They waved farewell.
After arriving in Scots, the group was allowed to pause for a short break.
But in the evening the cyclist was called into the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had a beautiful festive atmosphere and, of course, it was prepared to prepare treats, such as flame creams with well-cooled spring white.
Mayor of Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC-chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as director of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen gave the dance stage free.
In spite of the sporting activity on the bicycle, the opportunity for the sparkling wine under the open sky was used on the bike.
Among the guests there were increasing numbers of people, who were just as enthusiastic about the good mood as the big circle of cyclists.
On the second day for cyclists, the stations of Birstein, Guardiensbach and Bad Orb were included in the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, athletes again met in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish policemen on "conspiracy" against the government arrested
A total of 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey due to suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," reporting local media agencies.
The police authorities did not give a direct comment.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking policemen, reports the Daily News.
Some of them have been involved in the investigations into corruption, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they allegedly founded an organised criminal association and called phone numbers.
Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister at the time) described her approach as a part of the activities that are directed by the Islamist clerics on him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school.
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents brought Premier Arseny Jazenjuk his daughter into school.
There, he told journalists that not all schools had been reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September parties were not held at every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian grass roots, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukwie, school director of the school in Slavjansk, who visited Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace and that children will be given education which will be useful to them in future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and keeping their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC might have found the great director it needs.
She meets with a proud glory in the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory.
It has its own head-on experience.
Their career began with the worldwide management consulting firm Bain and Co., which they changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of Pearsons.
She was appointed CEO of the Financial Times for seven years, when the top position of the parent company Pearson went to a younger male colleague.
It was estimated to have been nearly $1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
It was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former leader of BP, when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: She became adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is an old Tory member.
Back in May, I described the task of chairperson with a poisoned kelch.
Not only is the BBC as an enormous and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence is in two directions: From inside to the first guard of its own mania hierarchy in the BBC, but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong.
That provides for an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires full reform after full reform.
But what new president would risk to stand up to everything and to multiply an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while himself may be doing his job.
It is a difficult task.
And, as if that were not enough, there are still many interested to see the BBC reduced - power, money, and status.
As the competition approaches and new technologies threaten to threaten old, comfortable guarantees, the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC poses special dangers.
For the modest sum of EUR 145.50 a year, the British public is buying the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: They say that they have reached 96 per cent of households, and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And, apparently, the BBC rises up again on the popularity threshold: 53% support it today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I'm receiving news feeds on my phone today and I see better programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very dear and significant institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she has found it.
Musharraf from Texas says that lowered tweet was not authorized
A tweet of the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, included a belated remark on Sunday about the Democratic District Prosecutor, who is at the centre of a criminal prosecution against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was subsequently deleted and replaced by another of Perrys's user account, which stopped the previous one.
Just a tweet was sent from my account who was not authorized by me.
"I approve the tweet and have deleted it," said it in the subsequent message.
Staff from Perry did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although the tweets came from Perrys's official user account, it wasn't clear who actually took the feed.
In the former tweet, an unfavourable image of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned in April 2013 for drunky on the tax.
Musharraf put a veto against financial support for her office, when she refused to resign, which could lead to an indictment of Perry - who might be in 2016 presidential candidate - leading a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweets is: "I am not always drunk with triples of permitted alcohol levels... but when I do it, I make Governor Perry if he likes it."
I am the most sincere democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the review of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Musharraf does not say guilty, and called the charge a political ploy.
His top-class team of legal counsel applied to the case, to dismiss the charge, and argued that the law, which fought against the oldest governor in the history of Texas, is undisguised as diffuscient.
Musharraf put off 7.5 million dollars of public money to the state's Public Integrity Unit - located in Travis County, and in cases of government corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perrys's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
When he completed his presidential candidacy in 2012, when he completed his presidential candidacy in 2012, he said that he would stop using a tweet of a photograph of jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains housing market "normal" again.
One of London's most prominent construction contractors pointed out that the housing market in south-east England is "returned" in the south-east of England.
Vested homes in the capital were hotly sought and the subject of huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England, owing to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, to put down the ceiling for mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and president of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to regular transaction levels since the peak of 2013, and added that this provides a" stable operational environment. "
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Land Office, prices in urban areas rose by 18.5% over the past year, far beyond the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average sales prices for polio private, cheap, and student offers increased by about one-fifth last year and at the end of April to 423,000 pounds.
However, in recent months real estate ownership in London has made it less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have been deterred by the introduction of new real-estate taxes and political rhetoric about a potential "villa tax" before the general elections in May next May.
Last week, London's real estate agents warned that, in the second half of the year, in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April could lead to lower market growth both in property sales and prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday will show a decline in mortgage lending in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, a new real estate agency, corrected his forecast for the increase in real-estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3%, on the basis of an already weakened house-conscious mind.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter of a quarter, such as the broker WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due to end sales will amount to more than 2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at best locations has remained stable and, as a result, futures sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that there were 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost one-third more than to the peak of 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40 percent annually to £280 million, sales by 18 percent to €1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said, that revenues for Berkeley in the current year would likely meet current market expectations.
Analysts essentially estimate the annual pre-tax result to £450 million.
Berkeley shares were held in London in the afternoon at 23.96.
Naked pics of Jennifer Lawrence by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th oval.
Naked pics of the Mexican-American Jennifer Lawrence have been released online by a hacker who claimed to have a "Master List" of pictures of another 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star of "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker about "flagrant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who re-post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence Lawrence.
The images that were originally posted on the photo sharing site 4chan were allegedly sold by a gap in the online memory system icloud from Apple, the alleged "master list" of the hacking victim includes the names of dozens of young stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Wenger and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported Buzzfeed.
It is not sure how many images are real, though Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"Of those of you who take pictures of my husband and I took part in the private surroundings of this House, I hope you are so happy with you," Wenger wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "living" conceded that the photos were pictures of her and tweetete "These so-called nude images of me are fake, people.
Let's take a look at the beginning.
Buzzfeed reported at the late Sunday that a speaker of the pop star Ariana Grande the authenticity of the supposed photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly praised novel about love and the letter "J."
They were smashed, they could best be described, and they were slowly starting to wake up like a cardboard that they had in the rain.
Occasionally he said to him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distancing himself and perhaps a bit scratching.
And then shook his hand.
Scratzser knew him.
He has been stacetic, as in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this spying was a just beginning affair, which was more promising to relieve the lonely boredom of his life, and perhaps even had given him a degree of satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling beauty with unstitched hair and a flattering heart from a village on the north island, which even was even longer than the port.
It was accompanied by an older accompaniment to the south, who held Kessn for her aunt, and who inherited a land in a wet but paradise valley with the true name Paradise Valley.
For several years nobody had lived in the house.
The pipes were leck, in the baths were still spiders, swamps had their traces left on all windows and believed that they belong to them all, and the garden was watched with weeds, which saw huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a children's tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of mysteries.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose Roman "J" at the Longlist is for the Man Booker price 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had a hand with an Ailinn on the crumbling deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, which both had baffled at the service console, which gave the land with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, which his father had a long forgotten blacksmith shop in the home.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - Nothing was so properly banned - simply did not play.
It has been successfully rendered obsolete, as is the word 'obsolete'.
The general taste was what leaving and rules could never have done, and how the people choose to vote for books that are considered to be taken by the tribe-think-to-millionaire memoirs, cookery books, and love romans, so they have chosen the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kishn began to play an imaginary piano and honed his large feet in a coarse-comical Serenade.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"This was a famous song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he explained and put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done so to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It started as a match between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played with his own father, so he was told.
If you start a word with a J without putting a finger on your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was not very fun at the time, and it wasn't really funny.
He knew that he was expected to do so, that was all.
It needed to explain what was jazz.
Ailinn had never heard of any kind.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly banned.
It was no longer possible to improvise.
It was just space for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be quite safe at the beginning of a melody where they would end.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically sound.
Although he was aged 10 years without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he had to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she couldn't remember a time in which pop singers were not black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A structured company meant that each element of this company appreciated the principle of group gifted - grateful to the fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports.
People who were originally from the Indian sub-continent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were guided by the task to ensure that no family had remained without working staff.
What was left of the Polish community was about the seduction; what was left with the Greeks was smelling plate.
Those of the Gulf states and the Levante, whose grandparents did not abandon the land quickly, as the WHEN WAR, IF WE WAR, when they said that they were being charged with fire, fearing that the flames would eat them next, they thought and were depressed by the inertia of inaction.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since they had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it hard to understand how the insulting words that Kishn had just sung could ever become easier.
Music was an expression of love.
"These are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.
My father has never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the vast amounts of green leaves.
Ailinn still does not understand.
Why would your father have something like that?
He wanted to say it was a Jux, but hesitated in his presence to put two finger fingers on the lips.
She already thought that he was a little strange.
"It seemed funny," he said instead.
They are shaking their head and blocked Keaves view.
There was nothing more to see in the whole world than their reckless rabid hair.
There was nothing else that he would otherwise have wanted to see.
"If you say it," I don't believe it.
But that does not explain why you are presenting it with me.
It seemed to be honest.
Are my feet too big?
Once again, he looked at it.
Your feet so directly not.
Perhaps your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me, because my ankles are too thick?
Do hate hate?
Of course, I don't hate you.
That is just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason you make me fool," he tried instead.
I am a bit perturbed.
That would not be true.
It had to be comical.
If he tried to be comical, he often found himself in trouble, because he did not have the soothing charm of his father, who needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he, Kishn, he would be.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from their deck-chair, threw the console around and swallowed up the wine they had drunk.
Wine-ageing wine, so drunkness was not an excuse for him.
In their emotions, they seemed to tremble, like palm wedges in the storm.
"And your chastity head is exactly why I feel moved to you," she said...
Except that I am not.
They were sorry for both the uneasiness of his words and the fear that turned out to be against him.
Did it think that he would beat them?
They had told him not from living on the cold northern archipelago, where they grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and icy ocean erupted here as there, along the banks of the river.
The same confusing men, with even stronger skin and more tired skin after the WHEN WAR than they were their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always willing to raise a hand against a woman who refused or ignored them.
The head of the head?
They would have shown a thick fist if they didn't fit!
It was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the blacksmithing balloons from the console - they burst and then beat.
According to his view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the knee was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign with his body.
It arose from the deck chair like an old man.
She felt as well, but he was surprised by his grief.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew.
He looked at him as he turned away, just as he was watching from a room on the upper floor - a man who complained about what he had been summoned by him.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some of her hands had risen against her.
A man turned away from her to bow his back, ashamed, beaten, beaten, without fighting spirit - why was this a sight that they seemed to know well, if they could not remember for a single time they had ever seen something before tonight?
When they were alone, Ailinn's solomons looked on their feet.
Several years before the events which have just been mentioned, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for public mood, has been waiting for a short presentation about continued violence at low and medium levels in exactly the parts of the country, whose reduction, if not abolishing, were most likely to be expected, given the money and energy that had been invested in eradicating this violence.
"A lot of things have been done already, and much still needs to be done," they wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human friendliness has historically been experienced historically, despite the high-res cherry necks between the hedges, despite the high-rise cherries between the hedges.
But some characteristics stand out as indestructible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less passion it continues.
When listening to stories of over-forgotten difficulties, people dare to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and underhand-looking party at home, at work, on the streets and even on the game areas.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said their mentor when they read the whole report.
I suggest that you read less novels.
ESME Nussbaum rocked her head.
I also have to ask: Are you atheist?
"I think this must not say," said ESME Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
ESME again has its right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I do not ask this," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, reading or feminism.
This is a non-discriminatory workplace.
We serve a non-discriminatory society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can, at times, distort the results you have presented.
They, of course, have a clear prejudice against the Church, and these things, which you call "dearest" and "roh," could also be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a sense of strength and vitality.
If we continue to ride on it, WHEN IS IT IST, as if it had happened yesterday, means to take the country to take its essential vitality.
ESME Nussbaum looked at while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head repeated an LED badge in Flamingorosa the advice that Ofnow had granted to the land in the last quarter of a century or more.
Greet your neighbor, add your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk to you, say, listen, listen, listen to, excuse yourself.
Speaking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I really understand what you want to be," said ESME Nussbaum with a quiet voice when she was sure that her boss had said "and I say nothing other than that we have not yet been treated as effective as we fool ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in the same way as we repeat the mistakes that have been made in the first place to the WHEN IST, IF IS IT IST.
This time, however, it is not the other to let us cast our anger and mistrust.
Ancient Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with hands.
To indicate an angel patient.
"You go too far," he said, "if you act as a" mistake "that our grandparents may or did not commit.
They also go too far when you say that they would have left their "anger" and "distrust" of others.
It should not be necessary to remind anyone in your position that when we understand the past, we do not talk about 'us' and 'others' when it comes to protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "other."
It was a time of disorder; that is all we know.
"From if we are honest with ourselves," said ESME, "no part of society can claim to behave well.
I have no objection to that.
Whether it has been badly or well done, what has happened is done.
That was then.
There is nothing more to say about this - we agree on that.
And, just like no fault, it must not be blamed if such eradication is appropriate and if there is one way to eradicate it.
But to what is the past if we do not learn from it?
The past means that we are forgetting it.
If I may say something about this, I would like to say something about this.
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, when they went on to work as usual, they were overrun by a motorcyclists who described passers-by, in a kind of "brutal rage" at the foot.
There are contracting cases.
Lesotho-military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho were bent on preparing a coup d'etat to overthrow the government, saying that they were against policemen accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and informed that the country's army occupied his home residence and occupied government buildings in the capital city of Maseru.
The Premier brought his family to the adjoining South Africa after having reported assassination threats.
Military spokesmen Major Ntoi said that there is in fact no coup d "état, but the military responded to the threat of" political fanatics, "whose arming was elevated by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho ran after having received several secret service reports, that within the police some elements that wanted to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc," he said to Voice of America.
The Prime Minister of South Africa, Clayson Monyela, said that military action had the impression of a revolution.
"Even though no one has claimed to have torn down the government through violence, all the reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho are currently showing signs of a coup," he said.
According to the military in Lesotho on Sunday, the soldiers fell into their barracks and settled the situation in the capital.
Meanwhile, the vice-president Mothetjoya Metsing takes over governance during Thabanes's absence.
Thabane announced that he believes he has been targeted because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been major tensions since June, when Thaban parliamentary meetings were suspended due to conflicts in its unity government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, despite striking accusations.
Production in the euro area on a 13-month-rate
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest point of the last 13 months in August, so one closely watched study.
The final Markit purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after 51.8 in July.
An indication of over 50 gives an expansion.
New orders went back, and factories experienced breakdowns at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will take place before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The Bank is expecting a clear plan from the Bank to deal with the eurozone's sluggish recovery and the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could further indicate during the week whether it will consider quantitative easing for the eurozone, in line with those of Britain and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, senior economist in Markit.
The PMI factory for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell at the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic nation of the bloc, France, the PMI to 46,9.
France remains a sorgeny, and Italy's decline from a solid expansion into stagnation.
Note that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism of Germany, and in Spain and the Netherlands no longer take action, are also not reassuring, "said Mr. Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the forces of analysts that expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Captain Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing one can say for the purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry in the euro zone in August is that the sector is still growing."
He adds: "In the eurozone," producers in the euro area appear to be quite problematic to see the current increased geopolitical tensions, particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine, in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased uncertainty has made it quite clear that the economy is affected - especially, and consumer confidence, and it is likely to cause some missions to be delayed, or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said that it is "ever more likely" that the ECB eventually should start a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The grace period of the Beslan survivors: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children themselves are still suffering.
Ten years ago more than 1,000 people from Chechen militias were taken hostage in a school in Beslan in southern Europe.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had forgotten death in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the terrible siege of the Beslan school, involving 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors of the night faced a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatical Islamist terrorists of children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, captured and killed, it seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy of the West and East in horror, and then suddenly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had forgotten death in the classroom.
We have seen surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell is going to keep them forever.
Their Best Hope?
The fact that the war that Ukraine is now looking for - and in the children as she is dying - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb into the crumbling school sporthalle.
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Gäakov when she tried only in her underwear to climb into the crumbling school sporthalle after a mine exploded.
Following her mother Larissa, Aida looked confused, now 40 years old.
They were deemed to be dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run my life, but I could not say" said Aida then.
My legs were exhalated.
I stood up and climbed to look for my mother.
A soldier brought it to security.
After a series of operations, they found themselves completely cured, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I fear that I still need to be dealt with again.
Some grenades are still in my knees.
Your aim is to become a dentist, to help the people as they have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it has not broken me," she says.
"That is what happened to me, and that cannot be changed.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I will try not to talk about it at other times.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamed of going together to school.
"I don't want to marry until I start my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the remembrance of each year is somewhat weak.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horror and we are grateful for the help we have received from people in Great Britain and elsewhere.
If I see online the photo of me how to get back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to something that does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball is believing that his mother is dead.
It was his first school day (Russians go to school for 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me I should sit down if there was an explosion and holding her hand."
After an explosion he thought she would die.
She said unto him: "Run."
Full of fear, it could be dead, he fled, and saw a crying infant, seized his hand and fled through a ball.
His father, Vladimir, who joined his son out there, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said: "I could not save them."
In fact, Tamara was outlawed outside, with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn, believing that her son had fallen.
After her reunification, she said: "I'm crying out for joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran out and hugged me.
Damir was flown to London later (from the now unsolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by the then Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cheria.
"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop with remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will be in my memory.
I know that immediately, I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play games with shooting scenes and that is not a problem for me.
"I don't feel afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these children with whom I played in the courtyard and who did not manage it.
We never say that they were killed or dead.
We say they have remained in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially to the toy store, where I was able to pick everything I wanted, and drive in an above open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends have suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop to remember.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer under the abominations," said Damir, who worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I am happy to help.
I will one day go to the police and I hope that they will take me next year at the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could walk, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London, when I told our story.
I understood, then, how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her Foundation for the prize and opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cheria and tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and myself helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borshek and call all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant.
And that was just one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were willing to share and support our pain.
She said: "I always think that this world has not been better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war now continues, and every day people die and I believe that many children have been killed and still being killed.
These are just children like ours.
I think for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I do not know what these people feel all the horror.
And I can't stop doing that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir was big and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
He does not search for vengeance, for example, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know that he would not like to be remembered, but he has six close friends from the class and they go occasionally in the sports hall and ignite candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember, as he sometimes put on the sofa, the face of us dropped for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember how he resumed all his weapons and other military toys, but Damir is now 17, larger than I, well-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I am sure he is dead and I will never see him again.
When I came after the explosion and got on his feet, I saw myself, and saw the hell around me around, with all over body parts lying around me.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could not survive.
"I remember that I said unto him," Damir, run, run away, "but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard and he has gone away.
And that is how life, unlike that of many others, continues for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The Young, whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of Beslan's abominations
Comfort: The Beslan survivors Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, on the right, a picture of Georgij today
His blood-over face was inspired by fear when he burned his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dismissed him for his first day of school before she was able to bring her older son, Vladimir, to the university.
"I left the courtyard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy left for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date becomes, the more difficult it is to think and talk about it.
There is not one day on which we will not remember this tragedy.
We do not think it is long ago, I think it was done yesterday, some scenes from these days watch me all the time.
Nobody will ever forget that, I promise you.
Strong: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school this day.
I knew he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is this statue of the wining Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not look at the picture, and it is hidden in our house in the bookshelf.
I understand this, but I also think that, thanks to this image, people throughout the world feel our pain.
Georgij today said today: "It is important that this kind of thing never happens again.
"I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People are investigating such tragedies, and never find the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of these Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it caused?
This world will turn out to be a terrible thing.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, no one wants a war, so what happens?
Ten years is nothing like such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
About three or four years I had a few nightmares about the siege, but then it was better.
I went back to school again in 2004 and were afraid of every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That is why I always go to the sports hall when 1 September approaches.
I would like to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It is hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I must do it.
I do not feel as a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not paint myself.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I am going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgiy Faniev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was trapped on the feet of a murderous terrorist.
A miracle: Georgij Faniev was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorists, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was caught in the sports hall, sitting next to the bomb, which was attached at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is really a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel that it was yesterday," said Georgij, who wanted to become a secret agent to the FSB, but who could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, it's nothing I have left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with terrible experiences - I have to say that this is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and then felt a little better, but I can't forget it.
And I would love to forget.
2005 - in the year thereafter - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost awareness.
I will never get back there again and please do not ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous image.
Overliving: Georgij Faniev today, with a photo of at the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is incredible, and I bring him every day with me.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked for the school.
In my opinion, it is a good thing for me.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I could not study the FSB's secret service academy in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have sent my documents, including medical, and they have replied, that it is not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
They should not know about them and they should not be exposed to them.
His mother Marina, 42 said: "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse if the anniversary is closer.
I will go on to commemorate the celebrations.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It must be far more severe for him, because he was there and I did not.
I waited at home on him and could not help.
I am grateful to God that he was given back to me, and here in Beslan all of them are painted.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept this if there is something so unfair.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he cannot participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several occasions, he can run, but not sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50%, but we can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors have been killed in the siege, and that only increases my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is crying.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never been married again.
It is hard to accept that life will continue, even if that is not what they want.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are they fighting for?
Why kill each other with each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I cannot believe it.
We were formerly a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If we only seize all of these rebels and throw them out, we can go as far as we can.
Aljona Tehajewa, 10
The baby which was so close by a Special Encounter Command in Safe
Save: Aljona Tafawa is brought into security by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not recall the atrocities at all.
The world held its breath in 2004, when the baby Aljona was taken into the arms of a Russian police from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists left them, but kept their 30-year-old mother, their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, and his new wife Swetlana had a little girl who called Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown to an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare you all the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The best option is a watertight Point-and-Shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam, like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both for $300.
I have included these photos in a family booth with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Also, if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other trays are closed.
Add your camera to the photos or videos you want to capture.
Some cameras and campers have a scene and recording mode that optimizes the exposure time for the low-noise underwater conditions.
And before you jump, see to what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are allowed only for up to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.

Make multiple photos - because many will not fold.
Point-and-shoot cameras are equipped with an LCD with which you can compose images, Action-Cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it under water, and the right adjustment is a good thing.
So make many shots.
If your camera comes with a series mode with slightly modified exposure settings, make use of it.
Remain close to the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, the further you will remove from the surface.
If possible, you will still be close to the surface if you make recordings in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good Council country, but it is all the more important because of the poor light conditions under water.
It is especially important if you are working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed-angle angle, which means that you need to be more dense to your objects if they are to fill the entire screen.
Andrew Lawson was a guy of a variety whose character changed things even in such a gigantic organisation like the NHS.
As an adviser of anaesthesia, he dedicated his job to sparing sick both the agony of the disease as well as the vagaries of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and illnesses while the treatment was mostly done with something quite different: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the person who began his trial.
"I did not feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble finding out myself.
While he was fighting with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Juliet impatient.
"I would like to do it sooner rather than later," he did.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson was very unaccustomed to and worried about it.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray inspection were available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer, which is attacking the nipple, i.e., that the lungs are attacking the skin.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is often difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers fall into lung cancer, all lung cancers have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos burden - contact with the fibre substance which was once seen as a "miracle" but which has now been seen as lethal.
For most of us, Mesothelioma is a condition that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when industry voluntarily committed itself to using it no longer.
Also, where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the substance - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from a different age, it does not appear to be worrying today.
But this complacency is misguided.
Britain, it seems, is today witnessing the culmination of a Mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people are dying of this disease than in road accidents.
Annual figures for mesotheliopsis since 1980 and probable future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are now experiencing the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999, all asbestos types were banned), is that a mesothelioma is only developed after decades.
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and still is, in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a haven of protection.
The buildings of Parliament are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy, the initial consequences of this deadly carcinogen have already been identified.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor was he a plumber.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have been in contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks as if in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I trained for six years, a lot of asbestos was present," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and local authorities - use the tunnels.
You are asked how many of my old friends will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he could at least partly answer this question.
"By the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital, and over the last five years of mesothelioma, he wrote in 2010 in a letter," I'm the last person still living. "
How many of us will become ill?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long period of survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma are dying within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always leads to death.
So we can only repeat to Lawsons the question: "How many of us will become ill?"
The UK's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that, between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic is likely to come to a halt in the UK, there will be a total of 90,000 of the disease's victims.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die.

A quick look at the files of the courts in which those affected often turn to claims for compensation show how far the scourge of the mesmerizing is already widespread.
In June this year, Marks and Spencer, for example, gave way to Janice Allen mistakenly exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two sites - one of the flagship stores in Oxford Street.
Ms. Allen was 18 years old when she started working at M & S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesothelioma, I didn't really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "Asascform," a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as a white asbestos, is today by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It has been used for roofing panels, floorboards, pipe insulation, boom insulation, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other types of asbestos, but it will still be seen by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with the possibility of death.
Dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and pundits suspect that "there is a strong but indirect indication that this was one of the main reasons for its unique high-asset rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer has been exposed in the flagship store of Oxford Street, London, asbestos exposed Aley.
Janice Allen was probably not seen as a typical travertine victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that their story is far from unusual.
He has submitted a study of those affected by the fact that "an important part of the mesothelioma without known suspension through work or in the home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks as though no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, who looked at the Westminster Palace, shows, as people were in the heart of the government, unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service beds and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos from the rooms of Parliament, whose deadly fibres were raised by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members are often accused of caring for their own interests, but it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Labour Service insisted that the Western Front Palace received a "clean health certificate," it is now beyond doubt that 1 billion £of work needs to be spent over several years to renovate the parliament, to modernize the electrical installations and to remove the asbestos, and that, following the general elections of 2015, the Members will meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green banks of Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not being handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost.
Everything that can be done is waiting.
A person who has never exactly been able to contact asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott believes that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have been working in a hospital where asbestos cases have been approved positively," he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where you worked, and the data.
He remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he received such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he had a surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly I had crackling.
It happened all the time.
I felt terrible.
I thought it would no longer be possible to go home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the breast skin, the skin around his lungs, melted.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He went one month to work.
At the end of the first half of the 20th century, doctors made his chest and set up Pleurakathether to check out the liquid from the lungs and to test it in the laboratory.
His complaints, however, remained without diagnosis.
His health was slowly improving, and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often after physical activity and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient was diagnosed with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But now association Abbott does not do this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had been working directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's situation deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings into a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the ripp- and chest skin.
I am an optimist.
I do more often than just go on, "he says.
To be honest, I did not have so many concerns about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and the New Year: "They told me that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott
Suddenly, Abbott had meetings with Macmillan nurses, who recommended him to take a lawyer.
It is only now that he became aware of the scale of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widely used, especially in large public buildings in which pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesotheliom is now hitting younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos-insulation in hospitals were under the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many people living in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteen (as Graham Abbott often did) came with the greatest likelihood of contact with the poisonous substances.
It is apparent that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving patients, but life-threatening doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students presented their bunsenburgers on asbestos mats.
And it concerns not just hospitals.
Asbestos is often used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls due to its excellent insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools, too.
Indeed, many people have had the first test contact in the classroom.
All over the land, thousands of chemicals, students have parked their beer burners on asbestos mats.
Web pages often address the issue of asbestos in schools.
And, meanwhile, such innocent objects have included asbestos in our houses, such as floor plates or slipboard roofs.
"It is an industrial that is included in large parts of our properties," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who owned Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that struck an affected woman was the demolition of a horticulture in the 1970 "s.
So go on how to rip off your horseriding.
The effects of diagnosis, and knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I was going and had to take care of myself.
Well, I will not see another Christmas Day.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective switch from a doctor's position to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was from all the information he had to cope with.
"It was very hard to admit everything," he said.
"I asked my doctor" How long I still? "
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought "Well, I will not experience another Christmas.
That's what he said. "
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer.
Most of the cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of thin fibres.
If the asbestos is exposed and the fibres are inhaled, they can be placed in the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled nadelshaped asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a Heart-Thorax doctor, who moved to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital, suspected by Andrew Lawson that it exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasury knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach lung tissue, Treasure says, they are pushed to the edge by breathing, where the skin is.
From the very beginning it is from the very beginning an invasiv.
The usual options for other cancers do not work properly with mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly contested.
Some say that it is worth an effort.
Treasure denies that.
"You can not cut the breast skin," he says.
They do not come with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not say very good" on chemotherapy, "which" has an effect "but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live for a long time, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is struggling.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a One-Man Support and Consultancy Office for co-sufferers.
"Hello, Criel," he was cheerful at appealing.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would take four months and would probably only prolong his life by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to leave things in a more meaningful light. "
After consulting several physicians, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, the heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to be referred to, I simply called an appointment," says Graham.
A normal patient would have to obtain a transfer and wait for permission to receive treatment.
Money is crucial for Mesothelioma sufferers to be able to enjoy the best available therapies.
But if these treatments ultimately fail, many people are affected by another financial worry - about the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what has changed in the 1960 "s that they realized that even a very low level of exposure represented a health risk.
And here the negligence of businesses began to play.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually did their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called "full compensation" because Lawson was unable to prove with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to an Assurcontact at Guy's.
After investigating his death, a speaker of the Guy's continued to confirm that "the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990" s. "
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos is removed?
Indeed, it is for Mesothelioma sufferers who seek compensation, an enormous problem, the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually for decades after the events.
Many of their previous employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims, know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there was a significant new legislation this year, which makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to sue for compensation, even if their previous employers can no longer be found.
The Act has established a Fund of 350 million, financed by the insurance industry for all, which, after July 2012, had been diagnosed, can establish contact, but no one has been able to sue.
In these cases, the plaintiff will receive 80% of what a court may have been able to speak in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 pounds.
About 300 successful applications are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks about so many mesothelioma that 350 million pounds have been a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal for insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if time did not go over it, and Mesotheliom sufferers could find the companies and they could sue them normally.
Also Mike Penning, the Labour Minister for Labour and Finance, said that the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven death, a quick action is needed on a daily basis.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act last December.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he would have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This has been accompanied by radiation therapy and a chemotherapy - a three-way therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
That is something that we see again and again with patients.
There is something on which to move on.
If you enter, you will get worse off.
Graham Abbott withdrew from the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he lost the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Tattoos did not show any signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I have just been 50.
That is not life threatening.
That is life-abiding.
In addition, Abbott has retreated six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no longer any trace of tumors.
But the process is physically and psychologically demanding.
You have to think of practical things - about the money if I am no longer, for example, or my wife shows how the map setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
They must look forward.

"For parents it is difficult," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much.
When I was given my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I would have a disease with which I would not be aged.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and undisturbed.
She said it to their friends and we got very many calls soon.
Ellie was more restrained.
She said little.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients must get through.
But such talks are not overcome with hope for mesothelioma, not one of hope for survival.
For Stephen Jay Gould, the disease also brings with it a grim security.

China denies Hong Kong right to government, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament, despite the increase in calls for democratic reform, decided against the nomination of candidates for election in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate.
These are likely to be followed by the long-planned protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists engaged in planning and mobilizing to do so within a few hours of interrogations.
The verdict of the People's Congress of the People's Congress, on the other hand, allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-regulatory candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, Chair of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations during the election for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain's control of Hong Kong left China, Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants vote the government seat since 2017.
The Chinese leadership represented the Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives Hong Kong citizens direct voting, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the course fixed by a tightly controlled nominating committee, which is closely monitored by Beijing.
After a new clause, only candidates will be admitted "with love for the country and love of Hong Kong."
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong's biggest and most effective protests have taken place for many years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central, with Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to disarm the financial district if Beijing does not allow for true universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, in the space of a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters were gathered in the rain in front of the government's headquarters in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they planned waves of protest in the coming weeks.
They did not provide any information, apparently, in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers informed that the exercise "the occupation of the central county was considered only as the last resort, an action that is supposed to take place only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and the occupation of the central county will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing for days, and there were tightening safeguards, including police forces and barricades on Sunday, in front of the government building.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
Transporting people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Moreover, fear is growing that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech begin to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy-Central's demonstrations, as they are endangering the business operations - Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests they talk could cause great economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long they are going on," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has been critical of the movement for a long time.
We do not want to fuel fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media of China also recently reported about the democratic activists in Hong Kong than Western powers controlled subversive agents.
This summer, organised activists organised an unofficial referendum on the voting rights of 780,000 people - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of them participated in one of the biggest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school leavers in the United States is now transferred to the universities where Freshmen are offered performances by private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer Britain's first luxurious travel service for today's students.
To get a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transportation services such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said that the service had a safety record.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to transfer their belongings in a dangerous car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum of luxury.
A business speaker said that no new bookings have been made since the service was only introduced, but added that "students book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also reported that, despite the tuition fees of 9,000 £a year, there is a market for this offer.
Students today differ in their expectations and demands greatly from the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that precisely.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the US for Higher Education said: "This offer seems entirely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start this month are exposed to a crisis of living costs, because the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep pace with the soaring bills for the simplest basic life basics before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on the arrival in the student residence.
Feminists criticise racial issues and police behaviour after Ferguson
At the beginning of this month, the unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo..
The participants climbed their hands into the air and sang, "hands high, not shoot," while they were waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown noticed Miriam Zoila Perez a change in the online discussions white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators point to racial discrimination when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
While tensions in the Middle West began to gain attention across the country, Perez saw that the answers from white women turned 100% into a race.
In comparison with the replies of black women shortly after the conclusions of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "Think to Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I do not think that feminism contains many people who are above white and talk of privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to say something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnical that they have to express it.
For college professor KAlgoritha Mitchell of the Ohio State University, Ferguson problems brought problems to the light, which black American women are exposed to every day, but they are not considered to be "women's women" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes of all over everywhere," said Mitchell.
When I say something about how the color of color in your own country is under siege, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" She asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied racial, sex, and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the issues; they live every day in combined reality.
While white women are now linking racial and gender into feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men died, and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynching murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where the white fighter for women's right, as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the fight for electoral voting was only successful for each group: Women or blacks.
"You hit the decision to apply for the call for women's right to vote, and the right to vote for black should come later," said Hattery.
When you remember such things, one with power is aware why white women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to be organized against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group arose almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, said Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the wave of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police action, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time in which white feminists played "pangs" with the problems with which black women were faced with problems for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great, if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms do the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to check contraception?" Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation who build up their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steiner went two weeks following the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook, and published a prominent article of Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which they demanded more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another, but parallel, to understand an inherent danger to the body - and opinions on race, which are clearly different in public polls - will lead to changes," wrote Steiner.
Although Steiner is one for a rather intersectional feminism that addresses both racial and gender issues, some of their comments on racial hatred are perplexing in America.
May I say hello to She The People said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young coloured men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their previous critique.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently opened a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there have been angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem with the primacy of mainstreaming.
After the US border police took up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's south-western border this year, the issue of immigration reform is again coming back to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a new viewing of the subject as an essential woman, she only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of working visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a post hall in women's organisations," she said.
"Pigs House" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a property for sale was removed by real estate agents, showing that there was a big pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, located on a private street in Ipswich, and will be offered for 120,000 pounds.
To the details was a figure of the living room of the house - one of which was a pig that had put his head on a sofa.
Real estate agents Connells said the pig on the photo is the pet of the owner.
"The photo was accidentally published and has now been removed," said a spokesperson for the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former collecting house as an "unique detached house with one bedroom."
Although the broker is the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
Domestic sales were of interest to the social media when they asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey based on Lottogain is a new millionaire
A pilot from Harvey this month is this month.
The search for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth lasts, with a happy winner from the lottery promotion on Saturday almost $1.1 million.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey for the second time in five years won the jackpot in the first division after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner has to be notified.
The shop owner Steve Forward said the profit for talking material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing other, and all are quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could happen.
Eight WA-winners held profits in the first division last month, an expected conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August, after a married couple of Belmont had achieved a mega gain of $7.5 million.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said the profit will allow them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire of Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the gladiatorial arena
Not only the gladiators were held in the Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Roman day in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1000 visitors yesterday to resist the rain trolls and the autumn cold, and were completely impressed by the historic spectacle.
There was a colourful range of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the period of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Moroccan fighter force of the gladiatorial school "Amor Mortis," which used any rain break to demonstrate its robust fighting art in the arena with soft sand.
Gladiators "Leonidas" turned out to be a humorous and expert presentation and sent his men into the Ring for the heroic battle of various gladiators.
First, the "provocators" were on the series with a rectangle and a short coat as well as on the right arm on the left leg and arm.
The "Essedarii" was followed by a chest wall, a short coat and a neck and an iron gladiator, bass and armguard.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "RETIARIUS," which joined the "SECUTOR" with the "SECUTOR" and after a very long time fighting the burgers.
Here you will find a lot of interesting things to do and see for yourself.
But on the one hand the imposing "Summa Rudis" - the musculous referee, an always attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman day and make the culture of the Roman period a reality," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friends of the Roman Canal," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the park for a day became a "Oppidum Romanum," a Roman city, such as Vice-Chair Claus mourning in his greeting word.
After all, the Romans did not only bring war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and many buildings that we still admire today.
It was also known as the Roman day, such as "aqueduct marble" of the 11-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Roman canal bridge, which stood at the end of the day.
The Frontinus society was once and now faced with water and energy supply, and business leader, Petra Fricke, knew: "We are still taking advantage of the knowledge of then."
The certificate also confirms the degree of qualification engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "Engineering Team Two" from Rheinbach, the surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894, as well as brick from the original hypodermis, the warm-air warmth which the Roman villa used to be.
Impressed with the footprints that Wolf and Fuchs left behind two millennia ago, before they were burned.
In 2011, the office for ground preservation at the Landesverband Rheinland was excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Industrial Park Nord in Rheinbach.
You have found the conversion walls of an economic building with an Darre for drying grain and halving.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural good, heard the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations made it present in a glass cabinet, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels as well as parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa is believed to exist from the first to the fourth century after Christ until the fall of the Germanens in the then Roman Rhineland, suspected Morscheiser.
With her, the children also worked with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's millgame, or they wrote the name of the Roman students with metal fingers on wax boards.
At the booth of the Roman thermal farm Zülpich, the children were allowed to create mosaics, at the booth of the Rheinbach glass mosaic glass museum in glass mosaics and at the Eifel Nettersheim's natural center Eifel Nettersheim a heavy wheat mill from stone to put flour for bread or a muesli.
With the original Roman tourist cars built by two cold-blooded horses, visitors drove through the park and were also present at the impressive booth of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks."
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the town of Wachtberg will also be present in the eastern part of the city, which was called the Roman year 2014, which will recall the death of Emperor Augustus in 2000 years.
Together with their home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Association of Partnership and the Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes and the Roman history of Wachtberg will be remembered.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will tell him about his work at the high level of Wachtberg, presenting plants as living thinkers from the Roman period and offering a witty lesson in terms of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and ancient Romans.
The Adendorfer Elementary School is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project tour.
With the Roman week, the numerous, often but above the first sight of the Romans in Wachtberg, are to be explored again.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will be held at the gathering of the Berkumer Matron heiligence in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic strained West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned and international companies are on distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic makes Western Africa's economy a heavy blow.
The harvest is rotated in the fields, the mines are leaving and the markets are orphaned - the virus has hit the region hard.
Some international companies are already on distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis, but also an economic," the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit for the hardest hit.
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
The market only comes from who wants to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus alone, alone here the fever has killed more than 600 people.
Recently, health officials said that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
In total, over 1500 people killed more than 1500 people.
Foreign companies train staff from the beginning of the year.
Wherever resource-rich countries are concerned, companies use their operations.
Foreign companies, such as the Arcelor Mittal steel company, take their employees off, and several international airlines no longer fly the affected regions.
And local traders and farmers are also reacting: Few merchants leave their own places to obtain supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the export of important cocoa and coffee beans to the fields.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Foods will be scarce
"People will ever travel less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for Western Africa's economy.
The man, for example, who usually runs on the market and sold his vegetables, would prefer to stay at home.
So the population is feeling the consequences of the epidemic right and pressing: Food becomes scarce.
In the markets, supplies of basic food such as rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is at risk of image processing - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest risk is that international companies usually avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon from the French Think Tank Iris.
The most important thing is how far and how long the virus will spread.
With investors, the impression might be that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, "warns Hugon.
The disease also weighs the States "hard-headed national budgets
The disease also raises the already strained state budgets of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily strained by high spending on the health system, and in addition from the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the countries affected by USD 60 million ($45 million).
The consequences are already in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
So far, the oil-rich region of the southern Niger Delta has not been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are afraid of contagion at home.
Even reservations made in hotels will be significantly reduced.
To celebrate your 50th anniversary, celebrate your 50th anniversary.
The "Tannenwald" is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
The preparation for the 50-year-old foundation lasts from 12 to 14 September at the behest of the Tannenwald.
It is planned on Friday, 12 September, a great day of entertainment with the group "Dorfrocker."
On Saturday at 6: 00 pm the big boar shooting.
Afterwards, in the big tent of the night with the "Stoapfälzer Hochbuam."
Brass band creates music for the music scene.
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the big parade at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon, there is also the price distribution of the Federal Government and the Gaul.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 permanent dames with their dirndln.
The chapel is the brass band Berngau.
The patronage has taken over mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützenwald Tannenwald Berngau" was born in 1907, when the Association was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime, in 1937, had led to the dissolution of the Association.
At the end of 1964, 19 young men were found, who, on April 30th, took the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau.
Karl March and Adolf Ried brought the association as a champion through a difficult first time, in which the main concern was to find a local club locally and to install the firing range.
In the fall of 1965, the competition club in the "Leininger" was launched with two teams in the race competitions.
In the following years, the sportswear, which has meanwhile been organized in seven teams, established in all classes up to the 1st GauLeague.
For the first time in 1980, the club records have been sold annually and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached by Rudi Meier.
Just as an increasing number of active players increased, the membership fee has also become a positive one.
After the local "Leininger" no longer meets the demands of a modern shooter, Johann Rinn's management was determined to create a future residence in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof Härteis" in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis."
According to a working performance of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988 pastor Strasser for the new guard rooms granted the ecclesiastical blessing.
One of the biggest highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaushoot, combined with the festive pasture of the new protectors in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a Böllner group was founded.
Josef Schmalzl was awarded the Böller's reference.
A big challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the direction of the Bavarian Böll Meeting in 2005.
In many hours the members of the club have modernized the rooms and the shooting range at the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought to the latest state of the art technology.
Eleven teams in round-up competitions
It is also possible to see the sporting achievements of the competition.
In total, eleven teams currently compete with each other: Six air gun teams, an air gun team, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi degrees and Kerstin Cellar is in round 2013 / 14 from the top league (highest league in Schützengau ANB) to the Regional League 1.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauleague Nord to the top league.
In addition to the shooting range, there are events such as horse rides, carnival and royal football, club flight and Christmas party tradition.
The shooting is also part of the festivals in the parish church.
Tony Stewart suffered an accident in return to the racetrack.
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended roughly half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove for the second time against the wall after his right front ended in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that his 14-mate team is disappointed, but now focus on the next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we could have a better bet and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We are heading for Richmond, and we hope that we can do better there.
After a collision with Kyle Busch with Kyle Busch he had to leave the right side of his car.
"I have had quite good hopes for a good result today," said Johnston, and added: "It simply did not work."
Not long after the second accident, stewer's car was loaded into the Schlepper and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
There were three NASCAR Sprint races after his car hit and killed another driver on an Aschenbahn race in the north of New York.
He decided to return this week to win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit.
He returned to work, while investigating the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., which was put on the track during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities announced that investigations into the cause of the accident will last for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken on whether or not Stewart will have to face a charge.
The Three Champion was received with great acclaim when he was presented before the race.
Following the launch of the 12th position, Stewart had already penetrated the first 10, and was temporarily in four.
After a reboot in round 122, bushs got off.

Ukraine's army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
In eastern Ukraine the prorussian fighters are on the move.
After heavy battles, allegedly involving Russian armoured soldiers, the Ukrainian army abandoned, Monday, the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk.
The army also said that over the last 24 hours seven soldiers were killed.
Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, had already had personal consequences from the heavy defeat of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without any details.
EU-certified separatists

About 100 soldiers were injured or killed in fighting in the region of Donetsk, according to Russian agencies, according to Russian agencies.

NATO wants to break agreements with Russia;
NATO's planned deployment in Eastern Europe will not break its agreement with Russia due to the Ukraine crisis.
Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday that NATO was the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
But NATO's chief accused Russia of "a stark break" of the agreement.
"Today, we must face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO to be a partner," says Rasmussen.
For documents and opinions from the Russian side, they say "they see us as enemies."
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced his intention to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "readiness Action Plan" at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that we will have more visible NATO presence in the east, as long as this is needed, "said Rasmussen in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agreed to new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have, according to official information, agreed on new talks on their gas strike.
Negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, said the Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for a European Union to decide whether to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not had a fuel more from Russia for weeks.
Last but not least, the EU's Commissioner for Energy, Günther Oettinger, was mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had been warned, and Russia could also cut gas supplies to Europe.
Europe accounts for about one third of its gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks of power: Tolls will be "very clear" come true.
Now, once again, the Chancellor is clearly committed to doing so.
But it is not a licence for all complex details.
Stubborn concerns from the CDU against the toll of car tolls have raged the CSU in the near future.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken out of her CDU's ongoing resistance to the introduction of a car toll.
"Let's say it very clearly: It is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the leader in Berlin on Monday's meeting of the CDU's top committees in Berlin.
But, for the time being, a detailed model does not stand up for Merkel.
In the black-red government program called "certain parameters."
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal and is now working on it. "
However, the NRW-CDU persists on its "no" to a toll on all roads.
Merkel has emphasized, but finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) has been constructive in meeting a draft bill.
Moreover, with Dobrindt, he also talked about other ways to enable more private capital to invest in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
"There is nothing special about it," said a "mirror" report on Sunday, his home looked at his home to pay off his own concept to pay off motorway investors with tolls - following the election of 2017.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, Mr Horst Seehofer warned that he would develop toll-related measures against the leading minister in the Cabinet.
The Federal Government of Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement was never supposed to shoot all the circular and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian Christian Democratic Republic.
That being so, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that it will discuss the matter again.
Opposition to plans also comes from the CDU regional associations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
As a result, there are fears that tolls will interfere with narrow border traffic with neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had been calling for opposition from ranks of the CDU coalition in the ranks of the CDU.
The left view the plans in the face of the dispute in the Union as a failure.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of "The New Hospital's newspaper" (Monday).
"With the toll of the minister." Dobrindt wants to introduce a sticker obligation on all German roads, which will start in 2016.
However, according to the coalition agreement, car owners must not be subjected to additional burdens.
Therefore, they should be given full compensation for tolls through the motor vehicle tax.
However, the model should not discriminate against foreign drivers, under EU law, because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A britin says it thought as a result of misdiagnosis for many years that it would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in believing that they had only a few years to live after having been diagnosed with another illness.
She was actually suffering from the Charcot-Marie Tooth Disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damaged the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
By the end of the year, CMT UK reported that malpractice is a frequent problem for people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Around 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders, such as muscle weakness, an insecure path and curvature.
The disease is incurable and gradual, which means that the symptoms are worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she had a very poor chance of survival in Friedreich-Ataxie (IAs).
Rodgers thought she was sitting in the wheel chair before she was 18, and died her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: "As a child I knew I could not do the same thing as the others.
I fell constantly and everything took me longer.
I could never go with the other children's ski shoe or skateboard and was often moved in school due to my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 years after several operations to relieve their Achilles "eyes and spread their feet, they saw their health records when their doctor had left the room and read that they had an Igloo.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I did not tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA-Society," she said.
When I was given an answer, I was shocked and was shocked by panic.
I thought that I would be 18 in a wheelchair and aged with 25 and, in between, slowly losing all my abilities.
I made it myself with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, it became clear that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you have a lot less life threatening.
According to some genetic tests, their CMT was detected.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt as if I was a winner," she said.
The CMT UK has launched a CMT-Awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working since the closure of the former troop level as a fireman.
For almost ten years, there is no longer shooting at the former troop level in Münsingen.
Still, months of deadly ammunition are appearing at the heart of the Schwäbische Alb Biosphere Reserve.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown on the ground.
A deafening bang in the explosives over the heart of the Biosphere Area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot took place in Münsingen, where the end of 2005 was closed after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, 6500 hectares of large area is at the heart of the Swabian village of Schwäbische Alb, which is situated on 13 designated paths for walkers and cyclists.
Fiscal Receitists in the Washington Room rises with the economic recovery
An economic recovery means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax modesty for companies in the country grew slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, such a recent study last week, and firms in Washington space were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia pay collectively $27.6 billion in public and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
Last year, the state and local taxation of companies increased by 4.3 percent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent in the year, and it was the third year of growth following several years of falling shifts in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased higher than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the Ernst & Young service agency, Ernst & Young, with the centre for national taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the country's tax revenue, 56%, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of Italy's revenues come from companies.
Virginia stands at 28% with the lowest tax revenues from companies.
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery of companies "real assets, as the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7% this year, this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1%.
While a great deal of these gains from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process appears to be heading for Washington.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia pay more than $10 billion in state and local real estate transactions last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over one year.
But the apparent recovery in the real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in raising government and local tax revenues, as property taxes represent just over more than a fifth of the companies "tax breaks.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, the following is the following: A large proportion of real estate, especially in tax areas, is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
So, for example, it is forced to rely on income taxes to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real-estate market.
Company revenues also seem to be recovering, such as the data.
Companies in the region have reported income taxes in government organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion into company income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, local tax burden does not increase in all three places.
In the district, the rate of exit rate was 4.3 percent, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an underaverage tax of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6% in all three areas, has a far lower level of corporate income (all three have fixed company rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8,25 percent and in the district, at a proportionally high 9.975 percent.
A similar survey by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower state and local business taxes are being demanded and overall a better fiscal climate prevails than in Maryland.
In the study, the District was not investigated.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5% in the coming year.
If the government continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax by 2017 to 3%.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington room seem to be better off, and they are therefore paying more state and local taxes, such as the latest study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure, after which most small businesses are organized - in District, Maryland and Virginia, last year increased by 20% to $2.4 billion, a markedly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes in the whole country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in general, extra-rate revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 relative to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the Washington room could lag behind if the federal government's reduction in spending impacts on the region's labor market.
Sister town: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - even in China, a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt Partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a flight-direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt partner city Guangzhou - this is what official officials in China want.
"We would be pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said Vice-party secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Time and again the ruling Communist Party of China has returned to this concern of the Twelve-million metropolis in the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, which is also referred to as canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, and a Li.
That's why people also have the purchasing power to make themselves German beers.
The president of the Communist Party of Germany, Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, said to the host that he would listen to a potential partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer, it does not have much to do: Good water, cereals, and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party upper in Guangzhou.
This joy of life is already made up by Mr. Li, flattering it to the host.
Later, the business was based on Guangzhou with Schäfer-Gümbel - but with a red wine which was served to eat.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More commerce
A second desire of the Chinese host would be a flight-direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-party chef Li.
The Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but was cancelled for economic reasons in 2012.
"It would be worth it again," said local politicians.
"Commerce between our two cities continues to grow."
At present, travellers should take the detour via Changsha in the Province of Hunan, complained Li.
Even the administration of Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, hopes for the flight.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire to the fore during his discussion with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," answered Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Vice-Chair Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nodowed.
Well-being partnership
The famous Vice-party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year as a partner.
Li Yiwei was already on the main, but not yet in this function.
He came to office only this year, after his predecessor had been taken out of office for allegations of corruption.
The local party chief, Wan Qinglian, also had to go.
The action taken against officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which President Xi Jinping is severely enforcing.
The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before his party career, which is unusually unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
When he took office in Guangzhou, he worked as a leading functionalist in Fujian, where the car industry VW built a great plant.
Frankfurt is officially more than a dozen town-twinning companies.
The Guangzhou-wide connection to Guangzhou is one of the two sites which will be shared by both sites, such as school exchanges.
Last year, the 25 years anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
With its economic strength, the southern Chinese metropolis is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse.
Next year she wants to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "Clear the thumb"
Joan Rivers has been in a hospital in New York three days since it was supplied to a hospital in New York City, but his daughter is now promising that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from its illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said today in a message.
We all press the thumbs up.
According to her mother, in a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville endoscopy, in the Mount Sinai Hospital, according to sources, became a hospital in a clinic at Upper East Side, Yorkville endoscopy.
The doctors regard them deliberately and closely watching, until they are satisfied with their condition which is still described as' seriously '.
The reactions came from many quarters, also in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaner and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners who are coming to trade today, stricter environmental standards will apply in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from 1 September are being given to a label on which the purchaser can recognize central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars in the pollutant category "Euro 6" more stringent nitrogen oxide values.
Moreover, there is more money for scaffolders: A uniform minimum wage of EUR 10.25 in a federal state.
Amazon Buy Twitch for USD 1.04 billion
Amazon recently confirmed what information was reported on Monday morning: Online retailers and video producers, and a variety of other things - bought the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (USD 970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because nobody expected a takeover of Twitch, but it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch to the video service by Google for a smart billion was agreed, and the cooperation also appeared, of course.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general stream service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to play their brave pieces in games, a "YouTube for live matches," an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which better to give up the (mostly older) games of the art theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just that YouTube is often referred to when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wants to buy Twitch, a bit bored, is a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube has not come about because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything that we know at the moment is this statement of Emmet Snotes, President of Twitch: "We have chosen for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who say that they prefer to take part in sports, it is difficult to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others while playing the console.
It is one thing to look at a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning, while living through Resident Evil and something quite different to see how he is shot in the head for 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could see all these games now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are today's first-game games, so it can be a good recipe for headaches without your own control over eye-eye views.
I agree that the fast-track, in which the Roger Banners of our Electronic Age whole matches are complete in record time, are entertaining.
But, as long as there is no chance of a game or a humorvirtuoso, his twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know about?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And exactly what exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is elegantly integrated in Amazon Instant Video, how YouTube TMan could simply swallow.
But Twitch has something that each company would like to have: Thousands of young men who are called advertising.
As the president of Twitch, singing, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both to the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of contraction, not even - sip - as a spectator sport.
At the rear of the castle there is a lot of things going on in the evening.
The concept of the organizers agreed.
Despite the strong rain of Saturday evening an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the ban had to be stopped.
"It was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt-high l light and fun.
Two Spanish words have made Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem the name of Amula.
Because the open air in the salt-covered Burggarten is supposed to shine on the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun is anyway on his own.
This was already apparent at the early Saturday when the first visitors to the open air were opening up.
A feast for all generations had promised the organizers.
And they managed to do so.
Around the range of services in the town of Burgundy, they had been coached with saline, but also guests from the nearby and the surrounding areas.
They followed the first live performances with a foot in the rhythm, enjoying cool drinks - in short: Pure relaxation and pleasure were the order of the day.
And right through the generations.
While the one on the ceiling on a covered white sand beach at the beach bar, others are in a wine cellar at the Vinothek, the offspring at the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even with children's children, the volunteers were literally doing all their hands to become masters of the crowd and to conjure up imaginative creations in small faces.
The fans took advantage of the Kickertische or participated in an skateboard workshop that directed the Goodfoot crew out of salt.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 pm prasselte he walked down to the visitors, especially families were looking for the space and the dry.
However, the attraction of the event did not detract from this.
"There were more people than expected," Ron Sem said of a "success on all the line."
That's why a repeat of the big party will not be repeated next year.
Although there is still work to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made a first record on Sunday in front of the popular voice.
He said he was saying he had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently the safety company had been booked with too little effort.
As a result, some people who had already paid could no longer be on the premises.
The feedback was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the salt-gem co-organizer of about 1200 visitors took part in the Burggarten tumbled.
There were problems in tone engineering.
The salt-noble hip hop band blocks'n'Rox collapsed due to its appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably sound sound.
The planned shisha lounges were not able to be built because the tents could not be turned to salt-white due to a tire barrier.
"In the next year they will be present," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was more than successful from visitor numbers.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made a number of mistakes which will be repeated for the first time, but will have to be removed during the second edition.
The organisers also need to criticise the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you simply expected, Melanie Meier is on the event site.
"You unfortunately have taken a little bit of it," says Ele Zimmermann.
Others do not see the initial problems as narrow.
I think it is very good that some are not just stupid, but they really try to put something on their feet.
Hats off! "Writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now, the organisers will have a year to put an end to these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum
As far as I am concerned, it is not.
Instead, the built-in component is waiting to be used for its distinctive construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the establishment of the Space Observatory TIRA, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new wheel, with a diameter of 47.5 metres, will be a little smaller than the old one.
However, the size still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the Kappentausch.
The upper quarters of the old cover are separated and painted with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new case will be set up.
As far as the weather is concerned, the action will take place at the beginning of this week.
Participation in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge surges the jaws of the jaws.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom did so much when its icy waters were poured over the head, that they had the bone structure of their face-up.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge was painful as well.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had so much sympathy with the Ice-Bucket-Challenge, that she had abandoned the jaws.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK created as much as her icy waters were poured over the head, that they resent their face structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I'm doing, my jaws were simply standing," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is spilled over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth close, but that did not, the jaws were drowned, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this and made myself almost in the pants, but I had to get into the emergency.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was sent to the hospital to restore the jaws after taking part in the virals trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the Burgenans soon be joining together?
Last but not least, there was again a clash between the two Wolfratshauser castles.
Now, as far as possible, they are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former Chairman of the Wolfratshauser of Burgundy, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Wolfratshausen dynasty.
So far, views of the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and possible reconstruction have been somewhat different.
Now, the two camps are moving towards each other: They will soon be discussing joint action.
This is confirmed by the organisers of Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on request from our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and proposed that we could sit down together," reports Sjöberg.
In his view, all the members of the two clubs could, in future, pull together again.
So much more visible progress has been made.
At the end of the 19th century, the castle was built in the 16th century.
Herbert Piffl, Chairman of the Burgern, was very pleased with the call.
He has been a member of the group since Liu's death.
A new president is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
At the moment, the club is about 40 members, according to the 74 year olds.
"After the death of my friend, Richard Dimbath, we have been able to leave the club's activities out of respect first." This "period of thought" was necessary to think about "to think about how to move forward."
According to Piffl, the new president will then meet with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle's fans could also make a current mood in their group.
There is not yet a candidate for the presidency, Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to stand because he has his place of residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to continue working on the project "very much more."
The different views on reconstruction will remain in the eye Piffls in the near future.
He greatly appreciates Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, far-reaching projects in Austria and France, show that this idea is not an air dream.
Due to a high level of public participation as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I too was sceptical at the beginning.
But over time, I am more and more convinced that it makes sense to move ahead with the project. "
There otherwise nothing is there.
Moreover, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of reconstruction, personally, I personally do not just want to throw on board," he hope the Burgverein might be moving somewhat at this point.
Its purpose to document history first, "is important and good."
Then we can see further.
Clever ways to economize with university textbooks
As the cost of university textbooks for many students amounts to more than $1,000 per year, the Fast-Two-Year Student Matt Schroeder handed over a clever saving idea.
He found a loan system for books of higher semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay restitution.
"My mathematical book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Kek," said Schroeder, 19 who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The management shared that students spend more than 1,200 $per year on textbooks and study materials, but there would be different cost-reduction options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the scrapers are increasingly the choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly lower price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which has more than 250 university bookshops, shared with the fact that renting of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookshops were rented in the last spring spring, Neebos Vice Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks will be bought by the National Association of College Stores after statements of the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the unique one for the best deals.
Purchasing online Buy Now
Some new books cost online just one third of the price they have to be in campus bookshop.
The ninth issue of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for 239.99 $.
Buying Time
If one of the notes of others or normal usage tracks nothing, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduation student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a second edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics, such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors if earlier editions were allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older issues can often be acquired for a fraction of the costs for the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting holidays
The renting of textbooks is a reflection value, if you treat them reasonably well, remember to give them back and you do not want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the costs of a new book.
For example, a student could hire "Calculus" for the duration of one semester for about 20 $.
Inform yourself about the rules of the business you rent, even about penalties for writing notes, subcarts or useful tracks.
Renter: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
Also e-Books instead of traditional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by an electronic licence for a certain period of major retailers such as Amazon.com, Chegg as well as Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg, you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature often find the best deals, since many classics today can be downloaded free of charge, while scientific and scientific textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look at it.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price reference in books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check to see if the book is in stock.
This lesson learned the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in college bookshop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" did not get a cash deal
"The Expendables 3" of Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Lady to Kill For" recorded only $12 million of his budget of $70 million.
The movie "Sex Tape" directed at Cameron will only play $14.6 million during the first weekend.
An article by the Telegraph film critique Robbie Collin indicates that children's films may be the reason why they have a lack of quality.
In 2014, it was described as "the worst year" for children's films and described "Dragon thighs slightly made 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
In the case of films for a somewhat older target group, it seems as though the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average cinematic and metacritic assessment for every summer film start that was shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013 and in the current year at least 2,000 screens.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics, and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators have thought that development is due to changing visual habits and growing popularity of web-streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on voyages soon appearing jungle book film, said to the website Hollywood reporter: "I think the times change."
We must accept that and try not to go back to the past.
In contrast to the currently weak card results of Hollywood production, Netflix has recently reached an amount of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, with sales of US $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too heavily on comics, and prophesied a "meltdown" Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
In the summer of 2015, we expected potential cash-holders, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, but other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in the record results as simply "cyclically" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer on the cinema, and no one will worry about the business."
When the 2nd table of table tennis for tightening the Ligen classification was cancelled a few years ago, it was a step in the right direction.
Now, the German Table Tennis Association has put an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result: Who did not raise up, has gone up.
So, gods of the highest class Torpedo in the Upper League Relegation have avoided the descent, but will play only a fifth-class in the next season.
Fourth class, torpedos women, despite their grandiose cross-border involvement in the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo will start in the lower-class league, as well as the boys of the SC Weend.
The SG Lengders and the Torpedo reserve are part of the new association's league, while the National League is not represented by Juergen Club.
Women play the TTV Geismar in the Association's League, the Torpedo-Second in the National League.
What kind of composition looks like a better class class, is now the new North Korean league.
Here you can visit TSV Seulingen, VfL Seulingen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the regional league as regional representative Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the regional class of the TTC II, red-white, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III, the participants start at least in determination strength.
Cronies, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllnsausen will start in the regional league.
With the nine crews
The SC Weuss sends his girls to the small regional league.
Also the National League of SCW boys - there is still Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weend and Bovender SV go up to the season.
In the first season of the newly-founded region of the Region of the Region of the Region of the Region of the Region, the two villages of the Roman Empire start with nine crews each.
In the west season are Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglers II.
In the east season, Sattenhausen / Wöllkraausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen are playing.
The ladies circle is composed of Sattenhausen / Wöllkraausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weend and SG rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode district, where there are no female teams on a circular level.
It is striking that none of the six 2.2 circle classes achieve target strength; here, the innovative and round-running director will have to think about it.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds in the centre of Newport met an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people met in Cardiff in front of the city hall there to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has followed on the weekend's developments and talked to protestors who travelled to Belgium.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains flown out
Two young gay men were in safety when they caught the night through the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man departed shortly after Sunday at noon in Govett Leap in Blackheath on their tour.
Worried relatives called the police at about 20 p.m., when the two had not returned home.
A search bar from local police and rescue services broke up and the pair was found at about 23 p.m. near the Galleria Veil Waterfalls.
The girl had knees on his knees and the man had fallen and had turned his head.
Rescue forces remained overnight at the pair, and they were flying out on Monday morning.
They were supplied in a stable state with a ambulance in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Pakistan's Anti-Semitism Mahing
The approximately 1000 demonstrators have been pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister for Information Pervaiz Rashid.
The channel has resumed its wake after half an hour.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said, the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editing.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
The protesters are calling for the resignation of the Heads of Government to accuse them of electoral fraud.
The police said, about a kilometre away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on Monday, there was once again the collision of around 3000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
After hospital information, a policeman was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and over 500 injured as demonstrators tried to invade Sharifs Residenz.
They call for the Prime Minister to resign.
The powerful military, at the Sunday evening after a meeting of the army's headquarters, called for a political solution to the conflict 'without wasting time and using force without force.
Furthermore, it was referred to in the communication: 'The army remains its duty to ensure the security of the state'.
The escalating violence has fuelled the military's intervention, which has already become more frequent in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri followed since Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to resist.
"We will not go back without being forced to resign without Sharif," said Khan.
Qadri was similar.
Egypt accused Sharif to have won the parliamentary election last May with fraud.
Qadri is calling for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then an interim government is supposed to reform the electoral system and call up new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government quarter.
The demonstrators had, first, peacefully in front of Parliament, until Khan and Qadri called them down at the weekend to invade Sharifs Residenz.
After two years of victory in the championship, Kang dorfer ranked third in the table.
With 2: 0 about Grödig, for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday made a conciliatory end.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate rank in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success story was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who came with green-white to place three.
With the second round of the year's second round of the season, Rako-Dream Gate brings the right response to Helsinki's disappointment with the second round of the season, with a chance of success in the country game break.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said outdoor defender Thomas Schriel, who, with his magnificent leadership Volley from the sixteenth century, placed the course on victory at the 14th minute.
"I thought I had the whole gust of Thursday pure and quick it under the carpet," said the 26-year-old.
For the last time, as a stint on 13th November 2010 in a Bundesligapartie, it was still for Ried.
For this reason, the first championship striker in the Rapid-Dress will be remembered in a special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the rapid young," said scoop.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-range hood, he moved from the left to the right defensive side and also made his case very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirror.
He deserves his support, he has already achieved some degree of assimilation, "he praised Barisic.
Team shows character carts also provided the flank to 2: 0 by Hofmann for an hour that eventually took the decision.
After all, they could well write to the guests.
"Thank God, we've had some luck today," noticed, too, that the gap between performance and results in recent weeks has shown: "The results have not been voted, but the playwright has always been well compared to the last year."
Barisic was even better known in many games today - against "the strongest team that played this season in this stadium."
The first three points since 26 July have shown that the team structure is intact, despite the fact that the team structure is intact: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
For him, he is no less pleased: "That we have finally played back to zero."
A lot of work during a country break also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger their starting loads, make the victory even more valuable.
"One must not forget this," Barisic, who lost his last three days with Bernhard and Pavelic, who were very stable in recent times.
The national period should therefore be used to lick "wounds and to lick on physical activity," said Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in its ranks.
One of the things that is likely to happen is Captain Hofmann.
He fights for the team, goes beyond pain.
It is precisely during this difficult period that he has shown us to be a very important player, "Barisic said.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his confusion in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who played his 350 Bundesliga game, it was the first hit from November 2, 2013 (4: 2 about the admira).
Hofmann: "May not believe that everything is now" "we certainly have a bit of luck, but at some point we have to come back to us.
Now it was high time, "said Hofmann.
He would instead be focusing on concentrating: "One should not always see black and white.
We have not played so badly in recent weeks.
However, we must not believe that everything is right now.
He couldn't deny the importance of his role to the team.
It is a very young team which I can really help at the moment.
In certain phases, they think of me, "said Hofmann.
Michael Baur's coach, Michael Baur, had little to blame for his team.
He regretted the fast opponent "from the caster", as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute, who had been wrongly recognized by referee colleagues.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we have not been able to reach Tor in a few stages.
We have had too few degrees of success.
Inner defense of Maximilian Karner saw it: "It has started badly, but then we have found out and even made a Tor.
By and large, there would have been more in it.
Under this summit, there is a cry of silence.
A mighty tribe we showed in our riddle of the summer series "My episode of Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these trees still exist in the district.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree.
It goes past Koppeln, basalt and basalt rocks.
A bit below the quarry of Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, is there.
For more than eight metres above sea level, the natural monument stands out above the other trees of the surrounding area.
A small Buddha on a smokescreen indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But, despite intense research, there were only indications of the name of the day.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what kind of memory it has.
The outcome of his research has been the rather sober explanation for his name.
So far, about 80 years ago, the goat shepherd has driven her animals from Unterweißenbrunn out of the wondrous saws and stones liberated from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animals that were exhausted by the climb are to be rested.
In the meantime, the area has recovered its importance, because, in the meadows, the area really is reviled.
The area has also been declared a Biosphere Reserve's core zone, and Schneider has been able to find out more about it.
When entering the stone collections, you should be careful, because the basalt from the sun is also a favourite retreat for cross-liners.
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but it is hidden away.
Further ways are signposted, take the direction of Hochrhön and invite for an extended hike.
Where is the Wasserburg?
A waterburg, which is looking for the next task, is very rare to find.
The mirroring in the chasm already gives a good impression of the building, but we have a number of historic buildings in the district that could match the building's balance.
Where is our "piece of the Valais happiness"?

After weeks of tumours, Italy's prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has won the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as the head of EU foreign policy at last week's summit meeting with Matteo Renzi, who is the successor of British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, as evidenced by the government's local newspaper La Repubblica, considers the appointment of his government as Favorine as Favorine as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects an impetus for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to make sure that the left-wing party base, again and again, resists it, because Mogherini is associated with it - albeit in a moderate way.
Faced with conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome, is creating a political settlement.
The EU's chief diplomacy, at the same time, will be the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Juncker.
The pending consent of the European Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would have preferred the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) hardly a "important acknowledgement" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is widely optimistic about the fact that, for almost two decades, Mogherini's leaders have been proven and tested for their ambition to meet the "enormous challenges."
The native Roman is married with two daughters.
His party career began his doctorate in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats) who joined the Roman Social Democratic PD in 2008 with the Catholic center.
In 1999, Mogherini was appointed Vice President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Social Democrats) for three years.
With the election of 2001 at the party council of the Left Democrats, they moved into high party politics, worked in the foreign policy group, whose head they soon became.
They took the traditional focus of Italy's foreign policy, such as the Middle East, became popular with the social democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the US, through studies of NATO operations in Afghanistan, involving Italy with a troop contingent.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert on defence and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he headed Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If the PD is again a better relationship to the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to more than 40 percent of the party's votes in the May EU election, as stated in PD, Federica Mogherini is a part of it.
Brussels, the new EU external representative, has had too little diplomatic experience, so it lacks substance, and the PD will do so.
In Brussels, especially from Poland and the Baltic, Mogherinis has been suspicious of the crisis in Ukraine and diffused as a "country friendly course."
It is in favour of the South Stream pipeline being run by the Russian company Gasprom, which will be transported directly to southern Europe with the aid of Russian gas, and that also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi started his term as EU president in July, Mogherini traveled to her first visit to Moscow.
Pictures taken with Putin in the shaker hands were greeted with indignation in Brussels, and that they invited the Kremlin's head for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at EMZ-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes a trainee who has already completed a further training in the company.
In four training courses, the new employees will work in the future: Electronic engineers (three apprentices), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and procedural mechanics (two).
All the apprentices will come from the village of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Buchl from Blackach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Blackach, Johannes Beer from Ninburg in front of the wood, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel carefree and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl of Teunz.
The new trainees have previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday the trainees of all ages and trainers will be accompanied by a team training event for Oberammergau, where, among other things, there is a whole day hike and rafting on the Inn on the program.
The company is located in Germany-wide 435 and worldwide.
The number of apprentices is distributed all over the year, 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep the mouth and put France in order," said the main ally of François Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided Left to show "her love" for the disputed Socialist president, whose Cabinet of Cabinet experienced a rejection of the great majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty and deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain on his side," he said.
As a appeasement gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not jeopardise the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite severe calls for a loosening of the regime of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his co-socialist governments to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, transferred the sand into the gear, in which they appeared at a meeting of breakmen of socialist members, and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far right-wing leader of the National Front, failed to defeat the socialists and said that they could not imagine the new Valls government being held for a few months longer than a few months.
François Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, but they are forced to form a new government if the old ones never survived a summer.
"And the new will not survive the autumn or winter," said Rehulein Le Pen against supporters.
She repeated the call of her party for a break-up of Parliament and said she was confident enough to emerge victorious in pre-election elections and be ready for government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was at the head of the European elections in May.
A poll in Sunday's Journal du Dimanche showed that 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the danger of disintegrating in several rival factions before the end of the term of Hollande's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must feel fast, that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation will deteriorate further.
Seoul Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of €3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the world's third largest cross-platform supplier, conducts advanced negotiations on the acquisition of Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would include a deal with Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthier customers, while competing with larger rivals like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, saying the sources on Sunday and warning that the talks could end up without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also has a 20 percent share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked for being anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo refused to comment.
In Miami based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise liners on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues amounted to $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also in Miami, operates under the brand name Oceania and Regent, which together will operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to last year.
The cruise industry has a total of around $29 billion and over the next few years, it is expected to be in emerging countries like China and India over the next few years.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied for the IPO in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 deal 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its present form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise carrier owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a recreational and casino group under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.

Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the vote takes effect.
A measurable group moved near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law allowing for only two or three candidates for Hong Kong's leadership in 2017.
All candidates must first receive majority support for a Nomination Committee, which is expected to be staffed with shareholder members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to vote for election, prompting pro-democracy activists to perceive their threat, and to paralyse Hong Kong, with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has been a contentious issue in Hong Kong for a long time; and China's leaders are afraid that the calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which China's supremacy over Hong Kong was set out in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's district and organised a sit-in party there.
Lis's survey is organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice-President of the Office for Foreign Affairs of Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they will meet in the afternoon in front of the senior leadership in Hong Kong.
Britain saw no democratic elements until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin calls for Kiev to include "sovereign talks" with eastern Ukraine.
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports, on Sunday, that the Ukrainian Government is stopping the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and starting directly with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His speaker, Dimitri Peskov, later realized that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine, under the control of the separatist territory, would become a part of Russia, but that its status with Ukraine must be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy apparently adopted since the beginning of the riots five months ago: Help for the separatists in taking land and pressure on the Ukrainian Government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state television channel Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reclaim the separatist areas of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, who were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently been referring to the occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "Neurussland," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary shining times of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the wake of Ukraine's pro-election campaigns for the elections on 26 October, and while governmental groups attacked civilian communities in the territories held by separatists in the separatist areas, hope to have "in their illusions," said Itar-Tass.
"We need to engage in full discussion as soon as possible not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to maintain the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood in the context must be seen with the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only Ukraine's government can give the eastern areas the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
Clarification of the Kremlin's spokesperson for correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's comments highlighted Russia's leadership stance in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, unlike the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty than annexing the land of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the period before the conflict resulted in a broad majority in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and thus de facto control the Kremlin from an area that links Russia's territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region of Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries, which have important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on 7 June, Ukraine's president, Mr Petro Poroshenko, suggested that Ukrainian legislation - in accordance with new elections - should consider introducing amendments to the Constitution with which the relevant areas are given greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels who are accused of arming and murdering Moscow.
Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on equal terms followed after Russian troops and tanks invaded the pre-peaceful region along the Azov Sea into eastern Ukraine.
The separatist separatists supported by Russia, who, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, took the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, control of Nowoasovsk.
That is why massive civil and military preparations have begun to strengthen Mariupol, a steel mining port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is between Novoasovsk and narrow access to the Crimea peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leadership in Brussels, and asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, an old Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We're on the verge of" no return, "warning Poroshenko.
Thousands of troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU's summit decided not to take concrete action, the leadership required the draft further sanctions against Russia to come into force with an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donbas region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday in Kiev.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were included in Ilowajsk by the Russian invasion, were replaced on Sunday with 10 Russian parachuting hunters, who had been captured a week ago in Ukrainian territory, led Lysenko on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal about Australian promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his annoyance about hackers, probably nude images of his fiancees Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement, after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the internet in a hacker scandal.
The responsible hacker has over 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "the Tribute of panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers of Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
From the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were allegedly also publicised private photos as a result of a icloud gap.
The list includes 101 celebrities.
Edelsten, who had died last month with Grecko, said to Confidential: "It is disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, said reports according to a news page that the hack is "shameful" and felt that those affected were "injured."
The hacker has probably 30 images from Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which they are top without a pool.
The Palmer film works belong "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the pasted images yesterday.
A representative Lawrence said to TMZ: "It is a despicable violation of privacy."
Actors Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Glued images from a phone to post is nothing other than selling Hehlerware."
From a purely legal point of view, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
During the 8th cycle, riders and trekkers were present during the 8th wheel on the Grand Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the Association "Aid for Cretan Children."
The tour, which was one of the tracks, was an easy training for the others.
Everyone agrees, however, that it was fun.
Thomas Studanski should have been well-spent last night.
For the first time in his life the head of Oberurseler Brauhaus was driven yesterday by bike on the Feldberg.
For the good purpose.
It is easy to get rid of the small muscle cater, especially since he personally had a valuable insight into the participation of the 8th wheel on the Grand Feldberg for the Association "Help for Creating Children" (Frankfurt).
That is a great deal.
"I know now that I can that - prima!"
A little bit on the way out in the applet?
Snow, if I would have been waiting for it, have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Oberurseler district parliament, many of the 718 participants were in an early 20th year old with mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
By contrast, it was easier to overcome the 11-kilometre-long stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
At the end of the day you can see a lot of people from all over the world to see what's going on at the end of the day.
He is also a journey through a slide, as well Nina Kuhn, press secretary of the town of Oberursel, who, together with Frank Grüneisen, had embarked on the way.
For the two triathlon athletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "Here we are talking about charity, we are happy to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway," said Kuhn.
They had taken Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone through the morning to Oberursel in order to get back to the height in the morning.
In the morning at 9 o'clock, at 9 o'clock at the back of the saddle, the field "made" the Feldberg two times to roll back home with great pleasure.
"Fritten-Toni" also had a "Fritten-Toni."
For the head of the Oberurseler Theatre, bike tours through the Feldberg are easy to do.
He had been hit for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racetrack.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to do so, "said Andreas Balzke.
The trained maintainer says that he is an "ambitious racing company."
He also has to be, because he was on the road with the "fix" bike, which is also racing bikes, but without circuit...
Even without the wheel moving up, it was not only the 20 walkers who climbed above the White Wall and the steering to the top of the summit, but also a Jogger, who took on a Kordel an autoclave with weights behind them.
At the end of the first half of the 20th century, Professor Volker Lischke, with his team, equipped with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, called for safety, said: "The kenn" I from Frankfurt, who trains for a special saucer, only one of his own sleews, "the man is, therefore, his own sledgehead.
The 718 participants - and as many as ever before - were sent to the route in the morning.
First of all, the trekkers are at 9.30 am.
Followed by the first cyclists and runners at 10 am.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers got off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the Association "Rads on the Great Field Mountain," gave the start command and wish the participants a beautiful trip.
For next year, he would hope to close down the route to the field, to the safety of the participants.
