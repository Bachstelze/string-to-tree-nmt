Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very amicable.
The two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting is also intended to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution that has been discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's continued settlement of settlements and poses a lack of will in the peace process.
Obama's bid for Iran's nuclear program has made the relationship between the two worse.
In March, Netanyahu held a controversial speech before the US Congress, which was partly viewed as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not discussed with Obama, a meeting that was rejected by reference to the forthcoming elections in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor, his girlfriend shot to have been shot.
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" is still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
In the house the officials found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was hung on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he
There was no indication that Lamb, who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already spent 300 miles on the school grounds, where, according to the police, he was shot and killed by a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University of Polister Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18.
He said that lamb made the fateful emergency call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day there was another death.
A day after the shootings in the university, which forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators on both ends of the state, like the students and employees who knew him, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said that they were happy with their teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said that he did not have a history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both of them were taught in the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, whose teachers included 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time there were some inclinations of problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that lamb told him that he had stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for an exam for health reasons, saying that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard would not provide him with a guarantee of an automatic way to recruit as an Assistant Professor.
University President William LaForge said that he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs."
These are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lambs when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the back of a house around a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County told Methel Johnson.
His car ran in the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began in 2009 its work at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants, teaching geography and pedagogy.
He received his PhD in Pedagogy in the spring.
One of the longtime girlfriends called him to be intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla hairston said that she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her to play the guitar.
He was at that time the warm welcome of women.
All girls swear when they were there," said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency call lamb "I have killed my wife," but there was no document of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which borders on a Bait in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail appeared on a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played together one or another.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a Barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a low-illuminated bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and oral harmonica before ending a little audience.
There was no sign that something was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were in front of each other.
I think they had a good sense of shame.
Schmidt, the dead professor, directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in the Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening, at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, some 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and members of the community, participated in a candlelight celebration.
Schmidts's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial, during the "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Classes will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to persuade our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The associated press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect the fact that the police are now saying that lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and the lamb in his emergency call was called Prentiss as his wife, but did not indicate that the two had ever been married.
Toys R Us plans to recruit fewer workers for the Christmas season.
Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas employees as last year, but the toy and baby product vendor says that he will give the employees and seasonal workers a chance of working more hours.
The company said that it plans to recruit 40,000 people in shops and sales centres all over the country.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month will start with job interviews and the number of employees is rising from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to provide shops with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "Date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great time for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were waiting in the theater for the royalty, and I notice that the seat is empty next to me, and it is becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated pot and an arm length of being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future" presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" was premiered 30 years ago.
"It is for me really," said Spielberg, "the greatest film of time has ever been filmed."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN boss says that there is no military solution in Syria.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's reinforced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of almost five years of conflict, and more weapons will only make violence and misery worse for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the Council's five permanent member nations - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France - at the margins of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they showed in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others have dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But, as some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump off the top ranks of polls, it has not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump in the double-digit area, and some are beginning to ask themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate.
Of course, it is too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was delivered to the rising Herman Cain, none of which won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsiders like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's resilience and begin to push their dollar to topple it.
Here are some recent poll ratings that suggest that real estate Mogul is not just a temporary phase.
Trump's popularity ratings have been around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll by the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the Real Estate Mogul positively.
By mid-July it was 40%.
In early August it was 52%.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are held in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60% of the Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters, GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a poll by CNN / ORC last week, 67% of the Republicans said that they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" when Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say that they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they were "excited" vs. 40%, who say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they are "dissatisfied" or "upset" when Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of the Republicans see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52% of Irish voters believe that real estate Mogul has the right temperament for a president, as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies to the first pre-election state of the nation, the State of Iowa, where the same 52% of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 per cent think that he did not have the personality to carry out his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 say that his temperament does not fit into the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set their vow, Republican voters are holding Trump for real.
When they are asked who will win the GOP nomination, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
That is a change since the time when four out of ten in July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination only 28% for the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, it is clear that a large number of GOP voters regard Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gather for another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is distributed over a dozen of other candidates.
But a poll by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping majority support.
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina 13 points, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have formed their views.
A new survey by CBS /NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have cast their votes firmly.
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say that they can never change their minds.
46% said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates.
Yet Trump's strongest competitor at the moment of the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the subject of immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump was calling immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his election campaign two months ago, immigration was the focus of public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep critical Hispano Americans out of the Republican Party and will damage rebalancing efforts.
But, according to Monday's new CF/Post survey, six out of 10 Republicans say that they are in line with Trump on issues of immigration.
So, as long as immigration remains in the limelight, it seems to be Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government is rising to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, particularly through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Montag survey of ABC, they rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, with 54% "dissatisfied" and 21% "hellish anger."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany.
Here in Hobookenweg you will find the most expensive residential area with views of the North Sea.
In the street a square meter of a building of a roof costs a cut of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," says the study - that is to say the high price.
A new study shows how one square meter costs the most of a square meter.
Of course, EUR 18.70 per square metre for a Studentenbude in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top homes, one of the prices is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square prices at dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros per square metre.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way, for once, Munich is not at the top.
Champions League: Bavaria's dream starts thanks to Müller and Götze.
Two characters in Piraeus: Bavaria-star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for a well-earned 3: 0 at Olympiakos Piraeus.
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season.
The World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the cauldron of Piraeus.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won the game of play in the Champions League at the Greek record-master Olympics in hot atmosphere, thanks to Müller's double pack (52/90th) and idols (89th).
The twelfth victory in the series is supposed to be the first step towards the final of May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.
Müller received his 28th hit in the Champions League for the Bavaria leadership with the support of Olympiakos Torwart Roberto, who was allowed to pass through a world championship that was supposed to be a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm before the match in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31.688.
They showed a focused and committed vision without being brilliant.
Piraeus won its most recent six domestic games in the premier class, including well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Turin.
In 2011 there was also Borussia Dortmund (1: 3).
But the Bavaria, seven Europacup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were brave, but in their offensive efforts they often became unimaginative.
The attacks were too often initiated by a shift on the left on the left of the left, Douglas Costa, who rarely got through the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
From the right, Müller had more luck than his flank from the right half-field on the left upper toreck.
In the 67th minute the World Champion gave up the possible 2: 0.
The best opportunities in half had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat the head of Poland from the line (26).
Then by direct receipt, the goalkeeper Roberto with the knee (35).
Although Bavaria used to take up the dominant game, Piraeus was able to set the needle.
At the end of the season there was a lot of fun to do.
For example, when he shot a shot of Ideye over the bar (56th).
Before New, Guardiola defended a four-shot chain with David Alaba in the centre of Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after musculary problems, back in the Kader, sat outside.
The World Cup hero has only been given the green light after the final training, Sports Officer Matthias Sammer said: "Anyone who wants to make something else is bad."
Even during the first change, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it clear.
Before the match there was a tie in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially mixed Bavaria fans in their viewers apparently had provoked supporters of Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and went against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bavaria fan was transported out of the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth.
Those who smoke are damaging not only the lungs, but also the teeth - that is what a Potsdam long-term study suggests.
The good news: When it comes to giving up, the risk is falling quickly.
Smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early.
This emerges from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the Deutsche Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In comparison to non-smokers, smokers have the risk of losing their teeth prematurely.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The DIFE emphasizes the main causes of dental failure and inflammation of the gum.
For these periodontitis smoking is a risk factor and the authors emphasize the authors.
The connection between smoking and loss is therefore related to more frequent gum infections of smokers.
It is not possible to clarify the extent to which smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stopped smoking but could reduce their risk in a short time write the researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research."
However, it could take more than ten years before the risk could be repeated to the level of non-smokers.
People need to be convinced to be non-smokers, Heiner Boeing from DIfE: "Smoking shortens life" has been declared.
No smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, will also lead to good dental health up to high age.
In Germany, more than 20% of the population of 65 to 74 years has been affected by toothlessness.
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study will underpin the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains of late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine.
Archaeological discoveries have been made on the right bank of the Rhine on the right bank of the Rhine.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists have dug up the skeletons and remains of historical buildings, and the museum manager, Marcus Trier, said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called land monuments.
In all construction projects in Cologne, the Museum is always consulted as a specialist for the conservation of the Archaeological Park.
Archaeologists have now found their way to the third building section.
In the 4th century, a fortress and a church in the 8th century had been explained by Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with about 350 tombs that belonged to the church.
Young Woman of freight train
After a young woman is lost at the railway station in Geilenkirchen, the Federal Police are asking the people to help.
At the beginning of Wednesday morning, at 1.40, the woman from the direction of the railway station crossed the railway track at the end of the railway station and was captured by a freight train that came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
As a result of the capture of the train, it has suffered the most severe violations of it according to the federal police.
She was treated on the spot and taken to hospital by rescuers.
As a result of the nocturnal crossing of the young woman, there is no knowledge of the officials who are going to be appointed.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
In question come residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Notices that indicate the cause of the accident can be given under 24 hours and a free hotline of the Federal Police by telephone 0800/6888000 or by any other police station.
EU Commission proposes in dispute over TTIP new court
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system in order to defuse the planned transatlantic free trade agreement.
The disputed private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that is much more traditional in its operation.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said the competent EU Commissioner, Cecilia Malmström.
The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into free trade negotiations with the United States.
The German Government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
In concrete terms, the plans for reform of the current arbitration procedures indicate that the EU countries and the US are jointly selecting independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to come from the EU, the USA and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is planned for the first time.
It would make it possible to object to judgments.
Until now, the procedures involved have been agreed to arbitrators, and there was no possibility of an invasion of their judgments.
In the discussion of the past few months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system of fairness and justice.
In the long term, it wants to work towards an international investment court.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clarified.
The investor state arbitration proceedings (ISDS), mainly demanded by large corporations, are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major opposition in Europe against TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can take damages to the taxpayer at the expense of the taxpayer, negotiate national laws or impose a reduction of consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations, such as Campact, have described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate.
Above all, criticism has been made of the fact that they should not be applied to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
On the other hand, the German economic secretary, Matthias Machnig (SPD), described the plans as major progress.
The Commission has taken into account key points in the reform of the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French Government, too, welcomed the plans of Mrs Malmström.
The European company, BusinessEurope, has warned that too many new rules are being used to limit the economic situation of the economy.
It was particularly small and medium-sized enterprises that could be put at a disadvantage.
When talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be completed, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been in progress since the middle of 2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Originally, there should be a framework for the agreement at the end of this year.
This date is considered to be no longer valid.
Delicate Folk from Sufis Stevens in Hamburg.
Eleven years ago, Sufis Stevens sat on stage in the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
In addition to it there is a flipchart on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a pencil.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens.
He tells on the basis of various places that he repeatedly draws up on the map, reporting on songs that have been arranged in minute detail.
Where they were born and how they look in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative madman.
With the third album released in 2003 and the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," songs that have been cleverly composed are harmoniously close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the cool opulente at any time.
There are rumors that "Michigan" would be the first part of a twisted series: Each of the 50 US states should be raised in a row.
But already in 2004 and the Rhine area "Seven Swans" has already appeared and is breaking up in a positive way.
Stevens here is being reduced.
Live is enough for his guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), 2005 is a universally acclaimed masterpiece.
Building on ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album is rising in the American Billboard charts and is missing in any of the world's most influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens, then the Age of Adz (2010) uses very large pieces of electronic merchandise.
This sixth regular studio album is still orchestrated, but is worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects.
For a long time the smaller clubs have climbed up, the stage shows are going to be the colourful spectacle of Neon headband and a lot of fluorescent stage deko.
Currently Sufy Stevens is touring Germany as part of a group of five.
In the dark of Hamburg More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" that has been available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are now locked in their chairs, the Stevens, who have become much more mature, returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
The audience is listening: The talk is "opulent" and you can throw the "plate away fundamentally."
First of all, Stevens would like to thank him.
Jeremy Corbyns's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbett's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time is expected to be eagerly awaited.
The new Labour president Jeremy Corbyn is going to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six established questions, shortly after noon, with his performance probably being examined by the media and Labour MEPs.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns's leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the Tuc Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, Labour's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the celebration of the national anthem of a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is at the heart of several pages of headlines in the newspapers.
MR Corbyns's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
A spokesman of Mr Corbyn said that he had "in respectful silence" and he recognized "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air strikes around England."
But a member of Mr Corbyns's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight that he advised Labour leaders to sing the national anthem, "independently" from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns's top team, and they claim differences in economics, defense, and foreign policy, while less than one of the six of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences also stack within labour, following Mr Corbett's comments on the position on the European Union and the restriction of profits.
MR Corbyn told the Tuc conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow working and pension minister, said that the party was very clear that it was only opposed to the Government's plans to reduce the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour president, David Cameron, since he is Tory's chief, over the last decade of the Dispatch Box in Parliament.
The Labour leader, who has promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from "tacking" and arguing with opposition and has instead undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of Economic Affairs Minister, will represent him if he does not take part - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also discussed the idea of other Members taking the floor and raising the issue of John Bercow, the Speaker of the Lower House, in order to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Desire Theatre," which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister, as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow Members, although critics argued that it had become a caricature, needed far-reaching reforms.
Shot in Joburg: Homeless people trained to photographers.
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place to be left homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and to earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches young people how to take photos from their environment and gain a profit from them.
BBC News has taken one of the first graduates of the project.

The United Kingdom Growing up by accelerating Growth in Growth in the United Kingdom
In addition to this, the FTSE 100 was increased by the bid of SABMiller.
Between May and July, the result grew by 2.9% in the UK compared with the same period last year, without bonuses in the UK.
Since 2009, this percentage has been the quickest and possible assessment of the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound increased by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and was up to 0.84% compared to the euro at 1.3730 €.
The FTSE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.49% on 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the most prominent share on the market and made a 20% leap after the acquisition of the rival of AB.
A transaction would combine the two biggest breweries of the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competitor for luxury goods.
Richemonts's latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - re-announced growth.
Stocks of Glencore increased by 5% after Bergbauriese said that he had taken USD 2.5 billion by selling a stock as part of his strategy of debt reduction.
The stocks of the packaging and paper group, Mondi, were the biggest losers on the index, with a decline of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had put its assessment of the firm rating on "sell."
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sportswear company had reported a preliminary tax result of 46.6 million.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs of his company.
The cost could be the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: Bieber Expedition in Berlin.
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
It's 21 years old, a hanging object with a touch of upper hand.
The type with the platinblonden hair is EUR 100 million.
In fact more than that.
Currently Monsieur Bieber is bending in Berlin.
And the generation of U17 rotates.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name of "Ritz Carlton."
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
However, since 7 a.m. the Polin sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin luxury at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber building: Here lives her idol, whose poster hangs in stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly the same as her mom Ewa in half a year.
If so.
The saying is that "in fact my Viktors would have to sit in the tenth class in high school."
"I fulfil her a dream."
Should it be compulsory?
Who to juge?
The fans do not.
Also bending on itself.
That has already happened.
For the advertising in the advertising break of the super pack he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company washing many, many dollars on the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him, and above the counter, bending also takes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you look at the window pane.
It is supposed to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say that the hype is going too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally in the USA and Britain with its new single "What do you mean?"
Bending himself, whose fourth album is to be followed in November, the many zeros don't interest them anymore.
At least that is what he is doing.
Pegida brings Lebanese to the idea of potato döner.
Potatoes or Döner?
It's both - in the potato döner that the Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the phrase "potato instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potatoes and meat on a skate.
The idea brought him a poster of a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of Döner," which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then there has been a barbecue in his shop that is equipped with meat and potatoes.
"This is multikulti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea of the Lebanese has now been set up by the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Alhay does not want to betray the amount of meat and potatoes that it contains.
"It tastes even better together," he finds.
Culinary traditions of international understanding are also well received from its customers.
Metcash is launching a tilting campaign to combat Aldi-
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an aldi rally in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a tilting campaign to defend IGA's market share in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA-supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as events such as Adelaide.
IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Ice Manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and sells shop owners to sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler for food, alcohol, and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, because South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30% of Metcash's IGA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the eastern states.
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24% in Western Australia, compared to about 14% in the eastern states.
However, like Morgan Stanley, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will pick up about 5% of the food market in these two states and take away all existing actors, but mainly self-employed traders.
According to a report published this week, the Analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose 360 $in sales per year and $250 million a year by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and achieves a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and food and the quantities of metcashs of a high fixed cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA purchasers are the most.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in food and food will be reduced by 3.8% in 2016, by 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, reducing market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told us that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Douglass.
But it is assumed that a director of Metcash has been in contact with Mr Douglass last week.
IGAS's market share has fallen from 18% to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcashs's food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers since 2012, have fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting operating deleveraging and pressure on sales and margins.
The wholesaler, however, is investing more than $150 million to upgrade sales prices with Coles and Woolworths to hundreds of products each week and make IGA retailers improve their shops by improving their shops and providing a better choice of private label food.
Metcash's chief executive tells Ian Morrice that the price adjustments and shop rehabilitation programs are going to grow and hope that for the first time in 2017, the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Federation, Steve Healy.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise as a criticism of his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves praise as a criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the youngest of the talented Duos who is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came into the spotlight in the Montreal Masters by the notorious clash of Kyrgyzstan with Stan Wawrinka.
In a fiery qualifier in Cincinnati soon had to be separated by Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice by the referee, and Harrison exclaimed: "Wawrinka should have struck Kyrgyzstan, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen how he crushed a tennis racquet, after thwarting a potential US open victory by Richard Gasquet, Healy's Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in the competition with Sam Groth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"A thing that I am quite aware of is the fact that I think Thanasi has been caught in the quarrel," Healy said. Healy said.
He has broken a racquet when he lost because of a crane in the US Open, but he is not the first player to have broken a racquet with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think that he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a great team around them, he has a great family around them and I think he has been treated somewhat too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is being respected in the dressing area, he is working hard, he is well in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy who he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for all, but secures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term part of the team."
"First of all, we would like the team to be focused entirely on competition and not to focus on all the controversies around [Kyrgyzstan]," said Healy.
I think that Nick has made the climb very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he has made a lot of mistakes in the eyes of the public and has made a number of serious mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism that he receives.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back.
Hungary declared a state of emergency and advised the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held everyone who tried to get illegally into the country, aiming to stop the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the line when hundreds of migrants were gathered in a no-man's-land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
The people who had fled from violence were hiding for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations have increased.
When a police helicopter hounded over them, the migrants ran the border and hate insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some of them returned from protest of food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister declared that it was "unacceptable" for migrants to be returned from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serb border was not able to agree a common immigration policy one day after the 28 nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
The ministers, however, agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that, after all, next month or the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that EU countries would receive further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
On Tuesday, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not place its hopes on an early action from Brussels or from its neighbours.
Tuesday's emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, enabling them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country also planned to build a barbed wire along its border with Romania in order to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and the gateway to the European Union for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the incoming economic migrants are those who are in search of a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is very much in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the shameful of the 4-metre (13 feet) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia, to be a crime.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government explains the state of emergency," said Zoltan Kovacs's reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are saying it very clearly: Illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still approve the process of procedure and the military, who will be expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs as early as tagelang.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Adviser for Orban, said that authorities have invaded 45 people in trying to cross the border, while 15 others have already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come in by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and they are accused of committing crimes in accordance with the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a train car with barbed wire to close the borders had arrived.
Chaos gave rise to the most important border pass near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of human beings and put a crowd of people in order to infiltrate there.
About 20 managed to arrive, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in national surveys
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit margin in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground in the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47% of democratic voters in the pre-election (58 per cent), while Sanders is second, with 27% (an increase of 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency, receives support of 15% of the pre-election democratic voters.
More than five months before the beginning of the primaries, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear, which of the candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders scored some gains.
Clinton holds a great lead in women and moderates, but these advances have been reduced.
Their support for men has fallen sharply, and Sanders has only 5 points here.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has evaporated, and Sanders is now at the same level.
However, Clinton has a great lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was two of the liberals before Sanders, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in this group.
About half of the Democratic electorate of the Pre-elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if it were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15% would only support it because it is the candidate.
Six per cent of them would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, that Clinton's current supporters are enthusiastic about it.
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only a quarter would support them enthusiastically.
While 48% of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the view that it is time a woman (13%) is a woman (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
Approval of dealing with problems and eligibility are also cited.
As the vice-president throws a potential for the presidency, 57% of the pre-election voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do so.
When democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
From Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden would be her second choice well before Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to stand for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead will increase in front of Sanders, from 20 points with Biden to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five per cent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning; however, this figure has fallen by 78% last month.
Biden is by far the second in this measure, but the percentage that regards it as the most eligible has increased.
Nevertheless, on the question of what is more important for a candidate, the Democratic electorate call questions about voter eligibility.
As in the last month, not a single democracy candidate or potential candidate for these voters stands to be unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some of the important features of voters in their party's primaries.
Majorities regard Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, with strong leadership.
Biden performs best among the three candidates in the case of honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not agree with it.
Democratic voters, in general, also see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
For all of these measurements, about one quarter of the democratic electorate has no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked as Secretary of State during his tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with their statement on the matter and say that they have not influenced their opinions as a whole.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about one third is happy.
Public opinion was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on Clinton's general opinions, although 36% said that their opinion was getting worse.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton's views have become worse.
Although Clinton is regarded as honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this remains a problem for voters in total: Only 32% they see it as honest and trustworthy, eight per cent, less than last month, and 15 points since May.
62% of the electorate do not believe that they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of the electorate also see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump get good leadership, however.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are best cut from honesty.
A majority of Sanders regards Sanders as honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson gets close to Donald Trump at a national poll near Donald Trump.
Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump in the latest survey by CBS News / New York Times.
The two candidates now account for half of the voters" support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump across the country, with support growing from 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News last month to 27% in Tuesday's poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson was good with demographic groups and surpassed Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been cut off with Wisconlike's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen deep, with 10% support over the last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey, which was published last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls - ending up with 19% support for Republicans, behind Trump at 32%.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a view to a carson rising in the last week, Trump found some side strings for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's belief.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Even if top values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing in order to find even warm water.
A bath in the North or the Baltic Sea is likely to be a short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer enter the sea: A maximum of 18 degrees has water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, sharing the German Weather Service (DWD).
In contrast, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean.
In the Adriatic it is at 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a barman.
Almost two years after a student died during a bulky ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges were lodged against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College of College Pi of Psi attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory session in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, sharing the police.
Officials said that he had been burdened with a 30-pound bag full of sand and repeatedly attacked while he tried to reach target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to hospital.
However, they had time to change clothes, his symptoms of googs and Andy Meng to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide Utensilien and set out the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle over that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning at his injuries.
Following a autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with blunt power of injuries on the head, trunk and thighs.
"too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood, and at least one student has died every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Dengs family in a statement.
Fratrics and their members must be held to account, and this is a very important step by the authorities.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment of the third degree of murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassment and the formation of a criminal association.
"We don't just want to blame the persons involved, but if there is an organisation that has sanctioned this, officially or informally, this is what we will call them," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local group.
This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest rates will occur, and the house will falter, returns on bonds will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance on how to proceed.
A recession came within only 11 months of the first increase in interest rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why representatives of the US central bank have emphasized so sharply that investors should not focus on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period that is needed for normalization.
Indeed, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the excitement about an increase in interest rates may have been exaggerated.
"The first rise of the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, that does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here, a look at historical trends is how some parts of the economy could react:
As the market saw last month, anticipation of interest-rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that asset earnings from 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may be reflected again by the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happened after the Fed's interest-rate hikes.
To be more precise, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the uptrend - about 14% - on the way to the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days (average profit of 2.6%), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis that Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the recovery cycle and begins to reduce the rate of return.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often encourage rate hikes.
In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable that gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the Fed's interest-rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, only two nominal GDP was below 4.5% since 1950.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5% for the third quarter of the Atlanta Fed.
Interest-rate hikes in such a fragile economic landscape could be risky, let's raise the question of whether it is different this time, said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken an interest rate hike by the Fed all year round, and all eyes were addressed at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, futures trading is only likely to be 25%.
"In our study, all recovery cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super-cycle with an increasing momentum in GDP," said the report of the report, very quickly after the start of recovery.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and that is 74 months.
Fixed income was also volatile because the market anticipates interest rates and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in equities when they change their strategic course.
On bonds, returns seem to change direction as soon as the first rise in the cycle is achieved.
At the end of the recovery cycle, bond yields fall immediately, and Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will mean that returns between longer and shorter bonds will converge and break the curve.
High-yield bonds often yield better returns in such a climate, though "we are still careful to expect higher returns," Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the price of growth is flat, credit bubbles have expanded, and volatility has increased - all the features of the market have increased when the Fed intensifies its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US will benefit from increasing interest rates and making local products more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off, as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, and also financing their debt.
"History shows that quality "shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
On average, firms with a strong record exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the increases in interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high yields of capital and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low quality counterparts by average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will be a major problem.
Companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates will lose most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers may see profits through higher returns, even if experts disagree how quickly that will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham.
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station for being "dummed."
He argues that he is increasingly unable to distinguish between commercial rivals.
He also directed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she only imitated The Brits
Parliament's colleague, Damien Collins, attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "is transformed to Classic FM, claims a leading Member of Parliament and increases pressure on the station to prove that he is doing something that the private transmitter does not.
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station "stupid" and increasingly no more should be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I use the word "don't like it - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be The Brits only under a different name.
So if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you only imitate what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director-General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far in front of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I will never learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and place new works on order are really important to me," said he.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work must be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that, during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture, media and sport, was plunged into fire by the commercial rivals on their feet.
The Tory MEP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly prominent?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George - was produced on a special BBC way.
He added that he wanted the company "a hit out of our own stall" when it started a series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of other ranks of The Voice in the future or spend money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose on the slowest in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for it.
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping.
Experts believe that the Black Friday slowed down spending in November.
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been bent, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditures for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000, with only 5% in comparison with the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, this has always evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales began three years ago, when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But that is now a pendulum, and we may experience a reduction in growth.
The black Friday phenomenon that has been imported from America is quoted as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event, which will take place last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of buyers around their computers and the number of merchants plummeted.
Experts believe that black Friday, at which the buyers were fighting for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found out that out of 5 £expenditure, more than 1 £was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now done by web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims are buried in Mecca in the Kran accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned.
The bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the first rites in Mecca by the roads.
Saudi Arabia imposes part of the collapse of part of the huge Saudian Bin Laden Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were taken by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed on Mekka's Great Mojee.
Mourning filled, mostly dressed in white, the way to show their respect, when the first of the dead entered their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession passed over to the holy place, where only days before crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then at the end.
The corpses were released for the funeral, when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden farm because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Moschee Mekka were worn by the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane.
MR Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Haddling to Mecca with thousands of people who will continue to come to the city will continue.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin Laden Group should not have shut the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the Great Moschee, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the hive that is taking place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group did not publish statements about the collapse of cranes, and their representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also sent the group on account of current security measures and did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mekkas Großmoschee as part of the massive construction project that is led by the Bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990's.
The fall of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom, for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million people (£174,000) paid to the relatives of the displaced persons and permanently injured the same amount.
Others have been injured in half of that amount.
B & Q Boss says that the time of the cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over.
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury.
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased beyond itself.
This means that 200 other screwfix-shops aimed at craftsmen will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide.
From Rupert Steiner, City Chef correspondent of the Daily Mail.
It is claimed that Britons are putting down their pens and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes.
If you can skilfully use a hammer or a brush to remove walls, you now seem to belong to a minority.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out home office jobs in their homes, the head of the company is behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, a new CEO of Kingfisher who owns the building market, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has become obsolete.
That is why Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and 60 outlets of B & Q.
Mrs Laury said that she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the shop were taken by women.
At the moment, the men are dominated by men.
She said that it is necessary to face up to the growing demographic trends that show more female single-households who are making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "It is still a majority of men in our stores.
We need to shift this more closely towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers account for 80% of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of the leading companies listed by only five women at the head of a UK in the FTSE100 Index, has also designed its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in positions of responsibility.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50% of the team with women, including its Management Board and CFO.
Mrs Laury said: 'This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in the half-year profits and the sales after the group owed the cost of closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B & Q have 200 new branches opening up.
Officials of Aich / Dob due to infidelity in court
On Wednesday, at the regional court of Klagenfurt, two officials from the Austrian Volleyball Vice-President, Aich / Dob, will have to answer two of them.
They were not guilty of the accused.
One of them had also been accused of abuse.
He has been acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to the Attorney General Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it became clear that the accused used money for private purposes in 2006 until 2011, which they were allowed to provide for private purposes by 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial offences.
This fact left the chair of the office, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later stage.
For the sake of fidelity, the defense was that the Association was not formed at any time.
The sports officials would only have to charge expenses and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and they had invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the passiva in 2001 around 600,000 shilling (approximately 44.000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: We are continuing to keep the club out, or we are closing down," said one of the accused, who was on the breaded of the financial bureau in the field of bread.
He decided to take over this task with his colleague and fellow member.
With all the risks.
"We have used money to make our life insurance a safety at the bank," said he.
The Association has been agreed with: You can manage the money freely, you cannot make any debt.
Furthermore, in the event of any financial success, the disbursement of allowances had been decided retrospectively until 1991.
That is why some of the expenses have only been paid out years later, from 2003, as a plus in the account.
That is why it seemed that there was a package of packages, not detailed reservations, explaining what was going on.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why payments were not disclosed to the club in detail, the judge asked.
The association has not been interested in the detail for financial management, it was important only to have the freedom of debt, so the answer.
In 2011, a sum of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association's account.
These were reserves, the defendants said.
This securities account ran on the name of the second and was not known by the association.
"Why?," the judge wanted to know.
The respondents did not know about this for a long time.
Then he said that he thought that this was the best for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money.
The co-accused had been informed, the official was able to do so.
This transfer has been formulated as "Damage Recovery."
Why damage was done, judge and public prosecutor wanted to know.
The first declared that he was not in agreement with this formulation because the club had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says: "With that, you are all from the Schneider."
"I am a legal representative," he asked.
In addition, the official said that he had never received a cent salary, which he only used to charge kilometres and coins.
He had to charge the club for €1,000 per month, but the real effort was much higher and he added.
Accurate records for the early years were unable to present the accused.
They were no longer kept after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly, they said.
The second defendant had also referred to the second defendant.
All of the houses can be found in cash, and he has stated in his statement that he has to drive from his home town of international market to the bank in Bleiburg.
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard has produced another 30,000 jobs.
In addition to the workforce reduction that has been in operation for three years, the computer giant will remove further jobs when the company is split up.
The hiring of Hewlett-Packard (HP) has no end.
Within the framework of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to dismantle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client.
This would reduce costs of EUR 2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion), as the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The 55,000 jobs that have been in operation for three years have not yet been completed.
At the end of fiscal 2007/14, HP still had a workforce of around 302,000.
On the other hand, the Hewlett Packard shares had 2.3 percent.
California's Palo Alto, which has become a major producer of printers, is currently evolving in a new company in a new society - separately from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both businesses are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A more disappointing PC sales paragraph and a weaker demand from corporate clients for services placed the second largest PC manufacturer in the world at the end of Lenovo.
In the third quarter, at the end of July, sales of PC and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.4 billion dollars.
The revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job losses to changes in the industry.
The 76 year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has late responded to the fact that customers are buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more things to do business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans see a total reduction of some 55,000 posts.
Conflict: Majority support for the anti-IS training mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in hostilities in Iraq would, however, be largely opposed to rejection: 54% were opposed, and 35% were in agreement.
The fact that other states are flying aerial attacks on Iraq and Syria is 61 per cent.
24 per cent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A collaboration with the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, rejects 51% of respondents, 20 per cent.
29% were unable to decide.
Car: Second day of the day at the 66th IAA.
The focus of the exhibition will be on networked, self-driving cars and electromobility until 27 September.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show on Thursday under the motto "Mobility."
The wide public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the Auto Association are expecting around 900 000 visitors, as they were two years ago.
Röszke: Violent eruption on the Serbian border
The Hungarian police have applied to the Serbian border with Röszke Tränengas and water cannons against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind this, a police line had been formed and behind the police there was a water cannon.
40 to 50 refugees started to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles after the official.
The officials initially used pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was used in the direction of the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn something that is lagging behind.
A pregnant woman and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees slept in themselves and suffered from breathing.
The press spokesmen of the Serbian police have also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
The time for the decision on interest rates for the Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to take the important decision of whether or not interest rates are raised for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey among 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half, which last week thought that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level from 0 to 0.25 per cent.
It is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Fed put interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, director of staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global relations.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the odds against such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday
Death Protectors at Delta State University left letters of apology.
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before, before being killed by his colleagues later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "tired" at the first murder and he wanted "he could do it," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi said that lamb, lecturer for Geography and Social Science Education at the Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10: 00 on Monday morning.
And said he had shot on someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police had to send policemen to his home.
He said, "I was able to kill my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but that nobody will disturb it, but that it will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
As a police the scene entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, which said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb rode 300 miles to the Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when he was surrounded by police.
University President William LaForge said that he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss was written by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years as a "good man."
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he had a daughter who was 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said that Prentiss were their daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online at home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had met lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police said that lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them that "he will not go to prison."
When police took him on Hwy 1 near Greenville later in this night, lamb drove his car to the side, fled to the forest, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, Lamb received a PhD from the Delta State University, as indicated by his life on the University's website.
Stars who Lost their Happiness
The actor (left), in the image with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia and in 2009 lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor also claims to fight with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drugs.
All of this is going to take its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa builds the Group.
Lufthansa plans a large group of companies.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization.
150 of the world's around 1000 executives will cost the jobs of the Group.
There are, however, new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and is valuing the cheap of Eurowings.
The goal of the realignment was to generate a earnings contribution of around €500 million per year out of cost and energy synergies, as the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will cease to be a board of directors for passenger business.
The low-cost airline in Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt for Eurowings will be responsible for the management team at Carsten Spohr.
With the change, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, which the Group intends to take up against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of 120 000 employees has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Airline Group, which represents three quarters of annual sales of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective dispute with the pilot Association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed after the trial of the court on Thursday.
That was what the trade union said.
The issue of the talks is intended to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wanted "in a year with a projected record result" as soon as possible to produce good results as soon as possible.
The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transition of the pilots, the background is the austerity concept "Wings."
It appears that in the fight against competitors, Lufthansa is outsourced to the Group's own low-cost budget line.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months because of duplicate fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought wine to the left and was excluded from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not believe that Shaw can play again in this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after the 20-year-old Shaw had collapsed in the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg and is in hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and will then operate in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, the six months will last and it will not be in the group phase.
I hope that he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexicans.
Van Gaal assumed that the Italian judge was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack on both feet.
A tweet on Shaws was: "I thank you all for your messages: Words cannot describe how I am, my way to recovery begins now, I come back again."
Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat of PSV.
With the European Cup in France, the England defender has an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It is a very bad injury."
If a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, all of them are very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland during the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy, and if you hear that it is a very bad injury, that is not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction, so it looked like he had touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In the interview with SBS6 said Moreno: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult that can be.
I feel very bad and I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to hospital - after a Foulgame by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron certainly knows The Lorax better?
It is a matter that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost by heart.
It is that you are perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite child book, the Prime Minister decided for The Lorax, which was published in 1971 by Dr Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative, with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give an image or a message that we have missed so far."
Everything is fine, except that the subsequent paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book, instead reflects a summary of the film version of 2012 that added new characters and details in order to extend the fairly short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thmake-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by saying that he wants to see a real tree," he says.
As if that were not suspect enough, the text submitted by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the film presented by the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and begins: "in the walled city of Thneed city, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, Cameron seems unlikely to be so familiar with the book's plot.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokesperson said that the text had probably come from Cameron's electoral office.
SuperCamps confirmed that Cameron's text was delivered, but did not make any other immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England's team, but it is still difficult.
Reaching Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the cadres that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series is not on my card.
I would not rule out a victory for the future.
Alastair Cooks may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting setting, and the Community spirit is strong; they will not bear scars of 2012, but they will only be a romantically positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin-off and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown size on the test level, an option for the attack.
That's the reason for this: Adam Lyth leaves from the England test cadres and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out, of course, for me, as his chief coach in Yorkshire, is difficult to analyze.
With its seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are targeted at results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - as I said earlier - players are their best selection.
A long time ago, Lyth would have been extended, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he is going to go further for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not do so well, and that does not surprise me; he is mainly a team man.
The question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult.
Lyth got seven odds - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play back and forth.
The only accusation that could be made was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a drummer whom I value highly.
He is an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early in the season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge Square, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as those received before him, but this depends, of course, on the line-up of teams in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of beating Moeen in addition to Cook, providing an extra Spin Bowler and getting four quicks appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a drummer cannot beat there, and this left-handed has already shown that he is a vicious circle of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county of Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no big difference.
My former team mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an Opentor in 2001.
He has three hundred Runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the Kader as a back-up-spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he has impressed me as a young man.
People may see their statistics - on average 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and think it is a punt, but there are no large number of backup spiders who rise their hands and the trainers have chosen for young people.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England has made some clever additions to the trainee.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman of Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.
I always felt that he was created for international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can profit from.
Sometimes new voices can take place in the changing room, even if the messages are in line with what was said before.
Collys's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used by the One-Dayers, root received a similar break against Australia and I, for my part, have no problem with it.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and Teamsters do not determine the timetable.
And you must remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit from the EU) could win if the economy gets into a Flaute by 2017.
David Cameron's unorthodox renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is bound to run deeper with each passing day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European student of diplomacy recently said that some member states, so deeply involved in various crises, such as the EU, are now and are not always fed up with the UK's own fault, Britain's self-generated agenda with divided concessions, and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly do not want.
In Brighton, the Tuc decided at their annual meeting that they don't like it if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbing at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, a photograph of itself in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, come home and say that they win allies for reform.
It is always about me.
My European friend, who wishes to see Britain in the interior of the EU tent, says Berlin - and we can see that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in certain capitals have come to the point where it does not matter whether we are going to stay or go.
Germany's cautious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as she did in the excessively long of Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks to his re-election or its replacement in 2017.
It is also a force that has been blocked.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left.
It is hard to imagine that they will take up a leg to help the Selfie Britons, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something that they don't want, because most similar separatist tendencies have the most.
That is why some of these ministers are actually planning deliberately unhelpful comments, in the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process is suspected by my friend.
"The renegotiation was a default" and "Britain has won nothing of the value of the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their cost, and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press, as they did during Tony Benn's inspired referendum in 1975 with a ratio of 2: 1.
They can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the Erz Euro-opportunists, who made a name for themselves as a "EU-Gerade banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.
In all its rigidity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This was one of the things that belonged to the medley of rogue villains, foreigners who are using telephone, and the pseudo-non-residents who own most of our great newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about it, but found that if you were sitting with a hot gorilla in a cage, you would be distributed better for bananas in order to distract him, rather than for lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself, when he resisted Cameron's referendum, because Blair had imposed the principle of the EU's unenacted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened up a back door in 2005.
The press has never lost it.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who on Monday gave me a kind of kindness on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer need time to waste me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott of Morsi's strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns's official position in Europe is - I'm going to express it in a friendly way.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukips can say yes.
It is what Hilary "Ein Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on the radio and television said this week when the Scouting fought in him not to admit that Corbyns's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father on television tried to be illoyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But to fight in order to remain "under all circumstances" - Benns's expression was not what McDonnell said, nor was it what JC told his supporters and MEPs after all the reports at their meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever he wants to convey to Corbyn's bottom-up image - remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and, above all, in the Strudel of the Social Media, a breeding ground for paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Labour in the referendum campaign as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns's basic ambiguity about EU membership - in line with its anti-capitalist past, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that JC will not launch a campaign to leave - will foreign diplomats be obliged to try to find a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, as they have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaningless?
The US is already rather disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction of the Tory government in power, as I was reminded at the start of Monday, which was called the British influenza Security Forum.
Experts criticise the report by Public Health England about e-cigarettes.
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in her report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Policy Report" of last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
One editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month addressed the "extremely windy foundation" on which PHE established its most important conclusion.
Two further researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims are "based on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
You said that the public expects that the claim of PHE that "the current best estimate is that E-cigarettes are about 95% less than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) in order to produce their opinions on the damage from various products containing nicotine; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managers were supposed to have received an independent study from British American Tobacco.
He also signed the TAOs on Public Health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said that they had to receive money from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but they did not add the funding he would have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International in advance.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the Board are not supplied, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also specify some of the industry financing on paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco management of PHE also participated in the session.
The work done by the group, it is significant, is that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria."
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell have said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence that E-cigarettes are a way of smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at PHE, said that the BMJ had already responded in advance.
He said: "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies in his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease with regard to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion per year.
By clearly presenting evidence that E-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking is our national competence.
BBC should give up Eastenders, says former boss of Channel 4.
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like Eastenders and The Voice.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK stations.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in fiercely contested time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that for six years Channel 4 had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are being commissioned or are being sent, which would also clearly be shown by non-subsidised rivals," said Johnson, the Oberhaus communications committee in his investigation on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term, one should at least give production to programmes that others do not do or order.
They send The Voice in a premium time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax is financed by programs that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, Eastenders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their rights.
I am trying to see how this is to be public service television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the pursuit of ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular broadcasts on the BBC reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, proposed in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to sell BBC shows like Eastenders.
Johnson said that the more publicly-legal niches were supposed to go to BBC4, where one cannot measure the audience, but they do fulfil their tasks, and they can argue that if they go on their hypocritical missions for the justification of £4 billion, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They lay them in a window where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the radio fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I call on you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions that can receive the best value.
Of course all of them think all, we all think that you get a lot of money for £150 per year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £, I wonder if that is true because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky- and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also said in front of the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission, "to inform, educate and entertain."
He said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that 1% of its TV production and 0.1% of the radio were on the radio - and it should take an example to public service television stations in Australia and Canada.
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown, with the commercial channels of alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves.
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction in the moment when they are being heard with sound impulses that have been heard for the human hearing at high frequencies in order to be heard.
The impulses work by activating Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on this subject: Researchers reading and writing brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the depths of brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of humans to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fadenworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplifying the ultrasound waves that then penetrate the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves work on structures that are called TRP-4 ion channels and in the membranes of some of the worms.
The sound waves result in the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned.
In order to create Ultry-controlled Nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Motoneurons wear TRP-4 ion channels.
If he uses ultrasound on the modified creatures, the sound waves of the Mikrobbers will be amplified and transferred into the worms where they turn on the modified Motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light that has to be sent down to the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic shafts can pass unhindered and can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Misleading Britain's Arms Trade
Check out Amnesty International's anti-weapons exhibition video.
Terrible killer drones!
The ankle joint is one of the most popular sports in the world.
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock absorbers that cause pain of pain, but leave no trace!
The happy voice and the cartoon images make it clear that this display for the world's largest arms trade fair is a combative parody that has been produced by Amnesty International in order to put the spotlight on the willingness of the British Government to get weapons to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree in the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are at bus stops and in the metro trains and require a second look.
"Important notice: Take the DLR (Docklands Light Railway) from the 15th to 18th of September and read it in the documents of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which is transformed into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of dealers with DLR will take place... customers are asked to help at the end of the arms fair.
The 300 posters are exhibited by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective with the name Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a 6£ Pack of Inbuskey, which claims that "Access to around one third of the bus" advertising space is on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't make fun of this placid "vandalism."
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists engage with activists in protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world, so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters is the commuters in the metro.
The Amnesty International has been viewed over 24 hours on Facebook for over 100,000 times and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, which works with the graphic and voiceover artist, who is also working for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever was astonished by the silence that prevailed around the publicity for the arms trade fair - through a space of the ExCeL calendar - thinking, "We give them the campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic, more realistic corporate advertising, but "by the introduction of bright colors and animation it remains stronger."
"You have made a fantastic job by helping us sharpen awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies from Amnesty.
What we need now is intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area inside ExCeL, where exhibitors are making fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab is revealing an order of the US army over "the AT4CS RS fired from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped combat head, which delivers outstanding after-effects inside the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Homes
Eleven years ago I moved into a student residence as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, still in faith in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I hated - and the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I have learnt can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student residences ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to laugh: People tell where you come from, whether and where you have taken Sabbatyear where you are standing in relation to Corbyn, and why you don't love to love it.
Breathe in.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were fire extinguishers.
Leave people.
The rooms of people are often transformed into beverage receptions, film night events and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people are dressed up and wearing their underwear.
In this case, don't remember to start at the university with a relationship.
Introverted get a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many of the student residences are a space for boule culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say: "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can get the energy that I used for interaction with you."
Try to feel when a commun of conviviality is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of a message.
Knock: Do it.
A guy in my student residences had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship closes through baking.
Since you are starting the university at the peak of the back-mania, the clapping of the doors of people to imagine a plate full of brownies is less strange than welcoming the 1950" s.
Homemade treats are a good way to make friends.
They feel obliged to speak and will eventually associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed clumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course the claws of chicken is a theft, but is it the take of a drop of Milk for your tea also?
Check with the owner of the milk.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook in the interior.
If someone steals your belongings, that is annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to be more balanced than my fellow who added their milk to a swill to punish thieves.
It is now in prison.
You should not make noise that discourages people from sleep or work.
It is not only a matter of being a decent person, but that you literally belong to the people who are sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hall asked her neighbors if it is something that makes them a bit quieter, because it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
She responded with even better music.
When they stopped at 5 o'clock, they kindly allowed their neighbors to sleep two hours before they put their own music in place, closed their door and went to their three-hour test.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse were to join the same student residence at random?
Conversely, it would not be deeply embarrassing if you were to hold a co-worker for your future spouse, go to them, separate themselves and then see them see each day and perhaps witness how all of the common friends are swamped with each other?
Of course, the heart goes through its own paths - but if a hot female is definitely not your future spouse, at least you try to get some sense of common sense.
In the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between Ulk and Mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good trick is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Give yourself a valuable and amusing lesson about security, but don't miss somebody's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and place your keys in a glass of water that you then put into the freezer.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur, Markus Gildner, is building in the Franconian corner valley for people who do not have a lot of money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "It is not only refugees who need a living space, but also the single mother and the low earners alike."
"I show how to build even better today," says the 44-year-old in the interview.
Thousands of refugees are being pushed into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes that housing can be created quickly: It builds in a project for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees are being pushed into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass of accommodation in containers or gymnasiums has no sustainability.
Because people remain to a large extent here.
In view of the flow of refugees, there is also enough room for housing in the coming decades.
A completely banal 3-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
It makes integration easier.
This is different when people are taught in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three accommodation units for four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a common room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it is peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can be easily adapted to their needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square meters per house amounts to 184 000 Euros, without plot.
That is manageable.
The construction took six months.
That is appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have completed my project correctly.
What makes it particularly complicated is the threat of Damocles and the regulation on space.
It is green.
It is still being suggested that those who create three homes in a terraced house need at least three places.
It is only in cities that lack the space to do so.
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
That is definitely not true.
Do you not exacerbate the competitive battle for affordable housing?
Gildner: The truth is: We had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years, but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, even ordinary people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earners alone.
I show you how to build even better today.
That is what this is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and first focused on environmental analysis.
Ios 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released.
The new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app, typing in "General" and then selecting "Software Update."
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation because they get an error message that says that the software update failed.
In order to avoid the problem, users are advised to wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process.
This may mean removing apps to create space - but Apple has made it less likely by streamlining the update, and it will also be easier to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall apps when the process is completed.
It is worth it to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or that it is close to a charger so that the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down halfway and lead to a breakdown of the update.

Rosberg's only motto: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton only a motto: "Full Attack."
The World Cup Second stressed before starting in the crucial seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose."
There are 53 points that can be separated from the world's premier before going to Singapore on this Sunday of the title defending champion and second champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the twelve races of the season and is also the favorite of the floodlights in the city.
2009 and last year, the 30 year-old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will have an impact on Singapore's Great Prize is still unclear.
For days there is a mist over the city, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger has a prominent member.
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen," which was founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, so the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who has spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the German Federal Medal of Merit and Honorary Citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that took place at the head of Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee.
Youth work and talent research are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the Chess Club and friendly contact with the Tennis Club "Rot-Weiß" will be seen as an expression of his commitment to the spa town.
The office of the hotel is looking for direct contact.
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined forces under the cover of the social foundation and have opened a new contact point at Graf Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to consultations you can also take part in courses.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city centre.
More precisely the place of Count Stauffenberg.
A new service office was opened there recently.
Here, in the immediate vicinity of the purchasing market, senior citizens and information on questions such as care insurance are provided for information on health care and care.
For years now, we have established with our outpatient care service that family carers are often left alone.
There are endless questions about this.
"It is not uncommon for many of the benefits of the funds to be taken into account because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new owner, Jutta Weigand.
In addition to the consultations, the new accommodation office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this the Saludis was taken on board.
That is why you can use additional offers such as falling prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers of the senior center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The senior center for care and care," depicts Heike Riedel, managing director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new service in the city centre is particularly in demographic change.
This makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg vital in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) pointed out at the inauguration ceremony, the service of the accommodation office was also dedicated to the club's age. "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite you to a regular social get-together."
This means that the social foundation makes a great contribution that seniors can live as independently as possible in their familiar surroundings.
The accommodation office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 6 pm and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October.
Now it is official: After renovation work at Fuchsparkstadion of the date for the match of FC Eintracht Bamberg had not yet been laid down for the third party of Würzburger Kickers, now has been set as the date of 6 October.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth round of the Bavarian football Totopokals was finally terminated now.
Played on Tuesday, 6 October at 19: 00 in the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going on the stage, now we have the security of planning," so FCE Team Manager Karlheinz Hümmer also points out the pre-sale that has now been started.
It is special for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore hope for a lot of spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlights have a special charm.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg moved through victories at the regional headquarters of 1 FC Oberhaid (3: 1) (3: 1) and at home against the regional ligists 1 FC Schweinfurt 05 (3: 2).
The winner of the contest will receive 5000 euros and will qualify for the first round of the DFB Club in 203/2017.
Defending champion is a third party rider SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang had an age of 92.
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of the Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses an honorary member and, at the same time, "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna."
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but was also working as a teacher, writer and director of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and remodeled the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Police accuse the police of making money with money
Former footballer Tim Wiese was struck in Bremen.
Footballer was once, meanwhile is Tim Wiese, ex national goalkeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
According to his own statement in the past two years, he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass.
Intellectually, he failed to do so.
In the inner city of Bremen it was possible to cut the hair when he saw how out a parking guard guard had laid out a penalty for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Meadow stormed out of business, insulted the official and threw her the due fine in front of the feet, as the "picture" newspaper reported.
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but it is not yet clear about the consequences of the unusual incident.
"The thing is still in the examination," says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be determined whether or not to display a field.

Men on 17 Years of Afghanistan
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 11.45 p.m, three young men were at the foot of Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster.
One from the group, a 17-year-old from Afghanistan, followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five metres and called to them that they were waiting for him.
At that time the group was at the height of the bft petrol station.
There were also three people on the petrol station.
One of these men cried out to the young and beat him in his face.
The victim suffered a leg of nose here and heavily bleed out of his nose.
When his two friends rushed and appeased the racquet, he first dropped from his victim.
From his friends, the last young man has now been taken home.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a passenger car until the end of the apartment and demonstratively ended several times.
When the vehicle was no longer looked at, the injured person went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the racquet and another male person.
Under the help of a stroke it was sprayed on the face and the thighs of the victim.
The injured had to be taken to hospital for medical treatment.
Up to now, only a vague description has been given.
One of the men was about 1.80 metres tall.
The second racquet was supposed to have been around 1.65 meters and was dressed with a jeans and a brown white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and signers to contact us at 06181/100-123.

This is also a pleasure for Bernd Bormann's master of business, Economical Development of Uta Seim-Schwartz and the Mayor of Asendorfs Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf is lucky: On 1 October Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice.
While Ursel Felöhausen retires in retirement, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, is still in the next couple of months with half a page.
After a period of reconstruction, Müller opened the practice on 12 October, and until then he invested 310,000 Euros in the premises at the St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was a favourite of Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
"We had always in mind that the garbage would fit well into this practice," said Dr. Ursel Felöhausen and laughs.
"When it was so far, I just called them."
Müller liked the idea of conducting his own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The closeness and the constant contact with patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
He also believes that he will soon be his own boss.
And that is how one was agreed that the garbage was bought by the house in practice.
However, they will continue to live in quarry Vilsen.
Frank Müller, who grew up in Germany, grew up in Hanover in several periods of medical practice and also in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nuriburg and Rotenburg.
At present he has been working as a doctor in Sulingen and has been appointed as a senior physician in the county of Diepholz in 2009.
From 19 September, the practice for the new boss will be prepared.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felöhausen works as a family doctor, his wife, Ursel, has specialized in gastroenterology.
The garbage, both internists, want to settle as family doctors.
"Endoscopy comes out of it," says the 38 year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and endurance EKGS.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
The sum of a total sum of EUR 50000 will be given by the garbage in the context of a programme of support for the District (25000 Euro) and of the Sami Community (12500 Euros) and the municipality (12500 Euros).
"This shows how proud and glad we are that the practice will continue," stresses Bernd Bormann, a public service officer.
For about 2000 patients, according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, each quarter comes into a field of field breaks, and in the North German average practice it is about 500.
In Asendorf there is also a doctor's surgery.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller's practice: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf according to Ursel.
If no successor had found itself, it would have gone.
Anyone who visits Müller's point of speech will continue to look in familiar faces.
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, and the medical profession has been practised there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we had only two rooms," recalls Ursel Felöhausen.
A little gloom already felt after the long time.
"We still live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often," says the internist.
Her husband added: "We have a 6000 square meter plot."
"So far I have always pressed for gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and is happy to travel.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also being driven at our southern border," said Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner, Minister of the Interior.
Controls at the Hungarian border continue to be maintained in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wishes to apply for asylum can do so.
The supply and security of the people are in the foreground.
"It is also clear that it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migratory flows, including the Austro-Hungarian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering 'Corridor' - Slovenia
The Croatian Government had previously said that Slovenia, too, wanted to leave refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and could also establish corridors for the refugees.
However, the interior minister, Vesna Györkös Znidar, did not see it in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Slovenia is going to intensify the surveillance of the border, especially in Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenia's borders do not want to be closed down for refugees.
"Every member of the EU has to fill in its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian Government has said, the first refugees had already tried to enter the night of Tuesday in eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik /Sid border to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to take up this in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have constantly been meeting in Croatian Tovarnik.
These are predominantly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use.
In the coming days, his country will be counting on about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian Serb border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, which included Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was, the people were saying that there were certain routes to follow: "neither we nor we want to do so," it was said.
According to the media reports, at least in the morning, a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, that more buses would be expected in the course of the day.
Concerning Croatia, Slovenia and Austria in Germany
The inmates were travelling through Serbia all night of the Macedonian border, which was about 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has done, so the police told us that we should go here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
In this way, it may now be possible for observers to postpone the previous Balkan route to Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Serbia that has already been postponed to a slightly wider west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive Border Control" (Borders)"
Croatia's Interior Minister, Ostojic, had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had comprehensive options for border control.
Strict checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, and EU partners have, since then, been a good testimony to the country in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they had spent the last night at the Horgos crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, both Horgos and Backi Breg continue to be closed completely.
It is still unclear whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border.
Serbia's Interior Minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic, tried to reassure Wednesday morning in a local eye in Horgos: He considered the debates on alternative routes for refugees to be premature after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be very high numbers of refugees at present.
One cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Aid to migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already started to distribute maps on which there are alternative routes through Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: In parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine-clearing houses was sent to the border region.
Stock-hackers: Ukrainians are paying $30 million
Supranonok is alleged to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals, being accused of gaining insight into still unpublished financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
Insider trading in the financial markets is supposed to have been made with the information that has been exploited.
In this way, according to the investigators, there were a total of over $100 million.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders will be caught in the end," says the SEC communication.
The trials against 32 other suspects were carried out in the case.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ökumenische Hospizhilfe Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years.
Around the place of Mannheim there is a lot of activity.
People do their worries, some take quick steps, some are comfortable.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalon at Paradeplatz.
Keep track of the city.
Pulsating, all life with a beautiful autumn sunrise and round in the middle of four large panels with the headline "Before I want to be...."
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20 years of existence and is certainly faced with mixed reactions.
"It is about life, therefore we have gone through the action in the middle of the city and people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is also at the disposal of passers-by for questions and discussions such as the volunteers.
While some people spontaneously stand up to the chalk and continue to "read" the sentence "in response to my life," "read with the camper through the USA," "stop the war" or "don't have to wait for long," keep others short, read phrases like "so far I'm not yet" and go on.
Time and again, small discussions about the action in itself, about life, are developing in terms of death.
Peter Hübinger is also on the spot.
"When I make it clear that at some point the end of this world comes to the end of the world, I can live responsibly," says the director of the diakonic work of Mannheim, which is together with the Caritasverband carrier of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
That is why this public action on the 20-year-olds is good.
It is understandable that not everyone on the panels would like to say that this is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death remains with taboos, such as the experience of Josefine Lammer, even though the Hospice movement in recent years has done much to open up people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The funeral and funeral assistant is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Through personal experience, they read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.
When the Ökumenische Hospizhilfe was looking for honorary members, she reported immediately and was involved in the foundation of 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 honorary volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected person and relatives in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences that have been made.
"I see life from another, it is precious and precious the moment," she says.
The offer of an outpatient ecumenical service is free and non-denominational.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of members of the family enables the training as well as the continuing education and supervision of the crew of the family.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The panels described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Protestant church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
It is also possible to record further personal wishes on postcards.
Mixed FedEx mixed, financial prospects for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for a year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to take about 55.000 seasonal workers on holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company would want to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The share fell more than 2.5% in Premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening of Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said that profit from $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year, which will end in May, will be 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected, according to a survey of FactSet 10,84.
Despite the price increases, which are an average of 4.9% and are effective on 4 January, the lower outlook will be effective on 4 January, and despite higher premiums for ground transport of heavy and large packages that are going to be made from November onwards.
The company said that it would nevertheless expect that the result would be increased compared with the previous year, owing to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns if one considers weaker than the expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later when the rival UPS, who plans to suspend 90.000 to 95,000 additional workers, such as the same number as last year, intends to do so.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned 692 million $, 6% more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the 2.44 $per share, which was predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts from Zacks expected to expect $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has recorded a decline in international priority shipping, which brought sales in its unit express dispatch to the Stagning.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales of ground transport increased by 29%, but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased because of higher labor costs in freight.
In Premarket Trading, about one hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by 3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed a 11% loss for the year and 17% below a record high on 11 June.
On their most anticipated meeting in the years, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting round a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise the policy rate for the first time in almost a decade.
There is a wall image of the United States that threatens to end at the end of the mixed session.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues want to put the economic interests of the nation before all else.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximization of US employment and prices.
But, since the Great Recession, the Fed has recognized leaders that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict.
Although most of the economy's data shows that it is growing firmly, the recent turbulence on global financial markets may make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to increase volatility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds, even if it is just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they are watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economics at the Maklermaker Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Kg.
"But I think that if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed is going to do.
About half of the economists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to withdraw, with a key indicator that displays only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless it recovers the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average was by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintains the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise the rates at this time," he said.
If she does, she would have to go very far in her statement to reassure the financial markets so that they do not panic.
Other experts argued that an interest-rate hike would reassure financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed in good ways to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen in the spring and early summer said that this year, despite the liberals' complaints, that more economic progress would be needed, it would expect an increase in the rate.
Although the creation of jobs in August slowed, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed views as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And, while inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherard, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets joined the world at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May, below its peak, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now being almost 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives, the market turmoil affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of China's economy would not have occurred in the last few weeks, they would be rolling in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve.
Now he is saying that it will wait at least one month to get the impact better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so it should not be involved technically in its decision-making.
But, in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere reference to the Fed in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with economic fundamentals."
Paint, voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is committed to an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points into three sessions, despite its limited impact on US growth.
A year later, the Fed reversed these cuts.
The Fed should place aspects of financial stability first during a severe crisis such as the collapse of the market in 2008, said Adam S. Poznań, former member of the Committee on the Settlement of the Bank of England.
The recent turbulence does not come near this level, he said.
"They certainly do not want to get into the situation where they are afraid of an interest-rate hike, because markets are getting upset," said Poznań, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and I do not believe that it should be preceded by time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Lax-C is often referred to as Thai costal and is a Thai wholesaler that is also sold to the public.
Yes, it is in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and tableware, furniture, religious jewellery and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department when you need engine oil.
The store is huge and it takes about an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shopping cart makes you hungry, there is a meal in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is close to the cash desks and has a variety of accommodation options.
What there is here is: Do you need something - something - Thai?
Lax-C is likely to do so.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the bar will clean the fish and even fry it for you.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and all of Galle, pork made natural darts, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and cooks, including individual families and individuals.
The wide gears are suitable for shopping cars and forklift trucks.
You will find here: Fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash desk.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and the city centre - a couple of blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: Lax-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even though the shop is well attended, it is not difficult to find a parking place.
Hoyerswerda: Small Aid for Refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
A warm welcome to you cannot be done without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support altruistic asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with their 74 Lenzen they are still happy to teach them.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker at the Dillinger Straße.
It helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is a very different lesson from a real school.
Brazil's paediatric society, Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding.
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS tries to inform women how important good nutrition is during breastfeeding, with the presentation of pictures of babies who suck in breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day.
But new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study, headed by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can have a negative effect on the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal council at Bernried approved the contract for the EUR 2.3 million.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flat for solar installation.
The plans for the long awaited turnaround building at the Bernrieder Sports area are taking step forward: In the most recent council meeting, the work worked out without much discussion was unanimously approved.
Prior to that, among other things, the body had decided on a proposal for a 'exemption' from the valid development plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form of roof construction.
Therefore a "saddle roof is supposed to be built with non-attached First and Roof."
In the context of planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This gives us a wonderfully large southern roof," Mayor Josef Steigenberger said at the meeting.
The "liberation" was in turn about the propensity that should be below ten degrees for energy reasons - in contrast to the building plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was needed because the plan of development in relation to the roof does not allow for an "exception" - where the Bernrieder Municipal Council as a rule tends to be more restrictive when it comes to applications for liberation.
However, this is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," so Steigenberger.
The whole building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
Around EUR 2.3 million are calculated at the expense of costs.
Grants for grants are expected to be provided by the promotion of school and grassroots sports.
In the next step, the construction application for the 18 x 36 m large hall will now be submitted to the Landratet for examination.
After Schongau the clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau.
The hospital Peißenberg is to be closed sooner than planned - in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will be a new medical director at the Hospital Schongau.
The station and the majority of employees are moving from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is reflected in the surprising plans of the hospital in the region of the region, which has been confirmed by the owner of the farm.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board and will take place on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 staff at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the wider internal station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim.
The employees are informed about the plans.
The change triggered the termination of the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a doctor of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
In response to the question of who should succeed, the name "Fischer" came into play, according to Jochner White, who agreed to take over the management from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means a "appreciation" in any case and a broadening of the offer in the field of "internal medicine".
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the interior.
For the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the supervisory board agrees with the agreement, should lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the miners, which still have more than 35 beds, is to be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
Until now, the district had planned to do this for 2018 when the current renovation at the hospital Weilheim has been completed.
Landrätin Jochner White, who is also Chair of the Supervisory Board, has met rumors that the House, which is owned by the Federal Reserve, should be used as an accommodation for asylum beavers in the future.
"This is what I mean from," and as it continues with the real estate, Jochner white could not say that there are a number of considerations.
At the moment there is a short time care of Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," said Fischer on the Quasi-move to the Lech, who has been accepted by the employees "positive and understanding."
There has been no real prospect for the house in which fishermen have been working as a chief surgeon for more than 30 years.
He was asked to take over the post of the medical director.
The hospital Peißenberg (once 100 beds) has always been threatened with closure over the last decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and maternity leave.
The Handballers of the Rhine-Neckar lions are called at the Bergisches HC this evening (20.15).
The table leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
In the last season, the Badener took a painful defeat at the BHC and made something good for them.
Hunting with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Aberntens of a corn field at Pratau (district of Wittenberg), several hunters were involved, as the police reported.
After a loss of fire, a thirty-year-old man and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals.
It was unclear how exactly the accident could have occurred.
It is the criminal police that are investigating this.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crime
A criminal offence has led the police to the body of the 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate who have been missing since Saturday.
In interrogation, the 20-year-old was killed, killing young people and throwing their corpses in a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to violent crime.
The young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as the public prosecutor and the police did on Wednesday.
It is also true that a 20-year-old who has been arrested on Tuesday evening, according to the fact that it has been stated, the investigators have made it clear and have led investigators to find the place where the body was found.
The 16-year-old was missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home on the eve of a fall in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal items of the victim.
In the case of interviews with the friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was finally a case of suspicion against the 20-year-olds.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the corpse was found.
According to the authorities, according to the authorities, the authorities were able to kill the 16-year-old and put the glue in the channel.
The 20-year-old should be presented on Wednesday the pier judge, the investigators put a dead letter to him.
The specific circumstances of the action are intended to bring further investigation.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense.
There are also more and more refugees who are looking for an affordable lead.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing faces a challenge.
The distribution campaigns in the German housing market have long since begun.
With the incoming refugees and job-seekers from the EU, more and more people are pressing for a market that is already overstretched in many major cities.
They are competing with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
In order to cover demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study on behalf of the association of social housing.
By comparison: This year there will be 260,000 units in Germany.
There are a total lack of 140,000 homes.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first accommodation accommodation.
Many of them then come to the housing market and line up into long queues in front of the apartments.
However, according to the Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent in the last year.
The negative development of the housing market, however, is not only about the increase in the number of refugees.
The study also makes considerable shortcomings in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is shooting a housing deficit, which is growing from year to year.
Matthias Günther, author of the study, has already been missing in the conurbations.
Many people who live in large cities therefore stayed in rooms of WG.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the Flaute on the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the alliance of "social housing" is proposing a fresh start.
New incentives are being used to stimulate social housing.
In this way, the green-value tax could be dispensed with and the base tax on subsidised housing could be suspended.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax write-offs are needed.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the state bank KfW is already well received by cities and communities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the EUR 300 million available had been retrieved on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees are free: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor.
After Hungary, in practice, there is no more, as more and more refugees are choosing the path to Croatia.
Zagreb announces that the transit via Slovenia to the north will be granted without barriers.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I talked to the Slovenian interior minister, and when it is necessary, we will organize a corridor," said the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian border, hundreds of refugees have fled to Croatia to enter Western Europe.
500 people came across the border with Tovarnik, the Croatian television channel RTL reported.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the previous day.
New laws that came into force on the same day also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police took up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the border between Serbia and Croatia.
Most of them were from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid both by bus and by taxi.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have been tempted to walk across the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serb border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
There are other dangers to this: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine clearance is supposed to create a safe passage now.
After Hungary, however, following the closure of the border, there are few refugees.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 visitors.
Shortly before Monday on Monday it was still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws make the overcoming and damage of the border fence a criminal offence.
For this reason, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
Those sentenced are in danger of imprisonment of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to information from the Immigration Office, a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established "Transedonen" (a total of 94 asylum applications), of which almost all - 93 - took the most important transition.
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children, as well as two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have been detained there.
In practice, however, no one has any prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian opinion, Serbia is a 'safe third country'.
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered together.
In Röszke, workers are starting to clean up.
They collected the rubbish that tens of thousands of people left on the road over the last few weeks.
Fences have been dismantled and one of the camps in the border town has been rebuilt.
No one wanted to express an opinion on the aim of this restructuring.
Following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria will only reach few refugees.
The country also reinforced its border controls.
According to government data, about 20,000 migrants were still in the country.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for further travel to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
Smaller groups of refugees regularly met in Freilassing.
The Mayor of the Council on the border of the border
"We were occupied by the bridge on Sunday when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent," says Mayor Alois Stadler, a mayor of the city.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because Germany on Sunday had surprisingly stopped railway traffic with Austria, it was stopped for them in Wernstein. "Stadler, who immediately offered his help, together with two other helpers and their cars across the border, had to drive across the border into the city of Passau.
Prior to that, we have been able to get rid of unexpected guests, with a drink and a drink.
We said right away that we bring them to Passau by car.
"That was, of course, for us," Stadler talks in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man was not allowed to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased with this," says Stadler.
On Sunday evening, on Sunday evening in Wels, the stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau, to try to get to Germany after the short announcement that rail traffic was stopped after Germany.
The regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein the crossing of the border is generally high.
The bridge with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday sociable, the day before a two-bridge race, is organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán is now sending further tens of thousands of us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping Röszke immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the stance of the Hungarian Government into the shadow of Nazism.
The victims of this policy are not just those Austrians who are now faced with chaos in the border areas.
They also have to note that the "promised land" that they have been invited and welcomed is nothing but a refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the continued flow of refugees and the coming winter, where we have decent conditions for those who are seeking refuge.
And it will be an even greater one - peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35.000 wintry quartz
Konrad has everything to do with the transfer of refugees.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to draw up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at Traiskirchen is already under control.
"We have no homeless in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
Also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees, who had come to Austria on Monday, was made without a fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterpiece."
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation."
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quartz in this year.
In order to meet the number, 35.000 accommodation will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it is not a bottomless pit," said Konrad.
He has already held talks with the regional champions.
They would have promised him that he would continue to work for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's good," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, who will be told how the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action "Helping like us."
On the platform, individuals can offer accommodation easily.
There are also hotels that are empty in winter.
The standards for accommodation were criticised yesterday by Konrad and Maier as "very high."
In times of crisis, it would not be possible for service providers to have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holder or the size of the upper.
For a limited time, 'emergency standards' would have to apply.
That he is more successful in the case of accommodation, in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, is based on the experience of Konrad.
I am an older gentleman who does not say the truth in the face of it.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic any cost, as they themselves have said.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Up to now, the way in which it has been established has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to place a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are obviously problems with approval.
Linz calls for a better division
At present, the city of Linz is not planning to open up urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and the design centre for the accommodation of refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as those affected can be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In the event of an emergency, however, other sites should be examined for their suitability.
The Chancellor has criticised the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also play their part here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed."
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the President of the country, Josef Pühringer (VP), has been actively involved in the refugee question on Monday.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders would not be sealed.
The continued journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, it is precisely the appropriate border controls that exist.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being.
However, the people in charge of protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Of the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity on the issue of refugees.
The fact that Austria is now also introducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence of the action of the Germans."
The next Runeastic is a question of time.
The general restoration of the "New Shipyard" in the Linzer Industrieline is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, S & T, the stock exchange that is traded on the stock exchange, is to be leased to young, innovative companies from the field of technology.
"IT are the intelligent minds of our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S & T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the New Shipyard and later also to acquire them.
Right from the start, S & T would like to cooperate with the new neighbours.
S & T has invested EUR 1.7 million in its location, 3.3 million euros from the TechCenter, which is one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Confederation (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S & T and TechCenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters in the building are already rented for a further 40 per cent.
LIA-Peroni owner opened a second business in the arcade.
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to buy a dog.
This project had to push off the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt arcade: After all, it now has an increase in the form of another business local.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop where it sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, everything revolves around women's handbags.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were rebuilt.
"I have long considered whether I should open a shop," says Breit.
One of the reasons why the decision was taken was that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were struck by the idea of a separate location where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in Linz that sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put into the cradle of her mother.
I wear the most when something is developing and I can show new trends at reasonable prices.
Why some of the women are coming out of office when they look at a nice handbag, the specialist cannot answer with the latest security.
Maybe it is because there is a nice pocket for every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump's ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called Anencoders.
This property links some with the billionaire who wants to become the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he speaks for xenophobia, concerns journalists, or reveals gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the US presidency incurs a strong campaign.
And it is a good thing to do.
This is also recorded in the Flemish Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the millions of real estate come from.
The New Yorker with the Scourge is a term for many in the Winzerdorf on the Wine Road.
Some of them are located in the area of 1200.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in electoral mode.
The Kallenstadt Simone Wendel shot a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about their goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think that this is somehow exciting, but they are not so impressed in their Kallstadter style," says Simone Wendel.
The native of Kallenstadt has filmed an amusing documentary film about the town and its famous jumps, to which, apart from Trump, the Ketchup family of Heinz is also one of them.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, will also speak in the name of Kings of Kallstadt (2014) - with the statement that he would certainly succeed if he were to live in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the king of the heart.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, it also tends to suggest that Trump is "already a bit of a great power."
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the surrounding area is "The Brulljesmacher," he says.
Trump comes out of the village of Angiver.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and the US opened a venue for gold graves.
The foundation stone of the property group was the first property purchase in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: Their desire to return to the homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged.
He did not include Trump because he was once without permission, the director of the Institute of Good History and Folklore, Roland Paul, was declared to be a movie start.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant."
In contrast, this contrasts with the descendents of the descendants.
He had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"It's not so nice," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandma was a born Trump, the opa was born Heinz").
The farmer in retirement tends to distance the Americans, "he is always so busy."
Does he believe that Trump is coming?
"I cannot imagine that," says the 72 year-old.
"He never bothered about Kallstadt."
The pension of Veronika Schramm, like some Kallstadter, says that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ, which was generally well received.
"I cannot imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if he did not vote for the election, because "it has such radical views, I do not know if that is good."
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My president is not," she says.
And: "The grapes will also be ripe without President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12 000 cinema singers, even in the US.
The Upper Bavarian village of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain auction village."
Out of the hand of the vice-president of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfenng, the 1800 inhabitants of the National Park in the National Park of Berchtesgaden received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 hiking villages.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain auction village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the evaluations, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are coming to Canberra to report the loss of the Liberals' leadership, but there have been no major shifts in the reviews of Today.
The breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators of David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week series of international TV shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed not to have a role for Australian TV viewers, as sunrise reached an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared with Today 339.000.
Today achieved a slight increase against the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today, the gap has been closed to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, the company reached an average of 318,000 in comparison to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year the distance was between 40,000 and 50.000.
On average, Sunrise is standing on an average of 349.000 spectators at an average of 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are in order, thank you for the review!
Written by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015.
The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of packaged to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently interrogated father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive figure of 1.219 million spectators.
Critics wondered whether Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The outcome of last night answered this with a clear yes.
The Seven Factor remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17: 00 to 5.30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe showed an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half-hour (17: 30 to 18: 00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia received 520,000 spectators and 720,000 in the second half.
Hot seat averaging an average of 620,000.
The decline in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot Seat will prevail at 17: 30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for millions of dollars that failed to thwart the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor of Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose?
Mystery revealed?...
Lana Jews-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may unwittingly see who The Bachelor wins.
The wife, who ended up with Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was filled with the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether they are the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked out with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jean-Fellows on the day before coming out of three, you may accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood continues to seal his lips until the final on Thursday.
All three women left out lyrically about why Wood is the perfect man, naming his sense of humour, ambition, family values, and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be one of them.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Woods last Rose?" could be their answers to the spoils of who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jevon-Fellows and Markoski named both quickly - except for themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment when I went to the house and (Sarah) and Sams's energies noticed, I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought about it throughout the course of the show," said Event-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it is so much fun to be together with her," Markoski added.
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
In their view, Mackay said that last week's house visit made it clear that Wood could be "one."
"When I saw him with my friends and the family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now fully committed to it," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not she, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast to Ten on Wednesday, 19: 30.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open workday at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomic and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne for the rest of the game when he lost a scramble as he did in his first Punt-Return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomic trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a punt-return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomic continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the match.
Instead of grinding his Rookies to the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
He also beat Hayne publicly after the match in his press conference.
The 49ers Sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Thomas McGaughey's special team coordinator, who advised him to forget his patched catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patrols in a punt that was restored in the first game area of the Minnesota Vikings.
It was certainly not the launch that Hayne and his massive Australian entourage had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the Fumble and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
"That was a thing that is happening, you just care about the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared it to his Origin debut in 2007, when a pass led to a Try for Queensland in its own goal area.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and postete it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting to discuss the rights of gay men
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian roller with force of arms.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company seized Yukos and he stopped his democratic efforts.
The Free voters are demanding the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a severe crisis in the city of Bavaria at the beginning of the autumn autumn before a severe crisis in Bavaria's schools if there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers in order to keep schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system."
The day of the elections of the Free voters takes place until Friday in the Lower Franconian municipality.
In fact, there are other main issues that were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free electorate meeting.
"Of course, the subject of asylum will be outsourced," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"This is not the way forward, we have to address the causes," said the Free voter leader.
Rejected asylum seekers want to push the free voters as quickly as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum law: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The FW boss criticized the fact that several federal states were not consistent: "We would need uniform standards of the Länder across Germany."
"Bavaria postpones, others not."
"We need to be more able to act."
But the regional policy in the city of Great Britain should not fall under the table.
One year of permanent burner remains on the agenda: The education policy is on the agenda.
For the new school year, the Minister for Culture, Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 Gymnasia, started the pilot experiment "Mittelstufe plus," in which an extension of the secondary school from three to four years will be tested, as a result of which it will take nine years until the Abitur lasts.
But Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The issue of G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW boss.
We demand freedom of choice for all Gymnasia, which they want.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
It's time to get to know what's going on.
The German stock market has ended up with gains over a wide range of envious and nervous trading paths.
Only in the afternoon, a steady start of the US stock exchanges provided a clear direction, which ultimately transported the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points.
The MDax medium won 0.54 percent to 19 552.88 points.
The technology-resilient TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1736,69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 as the eurozone's flagship index has been set by 1.01% to 3207,60 points.
Solid profits also fell on the trading places in London and Paris.
In the US, the Dow Jones index last reached about 1% in the plus.
Many traders expect the markets to take place on this Friday until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the large drop in futures on this Friday.
In the meantime, the discussion about the burden of nuclear power has left the shares of RWE at a record low, also leaving deep traces at Eon.
According to the "Spiegel," the German energy companies may lack EUR 30 billion in reserves.
The Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
As a result, the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered, but always lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose by another 3.22 percent at the Dax top.
According to a trader, a positive report by the US investor magazine "Barron" came after the weekend.
As a result, investors in the German chip maker have now paid too little attention.
In doing so, investment in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the automotive market should pay off.
Car values were asked: Even in the traditionally weak month of August, more cars were removed than in the same period last year, as the ACEA announced at the launch of the International Motor Show in Frankfurt.
The papers of the Daimler Daimler and the BMW stood at 1.34 per cent, respectively, by 2.21 percent.

4 people killed after policemen shot rubber bullets on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, a civil servant said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles to the west of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, where some of you threw stones and fire bombs.
MR Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they fell back on rubber bullets.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets, which are known to be able to kill them, which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, seem to have produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal at the southern level, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflict since the 10th.
August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, was a very controversial issue in Nepal that had been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators have voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction of the city in the city
The plot at the Emder Youth Centre of Alte Post is to be rebuilt again.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mix of commerce, trade and housing is planned - concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a large plot of about 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the Youth Centre of Alte Post.
Preparations for this are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of commerce, trade and housing.
You are waiting for appropriate offers, that is to say on the part of the city.
What the investor is in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no treaties have been concluded.
The city of Emden had bought some of the land that is located on the Ringstrasse / Corner Großstrasse, bought it a few months ago and removed the building from it.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table.
Plans for residential settlement at the Small Sea at Emden take shape.
For the first time, the investor presented public plans for the project.
Many of them are more concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure time.
For months there had been negotiations behind closed doors, heated, debated and drawn.
Now there are plans for a new holiday home settlement at the Small Sea near Emden.
On Monday evening, on Monday evening, the small and medium-sized enterprise "System-Bau," presented its plans for the first time in public.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the German Free Democratic Party, who accused investors and the management of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went to the offensive from the System-Bau management: "We have not yet got an answer to all the questions," he said to the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumours now.
The projects around ten to twelve million euros have been in discussion for months.
Violent reactions among landowners who had come to the session gave rise to the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, Meerbudenowner and member of the Board of Directors of the Anlieger, Pro Hieve, complain: "This will be a giant klotz that surprises all the rest."
In addition, he fears just like a number of other project critics that transport would increase sharply as a result of the planned size of the plant: "All bus charges will have to come out so that it is calculated," so Schulz.
What happens exactly on one hectare of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There are still no operators.
"We need to have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still lacking, the development plans would still be variable.
Gorillas at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt zoo is looking forward to seeing young people in his gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also been in Frankfurt in 1967.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet clear, as Mother Dian keeps her closely on her body.
First of all, the "picture" was reported.
NHC has a 60% chance for cyclone to the south of the Cape Verde Islands.
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Centre predicted a broad low pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south from the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60% chance of developing a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60% potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, adding to the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches the doubling donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (Googl.) announced a doubling donation campaign that is supposed to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations, because they are fleeing from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who has fled her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"On our journey, many dark train and bus journeys were included, also hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But, given that the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants: Médecins sans Frontières, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya out of war.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly obese people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in the weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial for the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity in the treatment of type 2 diabetes has proven to be effective, but most studies have been carried out on people who are sick with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is regarded as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have gathered since 2007 in a study, comparing two types of obese surgery - stomach upsets and gauntlet - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes among people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained with those who received non-surgical treatment.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% of diabetes was completely in part with 28%.
In the medical-treated group, in comparison with diabetes, diabetes was only one per cent and only about two per cent.
In addition, the results in the blood pressure controls, the triglyceride and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the 'surgical' group, which the authors found out.
Researchers also watched hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin in A1c is best kept below 7%, write the researchers.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin in A1c fell from 9% to around 6%.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But this better "glycemic control" - which is reflected in the improved hemoglobin of A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), reached larger declines in the BMI (7.3 against 5.1) and hamoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a complete escape of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that leads operation to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity were about 29% less likely to die over 15 years - comparable to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for the survival of surgery patients, Blackstone said that it was reassuring for those with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30.
"I think that we are waiting for too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult to reverse it."
Love History plays in the Hunsrück
It is a subject that is currently being increasingly taken into account in fiction: A young woman who is unpopular and unsightly at school, and after years the swarm of young people again, and this falls in love with them.
This is also the case in Luisa Binder's recently published novel.
Beyond the story of love, the novel should be interesting, especially for Hunsrück readers, because he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding towns.
The main author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama raised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, in the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"to take care of several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long-term solutions such as real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of violence.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke of the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attack of 11 September, suggesting that the violent response of the US drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and I told him that the way forward lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four times increase in the use of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States report on a nearly 400% increase in the number of children under the age of 12, swallowing up the heavily alcoholic drug abuse agents, such as the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of revenue from drug abuse in children under the age of 12 increased from 3.266 to 16.117 in 2014 from 3.266 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them ends up in the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children are drinking disinfectants deliberately, while some are doing to impress their friends, because of a test of social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol halogen water in order to get a tougher drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive disinfectants.
"A child does not think that this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapes and orange duvets, which are very appealing to children.
Hangings contain somewhere between 45 and 95% of alcohol.
Especially in young children, few spritzers can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Giftnaincall Center in the Hospital of the University of Kansas, the channel Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you would not let whisky stand out, but people leave this hand-disinfectant in range of children, and when children come to it, it is a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four spritzers from the school after a strawberry, was placed in an emergency room to be treated.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that applies to an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was not able to walk when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors watched them overnight in a separate children's hospital with signs of brain trauma, because the girl had fallen through alcohol and his head had hit Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, a number of disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died as a result of the tapping of hang-prevention agents that contained toxic non-declared access.
Employees of health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth grade in New York State planned to poison their "gema" teacher by publishing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and verbes them out of her room.
The police viewed the failed plan as "stormy" and drew disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In case of an accident on the cross-section between Nordring and Herser, a 33 year old car driver has been easily injured in an accident.
A 60 year lorry driver drove on the crossroad in the direction of the roundabout and too late realized that at the roundabout there were two cars that had to be driven at the roundabout.
In the episode he jumped with his truck into the rear of an audio track and waved it on a Ford Fiesta in front of him.
The police are involved in the vehicles involved in the vehicles involved in the accident.
The Audi of the 33-year-olds was no longer ready and had to be towed away.
Scaffolding kitchen: No Disharmonie at Celtic
Griffiths plays the talk of Disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but he'll contact them again.
Hearts will fight SFA for charges of Neilson and will be wary of January new obligations that could destroy the caste of the caste.
Increasing Leadership Over Celtic to Five Points
Adam Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a slight victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons created a five-point gap between itself and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talk about Disharmonie.
There are rumors about Disharmonie in Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths.
I do not believe that we feel under pressure, I think that the players are looking forward to this.
The lack of cover competition in football in Scotland is boring Dutch - de Boer.
The Dutch football fans have said that Dutch football fans are interested in Celtic, because there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why?
It is because the rankings are not there.
People here are not only talking about the return of the Rangers.
You are talking about the Old Firm.
They are talking about both teams and that is what they are interested in.
There is a lot of excitement in the Old Firm games, and it is not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I am going to turn things around, Deila swears.
Ronny Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss swear to turn things around.
After defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-man from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points, followed.
As Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we are going to come back again."
Now we want to get out as quickly as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We feel that this is the case, but we need to go further.
We really need the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
It is so important now to stand together.
Warburton caution in January transfers.
Despite his comments only a few weeks ago, which suggested that he made some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of signing new entrants and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox Kaders.
The former head of Brentford said: "The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic Goal Michu with withdrawal notes
Swansea striker Michu, headed by Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he could withdraw if his contract expires with the Swans.
The 29 year-old has been plagued with an annoying ankles for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA Battle for Neilson's Comments
The Hearts led 2: 1 when Paterson was sent by the field, and then lost 3: 2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months, was revoked.
Neilson remains in what he has said, and he insists: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid tynecks.
Hibee, who was unwilling to do so, was reprimanded after he admitted that he had sung a song with offensive texts on Rudi Skacel's ex-Hearts.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the striker and added: "It is sure to say that I do not return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United Management.
Simon Donnelly insists that the Board of Dundee United has confidence in the management team to turn things around, but admits that the decline on the playing field has to end.
I think that Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We are going to get the guys back on track," said Donnelly.
Mcnes is happy to "win" Hamilton "unpleasantly."
Derek Mcnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that gave them a margin of five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys's Elfmeter in the first half.
Mcnes said: "There is no team that has won, in poker games or leagues that have not won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July in 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was above the UKs of 5.5%, as the figures from the National Statistics Office (S) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland over the quarter fell to 74.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland took the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment.
It was the end of the process that had been damaged.
As security personnel were unable to resolve the situation, the staff called on the police.
It was only with the use of pepper spray that the officials were able to take the people who were in prison.
A breath of breath resulted in a figure of 0.89 per thousand.
The adolescents were picked up by his mother.
A 28 year old had 2.15 per thousand and remained in custody first.
Why I am witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
A little later, with the exception of a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.
If it happens and I hope that it does not happen, I will sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the Giftspritze.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day was closer, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I voted because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and, since applications are often available as places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Those who are selected will watch it emotionally.
I cannot do that.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossips, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months of telephone calls and two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
That is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as it wants and get access.
I complained to her.
They admitted that they "could have put it better," but they still think that it is wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written.
He does not tell me what I have to write, and I would not do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I have made.
I do not want to go into all the details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty.
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can contact.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police persecution chasing the Canning River to come from the Canning River.
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when he overcame the man of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man of Perth to hang off the police was unsuccessful when he was in a shallow and marshy water, a few metres from a police officer who tried to "persuade him gently to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale was called in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of Canning River.
But he did not get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I did not come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet, so he turned on a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car in the ditch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals were inspired by the humorous design of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to put an end to racing.
Peter Moody claims that stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He directed towards the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race of the day, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt drum of Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had been held back for 18 months for charges of espionage and did not want it to "look like too much grapes."
"I had nothing to say about it, and I have sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything will emerge at once," said Moody.
You know that it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said.
I will go home this evening and sleep well.
I want to walk around and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them.
If they start to think, I do not do that then I should not be more coach.
I then have to consider what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall.
"eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will name when I was asked - gave him jobs in my stables to provide information about what I do in my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
You seem to believe that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should certainly take their noses because they have failed in the attempt to take me.
Robert Roulette, Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this and are still today.
Should I take the view that it is going to be personal?
Did the RVL behave in a cowardly manner and perhaps blame people outside trainers for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Perhaps the people out there think out there that I am.
Perhaps they have to take my licence and break me, and I have no doubt that what I say allows them to think about it now.
But I have now reached the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to take a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The training levels of the trainer have been built with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late Scratching led him to say that he "could throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the undefeated master of black caviar, called the race treating rule "ridiculous," after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horses, which violated the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing sports.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been yesterday evening.
It could have been so yesterday, which was also the case.
But it also had it on the day of the race.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the race day.
It is a joke.
People who draw up these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here we have gone too far," said Moody.
Arrested Man After Drivers of the Driven
At the weekend, the police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist and then cursed in Cobram.
The cyclist was admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital in the Royal Melbourne Hospital after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the car driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned to Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged with curling and reduced assistance and with other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy beats against rivals because of allegations of rings.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of the Tackling of his players as "agenda setting" of two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the referee allowed the Storm to fight with his team during the High Storm victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane's coach, Wayne Bennett, made a barely disguised remark about the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, calling the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and saying that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the rings.
Bellamy defended the crew of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" in the Tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers at his team was confident, because it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This is constantly evolving - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling when they hit us 24: 2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have changed nothing about our defensive system or about the techniques, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real priority, and that is what we have done for us.
Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train, so he is unlikely to get used to it, so it was a bit of shock for him.
It is funny how this appears again at this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennetts" idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring football."
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He played his game on Saturday evening on Friday evening and it was exciting to play it," said Bellamy.
I remember that St George was criticized as a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said that he would care about a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially among his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so that they can play like them.
I have more confidence in it because they are saying these things, because they are a little concerned about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they didn't think of us when it came to Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that Storm against ROOSTERS achieved a higher result than the game of Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably a good game, I have not yet looked at it, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks and are not points something exciting?
For me it is the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet at one stage.
The Storm team is free at this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the pre-finals in the AAMI Park.
He spent $200,000 on bail in front of the drug.
A man who may be subjected to a lifetime penalty because of his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled into Queensland was released against a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America through Vanuatu and in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was observed how he encountered his co-accused in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially viable punishment for trying to have a commercial set of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence, that he tried to have the total amount, and that the cafe could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge on the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape from Maksimovic.
It has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the case of criminal cases, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 together to secure his release.
"After reading the idiosyncratic statements of the two, it is clear that the imposition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him not to appear he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he surrendered his Australian and Serbian passports, complained to the police on a daily basis and held a curling of 18: 00-06: 00.
Accident at A5 near Karlsruhe: Company that breaks apart.
In case of an accident with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe, a lorry driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three lorries involved had slowed down in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to switch to the left at the last moment, as the police indicated.
The managing house of the person who was causing the accident was completely divided.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe was closed for over six hours until 2 p.m.
This resulted in a loss of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg's phone used by girls to lure paedophiles to send pictures.
A paedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl when it was sleeping, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a number of unacceptable images of children who were sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it, found the confusing messages and alerted her mother immediately.
The police took care of the five images and analysed the computers that were found in the address and discovered "relevant" web research, which used the terms for the search for decent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet," and he then "vored to be a policeman to scare them."
The attorney Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction, that he is addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were done by him, but he said that it was because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person, who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said that he did it to attract them.
He said that he was ill in his head when he drinks and said that he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
MS Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the spreaders and on the wine.
She then saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used computers and Playstation to speak to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, was guilty in the sense of the indictment to have recorded indecent pictures of children on 14 June of last year, to have breached the conditions on 25 January of this year and not to have appeared before the Court at a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg should not appear in the register of sexual criminals, since it can be argued that "no significant sexual element" should be found in its misdemeanours.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael left the judgment until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg has been granted bail in this case, but has been held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
It was included in the list of sexual criminals before the date of the judgment.
Smugglers escape at small border crossings to Germany.
More and more refugees are being taken up away from the major points of control on the German-Austrian border.
For fear of discovery and arrest, many smugglers made people more likely to have smaller border crossings.
On the Austrian side, a spokesman for the Federal Police said.
Along the border Inn have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday, more than 1000 refugees.
They were walking over bridges and dams on the German side.
There they are taken by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration.
At the Munich Central Station, according to federal police data, far more refugees were arriving at the station in comparison with the weekend start on Wednesday.
When around 700 people arrived in the state capital only until 8 a.m, one speaker said in the morning.
Following the reintroduction of checks at the German-Austrian border, the city had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Expansion of tropical storm "Henry" in the southwest.
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, currents of warm sea air are currently flowing into the country, divided by the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart.
This is the most powerful of the tropical storm "Henry," which was pulled over the Atlantic in the last days of the Bermuda Islands.
Violent storms and thunderstorms are expected above all in Baden.
According to DWD, it is also possible to reckon in the Black Forest, in the Black Forest, on the Swabian mountains and in the sea, with the banks of between 60 and 90 kilometres per hour.
On Friday, therefore, the sun will continue to look again.
The mass makes the difference: Every two years, the buses at the IAA show their novelties.
In 2015, above all, there is movement in the compact cars that are currently selling in a particularly good way.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular: 28.1 percent of new registrations were in this segment only in August in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (audience days 17 to 27 September).
This year, many new compact models will be presented between all of the futuristic concept vehicles and the new upper class cars.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is Opel Astra, which will be at dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel's CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It is at the heart of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel has an entrance to the biggest competitor of VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current price of Astra is from 16 990 Euro.
The Astra comes with a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW / 100 horsepower.
In addition, the Hessen offers further diesel and petrol engines of 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW // 200 hp, the first of which also includes three-cylinder petrol.
In contrast to the main competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra can only be seen as a fifteenth-century.
The second version will follow in the spring of the Kombi, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And what's going on in addition to the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is going to launch the fourth generation of its Astra competitor, Mégane.
At the fair, the Mégane is to be seen exclusively as a fifteenth-century in a conventional and a rather more sporty GT version.
In trade, he comes to the beginning of next year, then as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan boom wants to find its position in the growing segment.
With its sweeping lines, the compact Infiniti fits fully into the brand's design line.
The basic model will get a gas/petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 PS.
In the offer there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: The Suzuki Baleno segment, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt, is also new.
The model is offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbomotor and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp.
The maximum torque is according to manufacturer specifications of 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The launch of Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: It's not completely new, but it is completely renovated with the compact design of the DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, designers of the noble Citroën dealer put a lot of effort in the front of the front: Redrawing the radiator and equipped with the changed headlights with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, reducing the number of buttons through a touch screen and first integrating Apple's Carplay.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants have been added at the IAA in the compact class, such as the upgraded Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin Tegel: Five square meters of cell are degrading.
The Federal Constitutional Court was right to provide an ex-detainee of the law enforcement station Tegel, which had been placed in a small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells.
This has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the judges can even hope for money when they have been locked up in the rooms for a few days (1 BvR 1127/14: 1 BvR 1127/14).
An ex-detainee with his constitutional decree was successful in Karlsruhe: He was housed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space in a single cell in the judiciary in Berlin Tegel; the toilet was not separated from space.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, is now at free, was transferred to a larger cell.
His position in office failed because of the appalling conditions of prison conditions against the country of Berlin.
However, the Constitutional judges questioned the judgment of the Berlin Chamber and withdrew the case for further examination.
They are in breach of the human dignity of the man.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation.
Even if, for legal reasons, the period in question was only a couple of days for compensation, it was said that compensation was given.
Otherwise, it would be "a fear of the legal protection of the personality."
The Chamber must now clarify the level of monetary compensation.
In the past, the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they returned compensation to a prisoner of prisoners because he was naked in a cell.
According to a decision in 2011, the multiple occupancy of one cell is without separate toilet.
In addition to this, Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Constitutional Court of Berlin, which had proven to be a prisoner of human dignity in a parallel case in November 2009.
The then plaintiff was placed every day between 15 to 21 hours, between 15 to 21 hours, in a similar cell as in the area of Karlsruhe.
In recent weeks, the Berlin prisons have also been in the headlines because of lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore always included in 23 hours of aggression, aggression is increasing, and there is already something to be done about the tense situation.
According to the Justice Department, 21 places in Tegel are not occupied because of lack of talent, and 19 are to be abolished in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We are creating that.
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is going on in Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers are expected to come to Germany this year following forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to which Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is in a position to take up one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has shown determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can create that, and we create it."
What is going on in Germany gives the following overview.
What is needed are different forecasts between 350000 (the estimate of the Federal Ministry) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) each year - for the next five years.
This is almost twice the amount that has been built (250000 homes).
The lack of housing is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental objects: 60 000 to 80000 social housing per year are coming out of the rental price, and these are particularly cheap apartments that are going to apply to refugees.
For this reason, Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the support, from the present EUR 518 million to EUR 1 billion.
There is far too little that is from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing per year would have to be created, and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion a year in this.
Scientists and federal minister agree that there must also be more fiscal advantages for investment in housing.
The Institute for Employment Research estimates that 55% of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not systematically be asked for their qualifications in order to help them, in the case of Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migrant researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political shift: From the prohibition of work for refugees to the recognition of work.
Whereas in the past a working ban on asylum seekers was for up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as has the residence obligation that restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, partly because of the shortage of skilled workers, the majority of the population has realised that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge.
Up to now, there is not yet a sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts.
This is why the construction of networks is, in the view of Thränhardt, the royal way to work integration.
Berlin's school administration has found that only a handful of parents who have fled are giving their children to the kitten, it is estimated to be ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents it is very important to keep the family together," Ilja Koschembar, speaker for youth and family, says in the Senate Department of Berlin.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes handslips in different languages.
If the need for educators is greatly increased by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would seek to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students are prepared for classes without knowledge of German.
They are not always taught by fully trained teachers but, as in Berlin, are also taught by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20% of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no country in the state of asylum is forbidden to study asylum or has been allowed to study - the only exception was Berlin, and the Innensenator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up its position.
Student refugees could be relieved of access to the university.
Refugees who have a residence permit or toleration do not receive benefits according to the law on asylum seekers when they begin to study.
In principle, the latter do not receive a Bafög, as they do not fall within the circle of persons entitled to drink.
Patient refugees have so far had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be Bafög, of 1 January 2016, shortening the span to 15 months.
This funding gap also needs to be closed, but Steffen Krach, Berlin's Secretary of State for Science, is asking for the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get straight to Bafög.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state churches should develop a new state of religion.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the newcomers professionally.
The rights also include duties.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear points of contact and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it some control.
This also involves being willing to take decisive action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Muslims' Board, Aiman Mazyek, said on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be recorded in Germany.
Those who wanted to fight such conflicts in Germany "have their right to be here, in Germany," said he in Bayrischer Rundfunk.
He proposed that the Basic Law should be translated into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be an issue for the whole of society much more than today.
This will also mean that the majority society will have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more pressing.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has, for a decade, been an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law.
But it learns very slowly, as demonstrated by the NSU murder series in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and interest groups of non-white German have been calling for for a long time and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention of Germany need to do, will have to become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and make use of its new citizens for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical services to the refugees who have been awaited.
"What is man- power and capacity, we create it," said the day mirror.
However, extra money must be invested in the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls on all arrivals to hand over health cards immediately.
Services rendered could be settled later with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited performance catalogue that the law on asylum seekers reveals.
Otherwise, doctors in particular will create the language barriers.
So far, as the Berlin Health scientist Thea Borde has shown, migrants are educated in a worse way than other patients.
It is not only in clinics, but also in doctors' practices, that the cost of interpreting should be taken over.
This would help many refugees, however, even with more general medical contact points in emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among the refugee children, for example, there is much more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
Montgomery Scott was born in London, England.
"Parasites or tuberculosis are not so hard to see," and as far as the medical shortage is concerned, the refugees may even be alleviating in sight.
The Syrians would have a highly developed educational system, several refugees, even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and perhaps once again take exams.
At least half of the refugees who are arriving in Germany are estimated to be mentally ill: Most of them suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder or from depression.
Particularly vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee is traumatized in Germany.
Anyone who is ill with a post-traumatic stress disorder suffers from so-called flashbacks with breath, dizziness, heart disease and fear of death.
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong horror and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms of symptoms from becoming chronic, it would be necessary to take early treatment.
So far, however, only 4% of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum seekers can make a request for psychotherapy in the Social Affairs, the process usually takes several months.
What is more, in social affairs, agents or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misjudgments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream of dreaming.
With the new production of "Passion" the Circus uses the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract every age group in the spell of fascinating acrobatics.
Now the circus invites you into the manege on the vaults of dreams.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine how to live without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, an animal teacher and junior chef.
"passion" - this is the motto of the current lifestyle.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family.
The gift of the family lies in the blood of the family.
"It is important to us that people should get away from their everyday straw and take them for two hours in a completely different world," stresses the 27-year-old junior chef.
Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept "a cocktail with world town flair."
50 cities on the less than 3 000 kilometres of tour can experience this flair now.
The circus programme convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Distinguished by the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo wants to shoot down.
Lightness and agility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the circus also fascinate with sensitivity and joint strength.
Balancing with the unicycle on a ball?
There is no problem for He Yuan.
Snake people are fascinated and are also alarmed.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics and is fascinated by its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," stresses Stephanies mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuses in the attitude of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes a position on this: "If our animals don't care well, we won't do well."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match unit.
The "four-legged artists" as they are lovingly called will be read according to the possibility of each request.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel comfortable, it doesn't want to be in the manege.
In other words, it is a good thing to ensure that animals are cared for.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland ponyhengst and a Zebrastute, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
"but then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of Circus Probst.
So there should be something for each visitor.
"One is safe," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether there are five or 1 200 spectators, we always give our best and are with all our hearts."
From the 17th to the 20th of September, the Circus invites you at 17 and 20 hrs.
On Sunday, the programme will start at 11: 00 and 16: 00.
Thursday is family day, the prices are reduced for the introduction at 5 p.m..
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10: 00 to 18: 00.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year.
He remained silent, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
The opening of Parliament has also been tarnished by allegations by members of the opposition that they have received anonymous death threats and they have been warned against accompanying Mr Mugabe with fines.
Last month they ordered him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - that is the speech he reiterated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones, which they warned against disturbing Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and as soon as it leaves Parliament, its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the company's services.
HP will distribute itself later this year into two publicly traded companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing enterprise hardware and its service business activities.
The expected job losses lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"This restructuring will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who is supposed to lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual sales and "it will focus on the deployment of unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for companies," so a statement by the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electric equipment and the Palo Alto Garage called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to deal with the move from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest American companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that in front of the game against Dynamo Zagreb, team members have to stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere.
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and that his rehabilitation was according to plan that there was no reason why he could not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilsh will certainly miss the next four games for England, and in the light of its history, its participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain.
The great shame on this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his knobs or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognised, there is the attendant risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an uncomfortable pattern.
The study of Premier injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of arsenals in the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight games since 2007/08 as one of the two Premier League clubs that recorded most of the days of injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"sometimes, when you come back from a violation, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in lieu of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players who need a small pause," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites, through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most serious obstacles in Europe.
Dynamo is also unchallenged after 41 games after the "unconquered" campaign was started in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with a rating of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th of Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson of the last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first Europapokal triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked out on Arsenal.
We were very close to that in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm long enough in the business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships.
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up, which has now become even more desperate than ever before, such as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged between 20 and 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common among men than women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign against a wretched life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight in order to rise to this challenge.
A recent study at more than 2,000 high school pupils with depressive symptoms found that when the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends are halved the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on the style of substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, viable and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship that has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And, as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money cannot really buy money.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned on his head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, who distinguished by the interaction as a friend.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hubris, moments at the football look in cozy armchairs and the yearning of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case, even if they often reserve themselves to explore fully their feelings.
As a member of the telephone team explained to me, "My listening role has been shown to people who feel depressed and who are suicidal."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends.
The old saying "I am right" has an enormous impact, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when one speaks openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
She clearly presents the little moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit comedy Central FriendsFest on this weekend with the backdrop for the celebration of the day, then do not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you look around Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest.
Di Maria meets to help to help PSG to crush Malmö.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to attend Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prinzenpark Stadium on Tuesday.
Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Debüts as a PSG player who led the French champion, but after that, she missed a number of opportunities before she finally increased its lead when Cavani reached a head in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk, even in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they aim not only for the qualification for the knock-out rounds, but for an improvement on the way to the quarter-final in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blancs's team, with Zlatan Ibrahimovics who missed opportunities in front of the gate, later changing in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career as early as 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it is a good start to win 2, 2: 0 to cause problems for our opponents and look back to the rest of the world, even if there are certain things that we need to perfect in the course of the season." said Blanc.
"That augurs well.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not have one or two other goals."
After his injury he returned to the Paris team, which at the weekend was able to hold a 2: 2 Undecided against Bordeaux was able to hold the First League, but he was stabbed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was designated as the man who was able to take the PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he left Johan Wiland in the long corner of the network.
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, which hit Celtic in a play off in order to reach this level, entered the field at Anpiff with nine national players and was a major opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field.
But in addition to a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed over to Kevin Trapps in the 34th minute, she offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes surfaced, with some misfortunes and bad closures, not least of Ibrahimovic, who in no less than five attempts in the first half was patched and then abandoned after Cavani had been using him after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he demonstrated a lot of skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic, who transformed Di Maria into a shooting that was diverted by Wiland in the 52nd minute of the post...
The second goal was finally thanks to Cavani.
This ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention of Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz, the final result, could be kept low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was identified at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegians said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualification games are not enough."
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from stock sales.
On Wednesday, Glencore, based in Switzerland, that is affected by the collapse of commodity prices, has accumulated $2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge debt recovery plan.
The Glencore company, registered in London, said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about $1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China's economic slowdown pushes demand and has a devastating effect on markets.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, a state visit to the US at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis first official in Washington, will take place on 25 September and will respond to President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, saying the statement.

Xavi: PEP Guardiola prevented 2008 from changing to FC Bayern.
World champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
A few years ago, the FC Bayern was close to the obligation of Spain's Superstar Xavi, which was then played for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times of Spanish Masters, three times Pokalwinner, four times Champions League winners, two times Club World Champion, two times European champion, one time the World Champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In summer he left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sports Club to Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi tells us that he was already in front of the European Championship before the end of Barcelona.
"You told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at that time," he says.
And the registered also the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria.
"Rummenigge wanted to have me."
Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern in the summer of 2008.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change.
However, the change failed to materialize.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record master: PEP Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has taken Guardiola under treaty and I have played a great EM."
"PEP said to me that I would not change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's what he got to me."
Who knows how Bavaria's season 2008/2009 would run with Xavi?
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-final of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, turned out the Red (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated at the end of the royal class triumph.
Matt Damon plays a variety of films.
Matt Damon confronted American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said that she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night of HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, in relation to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"When we talk about diversity, then you're doing it with the cast of the film and not with the cast of the show."
Brown was shocked by insulting disbelief and called "Hoo.
Damon and Brown joined the producers of Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show-finalists.
"I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever the director will be - how they treat the character of the Harmony," said Brown.
The only black person, and it is a Nutte that is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People fought for the Finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights in the film; Damon replied that "in the end there could be something that we don't want."
After the discussion was aired, the social media exploded before disapproval over Damons's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni pressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in space, so he can explain their diversity - that is SO WEISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 returns and 4,000 Likes since its release.
Damons's comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
As the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives worked nationwide and urged legislators and authorities to put a stop to discriminatory practices.
In February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Album still matter" (Albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meanings.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter have published a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"Network Black Lives Matter is a love group," said the leader.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior wins first Champion.
Professional sports climber and control guide Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $1 million.
The competition show, which closed its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all the steps of his obstacle course.
During the season, there were two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, until the final.
The last task was to climb on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task in time, and he was the first athlete to complete the exhausting Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior.
Caldiero spoke with E, news after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of profit of the Great Price of $1 million.
"I think it's amazing to think about it," said Isaac E, a bunch of money.
Suddenly, as I cannot even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
The lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and, though he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there are more than a finalist, it gets the fastest time," said Weed.
How the money is a wonderful price and life changes, it receives the great gradation.
I do not think he has any resentment.
He is so happy to have done what he has done.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He is such a great guy and a father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I should be beaten by someone, I am glad that it is Isaac."
And I think that Isaac would have felt in the same way if they had betrayed the roles.
The American Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are winding up on Minnesota's Twins.
MINNEAPOLIST -- The second half of the season wasn't particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously, they were one of the best teams in baseball.
The Tigers were reduced to their role as spoiler, but on Tuesday they played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance of climbing within a match of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard.
For Detroit, if only for an evening, it was a return of the three letter F word, which was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Innings, then in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) beat me up 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three to go.
It was only its third successful start in its last nine matches.
"I want to stop this year strongly," said Simon.
It is hard to throw any game in the bullring, and that is why I want to concentrate on the game.
The designated Tiger Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two Runs, his first since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He has waved the drum well," said Ausmus.
He looked good (percussion), he clearly looked better out of the bullring and he brought it directly into the game.
With three Runs in the back at the end of seventh Innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back into play.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the Inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a Bunt, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to Strikeout before he was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran the Wall, the only man with whom he was confronted, in front of the designated Rookie, Miguel Sano, who cut off a two-run from the border of Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe into a double play.
It was the 27th time in this season in the Major League that Plouffe proposed a double play.
After Detroit added a service-run at the end of the 9th Inning, the wall set up a RBI double against the Closer of the tiger Bruce Rondon and reached the level of 5-4.
However, the right wing left Sano in three rows for his fifth save.
Detroit is one of the most powerful drivers in the world.
The Tigers achieved three Runs in the first two Innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed from the injury list before the game after he had been missing for more than a month.
"apparently I didn't get the start that I would have liked," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches in the third inning."
After having received the Leadoff Batter, Hushes gave him a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who made a single "up the middle" during the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, another run managed, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third, ending the threat.
In the second, the Tigers achieved a One-Out Double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from Center Fielder Anthony Gose for 3-0.
"That was a great blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He has not done very well, but he has got the right job.
Hughes was in a pitch-Count that did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reliever.
At Hughes there were three Runs at six hits and a walk with four Strikeouts.
Notes: Tiger RHP Anibal Sanchez left for a breach of the limbs.
He is being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the work of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August, on the vulnerability list, should be activated for the start of Wednesday.
Using Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris will be removed from the vulnerability list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starlets with the tiger since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July.
He has been missing since 20 August because of a tie in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) is going to play against minstrotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73).
Hundreds of refugees are expected to take part in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who were involved in this should then be placed in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden rushed on Tuesday evening.
It was expected to take between 450 and 750 refugees.
Several sport halls of the Hesse state capital had been prepared for this case in the last few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can enter there temporarily.
They are to be distributed to other communities.
In the last ten days alone, the Heads of State who were responsible for the initial recording had received the holding of 7500 people in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also established temporary accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ishinger: German Military Measures in Syria
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, holds military action with German involvement in Syria.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options cannot take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of a collective approach.
Four years ago, one was pleased that the kelch of a military presence in Germany had passed by.
"Now the conflict is falling in front of our door," said he in Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid for the refugees.
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station, that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not sent refugees back to Austria.
"No, that is agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement in which Germany could host a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
Specific figures did not mention them and referred to conversations in Berlin on Wednesday.
Over the last few days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague, Werner Faymann, applied for a special summit for next week, together with a number of other EU leaders.
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls.
The EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU Ministers for the Interior want to take a new start at a special meeting on Tuesday (22 September) for the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee population in Germany, the Federal Government wants to give more support to countries in the initial collection and distribution of people.
The Bund will manage this together with the countries Merkel announced at night on Tuesday evening after almost four-hour consultations with the prime ministers at the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those who needed protection would also get it.
But those who do not have a lead perspective cannot remain in Germany either.
This view was strongly divided in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now has to deal with a "huge force."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
During the night of Tuesday, Hungary closed its 175 km long border to Serbia.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania should be closed with a fence.
This neighbouring country, unlike Serbia, is part of the EU.
Hungary wanted to prevent traffickers seeking escape routes through Romania, Hungary's Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said to the planned new border fence.
The Romanian Government condemned the plan immediately.
There were first arrests of people who cut the fence.
In Turkey, meanwhile, eyewitness reports indicate that thousands of migrants are on their way to the Greek border.
Raumsonde "Cassini" finds Ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus.
Below the ice cream of the Saturnmoon Enceladus gets a global ocean.
This includes researchers from observations of the "Cassini."
Thus, the moon is slightly swapped on its orbit around the ring planks.
This tug movement may be small, but it is too great for a permanently established body of celestial bodies, so it is called in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (New York) from Tuesday.
Researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus."
It was already known that there had to be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006, Cassini had already discovered ice volcanoes at the South Pole of the Saturnmoon, feeding water vapour and ice particles, thus feeding the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole, there should be an underground sea, which astronomers concluded then.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama was missing in 1860 Munich for several weeks.
The 1860 Munich has to give up about one month on the offensive conductor Valdet Rama.
A study showed that the association was involved in an adjuncture with the 27-year-old.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to the Munich lion, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of forced break."
"We find this difficult, Rama is a loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said SportDirector Necat Aygün of the "picture" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a unified professional.
As a trainee guest, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive.
The 30 year-old Hrvoje Cale in Belgium was also active in Belgium and was also under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
At present, the crocodile has "the possibility of proving its skills."
Torhunter Rubin Okotie can return to the team training next week after its brains.
Already on Thursday the Austrian national player will get into the running training.
Okotie had been injured in the play of Fortuna Düsseldorf (0: 3) in a fierce collision with his head.
Despite the initial fears, he was left without a serious sensation.
No diet fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar.
Mangoes are exotic and juicy.
But those who want to take care of their slim line are often discouraged from doing so.
Because mangoes contain a lot of sugar - especially sucrose.
Exotic fruits are healthy: In them they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. and above all, there is a lot of vitamin A and the pre-stage of beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, the immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When you buy, mangoes should not be too soft or too strong.
The shell colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, you can taste pure or sweet dishes.
A mango also gives a hearty meal a special touch.
It relieves the slightly bitter taste of some of the leaf species such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well to fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US package service UPS provides up to 95,000 items for the US Christmas business.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, as UPS announced on Tuesday.
Drivers in particular are being sought.
Already last year, UPS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95000.
In the face of booming online business, UPS and its competitor, FedEx, have been making arrangements since last year to prepare for the Christmas deal.
In 2013, delays had been caused by the package services.
The first wave of fires, then striking cold front.
In the coming night, in the valleys of the Alps of the Alps, you can see how MeteoSwiss announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and during the night on Thursday, the hair dryer is blowing partly with storm strength through the valleys of the river valleys.
After arriving on Thursday morning, we are crossing a prominent cold front, which brings heavy rainfall, wind gusts and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest flow.
On the northern side of the Alps, in the night breaks through the valleys on Wednesday.
As a result, the hair dryer is blowing from 60 to 100 km/h on Thursday morning, in some cases and especially in the Urnerland with more than 100 km/h.
From time to time it is possible to get up to the surrounding meadows and on the mountains are even orkanlions of more than 120 km/h.
While in the north on Wednesday, high temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees are caused by rain, the humidity starts to soar.
There is a lot of rain that lasts until Thursday evening.
In sum, the south of the Alps has to be calculated in the next 48 hours with some over 100 litres of rain per square metre, as a lot of rain has fallen over the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the air is coming out of the air, following a cold front with strong, partly weathered rain from West to East over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind is sipping up sharply, and temperatures are clearly declining.
The following days are presented in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, but in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a King of Martin Luther
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday, a nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on the name of the German reformator.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as "German theologian of the Reformation."
The park is located in the very heart of Rome, right next to the Coliseum.
The name was requested by the working community of Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelic Lutheran community in Rome, reminded us that in the town of popes, over centuries as a minority, the Protestants were often able to live their faith only in secret.
With the place, it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome as a young Augustinian monastery around 1510/11.
He found the city to be a scapegoat at the time.
According to historians, his negative impressions should have reinforced him in his subsequent struggle against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the church of the West.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible.
Jesus with the (gold-plated) village krone is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
What was the word at the beginning?
No, not in the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who, in 150 motifs, formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has received the 75 year-old - but that is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary, it is something that can have a very grim effect.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books.
The result is cycles that are devoted to topics such as the crossing, the precursors, the bids or the fades.
In doing so, he has spontaneously captivated several partners: The Luther Verlag with its theological orientation as well as the Kettler-Verlag with its emphasis on art books.
And there is the author, Klaus Altepost, who has studied the Bible on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible texts selected by Otmar Alt, translating it into reality into reality.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quotation of Martin Luther and each one of the artist who formulates his personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry band has golden letters.
The 75 year-old gives a deep insight into his soul and his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the catalyst for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler.
"Education already happened with the pipe," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to do that, so that I may have to stand again with the Lord."
His second concern is to enhance the value of art in a fast-paced time: "The perception of educational worlds is now characterised by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is being squeezed out.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Images always have some secrets and are not decorative.
"In this respect I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to drop into the pictures, let them work, discover and feel the power that they have: "The image is looking for his counterpart."
On Tuesday, on Tuesday, when the Otmar Alt-Bible was presented in the Otmar Alt-Foundation, "always" was a lover of Otmar Alts's art: "I like how he conceives with his pictures."
Old did not take care to capture the Bible fully, but selected the topics that are important for him.
"This was not cooperation on equals," says Altepost: "This is about the images that text only explains."
For Hans Möhler of Luther Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Alts's images speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Some of the originals - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November in the Otmar Alt-Foundation.
Breaking the Road for BMX Train
Plans were made, space found, companies commissioned, the earth modeled for a circular course: A year later almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX track it was already finished.
Shortcomings in politics and administration were causing confusion, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railways.
So the hill in front of the hill looked for new space - now with formal planning and application for construction approval.
The approval will take place in October, the First local councillor, Sabine Mosebach-Bock, has now been able to communicate in the children and youth committee.
"I hope that this year is still happening," she said.
It would be possible to start work with the former indoor pool without a "further period of commemoration."
Intensifying Engagement for Refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019. The Bundesliga will send out a clear signal at the weekend.
Football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and ensures its help in dealing with the problems that lie ahead.
"I think this is our country's greatest challenge since reunification."
"In principle, no one can say that I am not doing anything, I have nothing to do with it."
"This has to be of interest to everyone," said DFB boss Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am in the chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of the State of Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"The subject will certainly play a central role," he announced.
Football can and will help.
However, the decisive course must be set for politics.
The German Football Federation has therefore expanded its Refugee Initiative "1: 0 for a Welcome" by four years.
"On the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," said Niersbach, at the margins of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's and Malta.
Some of the federalists are also supporting this programme.
As early as this weekend, the 36 professional associations are sending out a clear signal when they are going to wear the print "We help" on the left.
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only be," said Leverkusens Sportchef Rudi Völler of the "picture" newspaper (Tuesday), describing the project as "self-evident."
"The refugee drama goes to everyone, no one can look away."
"We can support football, no, we need to use our beam, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig talked about a "prominent sign of the league."
For the European Championships against Hungary on this Friday, the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community of German football."
It would be great if all 36 licensing associations had started their own projects in their places.
It is just as great that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1: 0 for a welcome," which we have spent, is lived in football.
"That is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next year, the association, together with the selection of the DFB and the Federal Government, provides EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already picked up the entire sum for 2015," reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP Board of Management loses an eye in the event of an accident.
The Chief Executive of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost the left eye by a fall at the beginning of July.
During the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the United States, after midnight, he fell on a glass of water that he carried in the left hand, reporting the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He is almost dead, he was powerless, she then went out to the street - he told us last week," the WiWo quotes "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
However, McDermott could pursue his work.
"At the beginning of October, we meet in Walldorf before the Supervisory Board meeting," said Plattner.
The 54 year old manager at the meeting was "fully operational."
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he will return to Germany in October and will continue to run the software group.
"I am fully in my job for SAP."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner," said McDermott.
McDermott usually commences between Germany and the US, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important for him to go to the public with such a personal history, said the manager of "SZ."
"It is important to stand up again when you like."

Football: BvB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the Gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have been shattered definitively.
The national player will be missing from the table leader of the football Bundesliga also in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7.00 pm / Sky).
"We cannot use it," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
If Reus is going to be back in the Bundesliga on Sunday, the BVB coach left it open: "We expect a return of him to the training on Friday."
In view of the high loads of its professionals, Tuchel is going to change its trunk not only on the Reus site.
So he announced a change to the goalkeeper position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of chief keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all European League games in the future, however, Tuchel has been open.
With a high probability, he will also play the second game.
He also announced that he would be able to find a way to ensure that the final suit for the BVB in the Europe League should be the goal.
"I think that we have a good chance to grab the title."
Robotic Cars: Government in charge of Germany
According to the government's wishes, Germany is supposed to be the leader in the transformation of cars.
On Wednesday, the Federal Railways decided to adopt a strategy paper from the Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes, among other things, investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke in Frankfurt on Wednesday, on the edge of the Automesse IAA, from a "new mobility era."
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and will ensure less congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also intends to discuss the subject with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband and a rapid transition to digital radio.
For the testing of new technology there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to prevent the driver from being saddled with any additional risk of liability, the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments.
For example, Germany wants to ensure that the permissible maximum speed for self-driving cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government would also like to argue in favour of a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for the man as a driver.
When it comes to automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead and the driver will be more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics, it will be technically possible to travel on motorways by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles are to be expected on public roads "only after 2020."
The value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German location is valued by the authors of the study for 2025 to around EUR 8.4 billion.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said the SPD politician, Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data must clearly be clarified.
Still, Germans are skeptical about cars - much more than French or Americans.
A survey by Forsa-Institut on Wednesday by the Forsa-Institute on behalf of the Institute of Testing comes to the conclusion that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonomic cars will prevail over the next ten years, 32 per cent of them only expect 31% in 20 years, and 31% of them do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21% of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, in the US, 33 per cent.
Anyway, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
Following a survey by the Digital Association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to control the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, the traffic could be 15% in the traffic and 45 per cent.
It would not be possible for anyone to control the car under any circumstances.
Boll says team and double-start at table tennis.
In addition to this, it will be possible to make a selection of the most exciting events in Düsseldorf.
The final decision should be taken on 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys heard it in the morning."
"We are strong enough, even without Timo," said Bundestag Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf.
At that time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term and agreed sponsor in China.
The 34 years old German champion is expected to be returned on Friday.
"Without Timo is the drawback, we are no longer such a clear favorite," said single European champion, Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who directs the list in Jekaterinburg, also reminded us of the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time, Timo was also missing, and we became the European champion."
"We should be guided by this," said the world's ranking fifth.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has taken a serious breach on the right leg.
In the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was met with a Tackling from Héctor Moreno and changed after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis was hinted at by the 20-year-old player of Bastian.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible.
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figure of gray: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) has presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: Mannequins that look alarmingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonnas's stage outfits - and the fact that he put men in skirts.
"I cannot say today that I am the Enfant terrible of Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"In the past, it was easy, now it is genuine," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk - From the sidewalk on the catwalk, which is to be seen in the Kunsthalle of Hypo Cultural Foundation on 18 September, it is a good thing that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
"For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you arrive in the museum.
The impressive collection had already been done in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris.
"It's about so much more than beautiful dresses," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographic piece of art for which a lot of effort has been made.
14 tons of material have been found in Munich according to information of the Kurator Thierry Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special highlight: A leather pants outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different.
Even Gaultiers of old teddy can be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first and tentative styling of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and ill in football), he had attracted his teddy bear, Gaultier.
To play with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
He later taught himself to derail fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers like Gaultier in Munich.
Later I bought it of course.
For his first own fashion show he was unable to pay the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Top as Fashion Nic.
In the past it went to the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen and wanted to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were produced in large quantities for customers who, for example, used them to blankets and to curtains.
This alone doesn't work anymore, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Moacher.
Instead, fashion is important again.
Fashion played a larger role in the early days of the get-together, and it was then replaced by the home textile industry - and it is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt calls some examples: Lace in jewellery, for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes.
In fact, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past brickwork, is a growing potential for orders.
Anyone who does not use niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Together with a group of nine other companies, Modespight is a member of the industry association with many shops in the Netherlands.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80% of sales have been broken.
Private business and wholesale business are no longer available.
Our products hardly reach our customers in this way.
The bulk goods are now produced much more cheaply in the Asian region and almost exclusively driven by chains.
It also weakens exports, currently after Russia and the United States.
So there are plenty of reasons to do so.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains by the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "Since this year we are introducing a quality seal that shows that we are producing ecological and socially acceptable production."
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used."
Diplomat teaches at the Schneeberger branch at the WestSaxon University of Applied Sciences Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter competition from the Asian region, we need to find high quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the most recent ideas from the designers and the companies that need to think economically," says Schmidt.
That's why an existing design is often easily varied to keep a client base.
A few years ago, textile designer, Kati Reuter, revived the historic snowball.
The machine in some places stifles small chunks.
The party in Bianca Hallebach was inspired by the witches of gold in Bianca Hallebach. "Perhaps I couldn't do anything with traditional plausibility."
Now she is using the snowball for her jewelry.
In a costly procedure they shape the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener - young and old," says Reuter.
It is also delivered to the USA, to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and surrounding areas and who want to have a souvenir.
In this way I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the head of the city.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" film.
Legend is that you can't touch legends, but Disney still dares to take a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins."
However, according to the "Entertainment Weekly" it is not a new film, but a continuation that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the experiences of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Anyone who plays Poppins in more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is certain: Rob Marshall, most recently "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
XI urges the broader economy of the world to be opened up to the world.
The economy needs to open up wider outwards in order to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday a group charged with steering reform.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve the strategies for business start-ups," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Board for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting start-ups and reforms, creating new momentum and vitality, and providing new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a set of directives, including a negative list of rules on market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and an overhaul of the resident reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is created, identifying sectors and companies that do not qualify for investment.
The system is gradually being tested and improved through test programmes.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also relax controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to do business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
As part of a bid to open state-controlled sectors, other areas of private investment will be opened up.
"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
It will also make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optimising requirements and making the application process easier.
The right of lawyers to practise their profession and use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The session also included Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
The EU wants to double mercury limits in overfishing
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in major predators and give consumers a much higher dose of the nervous system.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, who has a corresponding working document of the EU, criticised the plans sharply: "Risks and side effects of miscellaneous industrial policy and environmental policy are passed on with full force for pregnant women and toddlers," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, for 'economic policy reasons' should be raised from one mercury to two kilograms of fish.
However, major predators are already so heavily burdened by mercury that about 50% of the catch cannot be sold on the basis of the limit values that are still in force.
After a doubling of the limit values, only 14.5% would be unsold.
In exchange for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligram mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch referred to this as "trick," because smaller chants, such as carp, are usually so low that they are already meeting the targets today.
The reduction in paint is therefore "a perfidious diversion that will help the economy alone," explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which is heavily enriched by the food chain, especially in predators.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already low quantities can cause damage to the nervous system."
The Federal Ministry of Environment has stated on its homepage that it is not expected to be "a health hazard to the general population."
In particular, mercury comes into the environment through the incineration of coal.
According to a written report by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two thirds of the total emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example, in the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, was "permanent and widespread," the "Spiegel" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already the most common health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
