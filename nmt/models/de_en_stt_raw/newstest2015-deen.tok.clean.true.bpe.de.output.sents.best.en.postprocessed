Reverting to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a legislative proposal in order to establish unions as civil law.
"As unions die, the middle class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, and Deputy Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud of John Lewis's staff of staff.
This breakthrough law gives workers the equal legal opportunities for discrimination on the part of the organization of unions like other forms of discrimination - and stops anti-union forces.
The amendment to the national employment law, in order to create a possibility of discrimination to recruit workers to the organization of union representation in order to sue before a civil court for justice - and to obtain damages or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative, or at least American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal are suggesting is the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks to which the unions have been subjected in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries throughout the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, extend and comply with labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of unification in one go.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and its staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy, Hedki Tojos, was replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the role of the workers and their unions in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "workers" rights to unification and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight, David Eisenhower and his baton, urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers should organise themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans included a clause that explicitly said: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve labour and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements that restrict or restrict this right are null and void; targeted measures are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Human Rights Commission, which was drafted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as it was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors guaranteed that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect its interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
As a country in which other countries beriet how to shape civilian and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to the creation of a union - and the fact that the trade union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government offices - should be protected.
Indeed, after shelling these rights in America, it is very wise to see the American ideal, that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now all of them are aware that the workers' movement does not limit the nation's strength, but magnified.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History reminds us, and that is what we should do.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America great in the past and that triggered the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporarily the law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana may be forced to close down.
A federal judge, on Sunday, stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, by telling lawyers that it would probably have led to the closure of all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, which Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, was charged with in June and is supposed to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out abortions to purchase a hospital at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work according to the law as they seek to gain these rights," wrote Federal judge John Degravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing will be held for the judge in order to bring about a more durable decision for the law.
Abortion welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures, and the fact that doctors spent more time to obtain the rights of hospital.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are avoiding a lawless law that aims to deprive them of their health and rights," said President and Chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, Nancy Northup, which had complained on behalf of three of the state's five hospitals to stop the law.
It was not directly clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics, who had not joined the case and had also applied for right of referral.
Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have enacted similar laws.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the remaining clinics to close down were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that intervention rights by physicians require unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion believe that the measures serve to protect women's health, even though some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only a doctor who carries out abortion in Louisiana has access to patients, sharing the centre for reproductive rights.
When all other doctors are forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would not do the surgery because of fear of its security.
When they argued against the ruling, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, during which applications for patient participation are still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to increased death rates by ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video for her mother, who died in 2007 from ovarian cancer.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than to women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women, who detected ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25% were on life only 25% after the diagnosis.
The research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and peripheral regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDIE: New drugs could slow down lung cancer and ovarian cancer.
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, existing precursors, and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had already progressed further at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and peripheral regions of the state, mortality was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors for this.
"This illness is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in major cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services, in order to counter the distances, it proposed as a possible remedy a reinforcement of the service of piloted doctors in order to provide specialists with the opportunity to provide women more closely to their place of residence, as well as to treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical status, the study found a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and emphasized the need for better treatment and precautionary strategy.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years of gold, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
The Garden of Garden
The decline, along with a stronger decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year when today's young consumers arrive after a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55% of the amount that people spend with home for their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular procedure, the front gardens for parking purposes, and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, which is estimated to be £5 billion a year in sale.
In greater London, over a period of 6 years that has fallen from 61% to 43%, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household will be reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, manager of the RHS, said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when they move around."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail trade, owing to rising homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980's to the mid-1990s.
It also forecast an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather conditions after mild weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the cleric Tahirul Qadri movement in Pakistan continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators have climbed the public television station PTV.
Information minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back to PTV buildings.
The transmitter has been operating for a period of 40 minutes, but has now returned.
At the same time, around 3,000 demonstrators have tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometer, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped with clashes with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters called for the resignation of Sharifs, but he rejects them.
Meanwhile, the country's army continues to call for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using force."
After meeting at the headquarters on Sunday night, the military said: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Premier Sharif of having cheated at the parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests were escalated at the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters to invade Sharifs' residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey ordered US diplomat for spying
The Turkish Foreign Office has appointed the country's oldest US diplomat to information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the office of the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel, as well as the online magazine The Intercept, show that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a main practice area for the US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all the major countries were spied on each other.
A previous report that also targeted Germany's main secret service, Germany, caused much angry reactions by the Turkish Government.
Warning strike: Drivers are in danger of commuters.
The federal warning strike of the train drivers on Monday night could also affect the movement of persons in NRW.
The booth, which has been announced for 18 - 21 hours, will cover all transport companies across the country, including the long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the transport of goods.

Said the head of the head of the union of the German locomotive (GDL), Sven Schcentre, in Düsseldorf.
We are seeing a lot of accidents.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the transport of goods.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything possible to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so that it was difficult to predict the consequences specifically.
Police Chief of Magaluf of Corruption
The Prosecutor presented evidence to the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday for blackmail by the police and employees of the city of Calvià.
The head of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption charges by businessmen and bartenders in the notorious Binge Drinking Hotspot Magaluf.
Main Commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, has been arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where the most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to information from the online daily Majorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of the police and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor for fighting the corruption of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local policemen were arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the corruption charges and are consulted jointly with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that angry night smart owners had said that the authorities had serious implications for their business.
"It is no longer a matter of money, it is about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Let our livelihoods be out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer because of a viral YouTube video, in which a 18year-old British tourist was shown.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the illegal behaviour of alcoholic tourists in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants to the infamous alcohol-related Kneipp.
The Playhouse Club, in which the stud was held, was forced to close a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage together have to pay a penalty of $55.000 ($73.000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British tourists, is also known for a number of accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of the "Balconing," where people jump from a balcony to the other or from a balcony in the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet weather conditions and weather conditions affects flights to Adelaide airport.
The FRÜHLING has brought a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong wind, to flights from Adelaide airport.
On the evening up to 9 pm there was a further 5mm rain to the town, after 6,6mm, which had already fallen to Sunday in the night.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy winding, including a bus that started just before 20 and caused almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the spring of last week, the temperature in the city fell to a peak of only 15.8 ° C on monday.
The gusty weather has probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a bit wind - a sudden change in the wind speed or direction - and it had to run through.
At that time, windmills reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide airport.
The flight details showed that the aircraft also had to start on a second landing flight and finally set up at 20.40.
Flight delays led to the arrival of several other flights, including a Dubai flight from Dubai, and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible swings.
Matthies believes that it is time to move to the big networks.
In view of the proximity of technical advances that threaten to turn our cozy home into high-tech switchgear, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforted with a very familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this here, I notice my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone, and I think: Boah, as retro is that?
But there is a thought behind this: If the cable weren't, all listeners would fly around in the house as soon as possible, and that would be much more retrospectively.
In any case, it is on ekeltronic (ekeltronic)?
No, typing errors: Electronic) sector is the rule that is today the electrical waste of tomorrow bought - outdated.
Those who, for example, still have a tube of television in the living room, however, merely say that they are opposed to television as a matter of principle.
What is the reason for these considerations?
It is because the pressure on the radio tower this week brings our absolute incompetence to questions of electronics.
Today, the Laie, who used to control the washing machine and the CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread to him by means of untouchable expert speak: "connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies."
Yes, we are still talking about it?
What are we supposed to talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread out such Quark?
What we have basically been doing for about 20 years, of course, is that we should be able to link our home.
In order for the yoghurt to be reordered, in order to tell us that there is a shortage of work in the Maldives, we would like to tell you that the fire alarm is in the Maldives.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were from the office out of the air conditioning to our early arrival?
Yes, it is one that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We're going to lift our wristband, say it according to her!
Misleading.
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution: "The limits between white and brown goods," raunt a branch of the industry, you can connect the washing machine with a headphones, you can connect the washing machine with a headphones, the boiler sends the weather report and the data brides to how long the pizza needs in the oven, but nothing is good because we are in the building.
We also know from the daily practice: When a modern device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed.
What is another reason for this is that the spiral cable will also survive the next radio show on the phone.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas close to the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after they had spent the summer in air shelters, when missile and mortar damage to their communities went down during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and closed the schools in Gaza, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school start brought the communities in the south of Israel to the communities marked by rocket attacks, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod removed staff of the "Pashosh" nursery, which was taken by a missile, before the arrival of the students of Granatsplitter of the walls and shooting signs.
"We're a little afraid, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, friend at the Kibbutz Saad and his English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said that it feels "a bit weird" to go back to school suddenly.
"That was a difficult time, and we have not gone out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz close to the Gaza border in order to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire fell last week, thousands of residents of the border communities, such as Saad in their homes, left their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza into safer areas, and avoid the missile and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer grenade, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said that a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were housed temporarily in other schools.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town on Gaza, which is badly designed by the Palestinian fire.
He called on the children, to learn a great deal and said "We will ensure that their knowledge acquires them and gives you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an indefinite ceasefire.
The ceasefire has provided an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for the removal of the Israel-Egyptian blockade to Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to start again this month in Egypt.
During the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them were killed, and at least 494 estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the people killed are combatants but do not provide concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar shells during the fighting to Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza region, and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be open so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amari, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza.
After election in Saxony: CDU Vice Strobl calls into question NPD.
In the light of the loss of votes by the NPD in Saxony, the CDU Federal Republic of Germany has declared itself in favour of an end to the current "NPD" procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU Federal vize Thomas Strobl, the current prohibition against the NPD should be brought to an end before the German Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is worse off than at the last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU country head in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung."
This is a welcome development in the right direction, a development that leads me to the result that the NPD are fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD, at the vote on Sunday, had almost failed to reach the five percent hurdle.
A first start to a ban on the far-right party was a failure in 2003, because at the time constitutional protection also had informants at the NPD.
After a long period of preparation, the Federal Council presented a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag were not united.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the newcomer place, refugees are now housed in tents.
The main starting point for refugees in Harburg is bursting at all seams.
Now, the interior authority has lined up three tents of the Red Cross.
The regional leaders were informed as soon as possible - they were a little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions are still stirring up the citizens' reservations and will not allow regional leaders to contribute constructively to the humane housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Chairman of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance at the Harburger County Assembly.
Their party demands that the district administration of Harburg to provide unexploited houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reason for overfilling in the initial recording is the rush of help - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide enough places in follow-ups.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
House prices have seen the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1% in August, the RP data of Monday.
The increase is 4.2% in June, July and August, the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than twice the level of the 12 months ending until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread over the country.
The RP Data Research Board, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne drive a two-handed market.
The figures by RP Data show that home prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, compared to 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where prices rose at an average of five and six per cent.
The other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government spending, and where the price of the year rose by only 1.4%.
Mr Lawless further said that with the start of the spring there would now be an increase in the real estate sold next months, which would run the market "a real test."
"When we look at the ongoing high rate of auction prices, a generally fast rate of sales, and the constantly low interest-rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise further over the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts statements by the Managing Director Peer Medau and attested to it "as a Feldherr."
The style of the college is not, that is, in the communication.
That is how the Medau family had already been informed about the work of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July are definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, it points out that the plans are not about "prefixes, or even decisions, but of preferences."
Also the extension of the narrow road to the castle to the castle is also less dramatic than feared by the Medals.
Of a nine-metre road, was and is not the speech.
The current status is at 5.50 meters, which is a metre wide than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and owed parking areas will be used only by students of the university will not be allowed to apply.
It is not covered at all because this can be solved intelligently, now just as in other public car parks.
Thinking of the residents
The crèche, which is located on the grounds and would lead to the entrance to the parking deck, is supposed not to be affected by the president's president.
Rather, he admits that this is not only about the crèches here, but also about the inhabitants of the arrival to the Friedrich-Streib street and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring Realschule.
It is much more than the vested interests of Mr Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the critique of the parental council of the crèche, with the development of the road would be allowed to be "the very few natural spots of Coburgs", "the reader himself can decide for himself."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, will inform the city councils about the development of the university by 2020 and address the importance of the new development in this context.
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery school plans last week about the college's plans.
Thus, the access to the new parking deck should not lead to the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but rather to the Medau Mountain.
This would require a two-track expansion of the small road at a distance of about one kilometer.
According to the projections of the Medals, traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would be tenfold.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles a day.
Until now, the city has not wanted to express its views on the project.
Glandorf is coming out of handball national team.
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Federal Republic of SG Flensburg conducted a number of health problems for this decision.
I did not like the decision, it has been matured for several months.
It is for me time to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the 2007 World Champion shared on its Facebook page.
He thus goes to the international retirement with a balance sheet of 167 countries and 576 goals for Germany.
He is now no longer available to the new Bundestag, Dagur Sigurdsson, who wants to go to Torejagd for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few years.
With the Icelanders, who announced on Tuesday that the country matches against Switzerland, Glandorf conducted a long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as they will delight my long-time fellow players and my successors.
But for my club, I would also like to be well available over the next few years, for it is necessary to have a long-term regeneration that does not allow for the current level of duplication.
In 2012, the left-wingers had to fear their careers at the end of 2012.
Due to Achilles" s problems he had been treated by team doctors of the Deutsche Handballbundes (DHB) with a cortisonic injection, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the argument ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional life and eleven years of national career do not pass by a single body.
I have some health sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infectious foot operations, which were carried out at short intervals in 2012, I have never got my blood pressure right into the handle.
There are a number of other veiled complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I realized that I headed my head but could not fool my body," Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine "Handball Time."
For a comeback, it would be available only in absolute emergency.
"When all stripes tear, I am always ready to talk," explained the two-fold family father of the trade magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can play handball.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble in relation to my health.
After my career, I would like to be able to go at least to some extent.
In addition to the World Cup of 2007 and the win of the Champions League 2014, in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo), he took the EHF Cup.
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup with Flensburg.
German Economy at 0.2% in the spring
The crises around the globe have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2% from April until the end of June 2014.
This was shared by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone fueled the economy in the spring, while investment went back.
External trade, too, has slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual action, a GDP increase of 0.8% over the second half of 2013 will be a 0.8% GDP increase for the first half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the Münsterland Mooiste, which led to the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmans town of Horstmar was invaded by Dutch "Fietzenrider" on Sunday.
The largest bicycle sport association of the Netherlands, NTFU, hosted the "Münsterwa-Mooiste."
It's the biggest bike tour across Münsterland, which is close to the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked him for the organisation of this trip by the Münsterland.
The tour has been offered to interested parties in various specialist journals.
We come from Den Helder and drive overnight in order to take part in the tour.
We also want to get to know the Münsterland also in this way," the cyclists cheered the route through circles around Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration in the club of the Schützenborn Sta.
Catherine went to a little "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the launch also took place.
The route continued to Horstmar in the direction of Herrenholz in the direction of Herrenholz to the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld, via Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres with 1475 metres and 1475 metres of altitude, cyclists proved their good physical condition.
They were on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer, Jos ter Huerne and Mayor's representative, Heinz Lölfing, was very happy about the success of this cycling event.
We are happy and it was a nice experience for all those involved.
The organisation performed without problems and there were no negative events," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants were present, as the organizer had hoped, which was probably because of the bad weather forecasts and on the morning.
"We are going to see nice weather again on 30 August or during a different weekend in 2015," the cyclist promised to return to the Münsterland and start planning a new event.
He was arrested and sentenced to death.
It is actually more philosophical testimony than Biography, which brought Konstantin Wecker, Songmacher, pacifist, politiis activity, ex-prisoner, to 287 pages on paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more ideas for the movement of ideas has been written by Munich on 1 June 1947, where each chapter begins with an appropriate song text.
And he is ruthless: From the Onanie, as a high school to shoplifting, he leaves no human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow men.
Broad space also takes abstract, but the more important terms are: Love, soul, ego, the being in now, spirituality - all this tries to go to the ground, on a very philosophical, but very personal way.
And he also explains its pacifism, its social critique, its political engagement - and, as it does not only have music (opera lovers became a soul and a rock musician), but also his imprisonment.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the asketic monk, who is "through subtraction," as he says, "by leaving everything out of necessity."
There are also brief anecdotes about the earth between all of the highly spiritual views: For example, there are thugs in a GIs, or a crazy car at which he targeted a tree.
There too he is ruthless.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me to the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tested for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, who was partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with vivid melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, just heard his voice: "Listen to the collar.
Let your sister be quiet.
Go away!
I want to look at cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub and talked about things, such as the form of beer or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life he was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than at the time of his father, he won an insight into how life might have been for him.
It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, rough, deep stylized labyrinths, with piles of flame and smoke, and a lot of soot.
My father used to sit in the tub before and then you could hear him slowly, as he started to sing, because he could wash the foundry.
When I went there, I realized that he had done that for years in order to put food on the table and respect for him.
Nevertheless, Henry, as a child, grew up without love of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went badly at the end of her life, we began to say "I love you.
With his daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he was missing as a child.
Could you stop saying "I love you?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still a friend of French that he was married to 25.
Dawn is a good person.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys's mother's mother was diabetic.
That helped to kill her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said that you need to be radical.
So I pulled this fitness and I also had to make a drastic diet in order to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is hard.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henrys's career in career may be reflected in his elegant, low-cut bar.
Ever since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he was captured by the theater.
It followed The comedy of the wrongs, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled its busy working life.
He started at the age of 16 when he worked at a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was for a very long time the only black imeditor on television."
He learned at work.
I had to live not only before the eyes of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an effective Witze story machine while I was on television as a star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 on New Faces
Because his manager had the stage at Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people had "black anmold," Henry introduced his comedy there for five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I somehow wish that it never happened, but I am not sorry that I did.
It was a curious, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a big audience.
But this "longlasting, light pillar of British television" was also "a grotesque parody of the black people."
In the 1980s, by introducing figures that were celebrating British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comic circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry show went on broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties, among others, when he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie head!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series, and film roles were preached for the next decade, but according to his BBC series LennyHenry.tv, 2008, he thought: "What do you do next, because everything feels like it is the time you just have time or a little on the spot."
After that, a documentary series for Radio 4 came with the title What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was totally allergic to Shakespeare.
I never learned anything at school and held him mostly for a domain of the middle class, white in pantyhose, and a cabbage head.
So I was very afraid of it.
All who interviewed us for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, "You should try it.
Don't do it badly if you don't know what you are doing.
Take a couple of words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave 20 lines of Othellos for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally got the head right.
"That is what it is all about, it is a serious matter, they take your text, people are searching a little bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read it for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car crash, and that simply did not happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the wrongs.
Suddenly I was in the national theater and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed you."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me "You now have to bridge 10 minutes while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage manager proclaimed that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and anything in me said "Oh, thank God."
I am not responsible for it.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stick in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre.
The text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, this strengthens the tendons.
That too was good, so it is like a large sign of the gods who tell me "This is your destiny."
It says this, of course, with a vote that has been made.
So I stand by it.
I really love that.
I love to be in a sample room.
Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is criss-crossed by humorous eruptions, while he always imitates people.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of stranger is somehow dangerous.
If you look at them forever, you are going to go to a wall.
I sometimes go live in the Apollo, if I want to do it, but overall I do not have as much as I did before.
I ask him if he will do a stand-up Comedytour again.
The fun that I have in one room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a central part and the end of a journey - I do not think that I ever ever want to give up.
Is this the new incarnation of India?
I think so.
I am happy to have an actor.
It is fun.
One story always tells, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels blocking roads in Yemen's capital city
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis have been called to civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi supporters would have occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman of the Huthi Party "Ansar Allah."
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report about a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Lawal Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had been called on to take action on Sunday night.
Huthi, according to figures on the leaf, were threatened with a further escalation of the conflict, should its demands not be fulfilled.
The Shiite Huthis are fighting for more independence from the Sunni-led Yemen and are calling for the government's resignation.
The tribe of the Huthi has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the main access routes to Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya Registered Civil Servants
Kenya has thus started to register all public officials to register biometrics to delete "ghost workers" from the government's pay lists.
Employees who do not register over the next two weeks would not pay more, a government notification.
The government suspects that thousands of people are still paid out of the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised in 2013 that corruption should be fought in the civil service.
When a check was made at the beginning of this year, it was established that at least 1 million ($700 000) a month were lost to payments for "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that wages continue to be paid to accounts when a person has died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear at the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data are received from biometric registrations, a government message has been notified.
All those who did not do so without credible apology from the payroll continued the communication.
"By doing so, it is essential to rationalize the public service by identifying the actual number of officials, and also eliminate the paylist to both levels of government," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of decentralisation and planning.
The scandal surrounding the art adviser Helge Achenbach will be discussed in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs to Berthold Albrecht, the son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are calling for damages of Achenbach and two of its companies involved in insolvency proceedings.
That was shared by a lawyer on Monday.
In the chart it says that Achenbach took part in the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and calculated Berthold Albrecht a higher purchase price than actually paid.
That also meant that the commission agreed was also higher.
Achenbach has bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings.
He was in the school for 44 years, of which 23 are the head of the school.
From that time, Manfred Richter knows many of Petershausener's and Kollbacher's times as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always due to the desire to see people in the student.
The Schneekoppe is the best known mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif of his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau / North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
Already at 14 he was interested in secondary school for the teacher's profession after four years of secondary school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their homes.
After a few months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagons.
That is how judges flew to the summit of Upper Franconia.
The teacher formation took place in Bamberg.
To this end, Manfred Richter had to run six miles per week, ten kilometres to the nearest railway station, the train to Bamberg, three kilometres across the city, and return to the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping opportunity in a red-cross home in Bamberg: Together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951 he established the second state examen after three years of teaching assistant.
Since Oberfranken had not taught him a free teacher, he went to Upper Bavaria and joined the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Miss room" was its first "temporary home" in the school.
In 1958, he moved to the school in 1958 alongside the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, in Kollbach, there were three classes and five classes in Petershausen.
From the school year 196/69, these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, primary school remained in the town.
In order to avoid a downgrade of the now smaller school, the then Rektor Georg Sigl after Karlsfeld changed, and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and thus, from September 1982, the children and their teachers were able to refer to today's building, which was extended to Judge retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the straightforward generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at the expense of the community, had also built a work room, during the enlargement of 1997, even though it was not eligible for funding in accordance with the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very debt-friendly," recalled judges.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a representative who replied to a unit of law about law and justice: "You should never forget love."
"There are two things to give to the children," says the 84 year-old.
And he had to learn that "this won't always succeed."
In any case, Judge action sometimes was unconventional.
When students are tested, they have not received any criminal work and have not been arrested.
At the expense of the congregation, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves and allowed the two parties to compete against each other, even if there should be a bullet.
For the benefit of the school, judges as Rector judges used a good relationship to the then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
He moved the non-partisan judge to retirement in 1996, at least as the last on the CSU list for the local councillor.
But judges were elected in place and joined the CSU.
180 Kilometers in Three Days
Hr4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists place in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scots.
When cyclists go on tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots, this is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of stopping impressions, who enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen, later offered a break at the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen.
The participants met at Bad Vilbel on Thursday in Bad Vilbel on Thursday under the motto "cycling and celebrate on new paths" and experienced a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was taken seriously: The cyclists took the first stage, the 60 km from Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of the mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was started with the bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the home company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring, were welcomed.
A lot of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and spirit: The rural women from Ranstcity and Nieder Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple, kennel, stream and cheese cake.
"Such cakes can only bake country wives," praised a participant in Aulendiebach, while he changed another bit.
Cold refreshments could be served in the beverage bar of the sports club Geiß-Nidda, where cold refreshments could be served.
The "Duo Bravo" kept visitors with familiar melodies from operettas and musicals and greeted them with enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful setting of the park was relaxing.
A Lord also enjoyed a head massage of his partner: "He has earned them, finally he has already fixed suspended bicycle chains again today."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: They were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the fountain and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Since the first hr4 cycling tour in 2004 as tour manager, Tobias Hagen has also had a lot of fun to do with the technique on the ground.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his staff and a radio device with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle stunt of the police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "even from Gießen or Fulda, Lauterbach, the Taunus, and even many cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants is slightly adapted to the accommodation capacities available.
In category I will be accommodated in hotels, in category II in class accommodation.
After a year and a half, the town had a good impression of the spa.
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!
After the arrival in Scots, the group was able to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were called up in idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park was given a nice festive atmosphere and of course you could have prepared goodies, such as flame cakes with well cooled feather white.
The visitors were welcomed by the Mayor of Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs as member of the board of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen.
The Three were visibly pleased with the "many businesses in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity of going out in the open air was used diligently in spite of the sporting activity on the bike.
Visitors increasingly mingle with the good spirits of the bikers.
On the second day, the stations of Birstein, Guardians and Bad Orb were on the agenda for the cyclists, including a concert with the Trenkwaldern.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, athletes met once again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government.
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on the basis of the suspicion of the "conspiracy against the government."
The police authorities made no immediate comment.
Among the arrest of 14 senior police officers, reports Elefriyet Daily News, who was arrested.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they were supposed to have established organized criminal organisation and the addition of telephone numbers.
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamic cleric's emulsion against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school.
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1st September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to the school.
There, he informed journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in any school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere in Ukraine.
We need to fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian grass-roots front, needs to fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, school head of the school in Slavjansk who visited Jazenjuks's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that the children will have a training that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is celebrated traditionally, with children wearing shirts, carrying balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud glory of the banking world, media management, and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And it has its own front experience.
Her career started at the global management consultancy Bain and Co., where she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of Pearsons.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned to a younger male colleague.
Her compensation reportedly amounted to £1 million.
Their political ranking, too, is sound.
It was recommended by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, to a more private knowledge in Whitehall: She became adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory of the Council.
Back in May, I described the President's task with a poisoned chalice.
It is not just that the BBC is a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The trust works in two directions: Inside, the first guard of the first guard in the BBC, but also the outside as a voice of public concern and concern, when things are going wrong.
This provides for an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires complete comprehensive reform.
But the leader who is coming forward would risk going to everything and to divide an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while it might be doing its job.
It is a difficult task.
And, as if that were not enough, there are also many who are interested in seeing the BBC fall apart - power, money, and status.
While the competition is approaching and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of the licence fees for the BBC is linked to special dangers.
For the modest sum of £145.50 per year, the British public is buying the world's biggest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: It says that it reaches 96% of all households and costs only 40 Pence a day.
And it seems that the BBC is rising upwards: 53% support them today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get messages today on my mobile phone and watch them later on on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and considerable institution.
It needs considerable chairman - I hope it has found it.
Perry from Texas says that belated tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a belated comment about the democratic regional prosecutor, which is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perrys's user who denied the previous one.
Just a tweet was sent by my account that was not authorized by me.
"I did not approve the tweet and I deleted it," said the later news.
Perry staff did not answer questions as soon as possible.
Although the tweets of Perrys's official account failed, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the former Tweet, a non-favorable picture of the municipal prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn up in April 2013 for drunkenness at the wheel.
Perry vetoed financial support for her office when she refused to resign, which led to a charge against Perry - who may be a candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet is: "I am not always drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level... but when I do, I put it to Governor Perry when he chased it."
I am the most hated democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the study of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads guilty and called the charge a political ploy.
His top class team of legal counsel, requested by the judge by the case, to reject the charge and argued that the law with which the Governor of the State's oldest governor was conducted in the history of the State of Texas is unheard of.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funding to the state's public integrity unit - located in Travis County, and determined in the case of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint on the part of a left watchdog group.
Perrys's official user account is often updated - and sometimes most famous.
After finishing a fifth at the election meetings in Iowa in 2012, Perry suggested that he would stop by sending a tweet of a photograph of himself to jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina!
Berkeley explains housing market again for "normal."
One of London's most prominent builders has pointed out that the housing market has returned to normal levels in the south-east of England.
Homes in the capital were hotter and the subject of huge price increases, which the Bank of England, owing to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, to set cap for mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and CEO of the high class construction company (Berkeley) said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013."
The property market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers crowded into the capital.
According to information from the registry office, the price of the urban area has risen by 18.5% last year, far more than the average rise in England and Wales as a whole.
At the end of April, at the end of April, the average selling price rose by about a fifth of last year and was £423,000 at the end of April.
But a stronger pound, however, has made property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months, some of which have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes, and political rhetoric about a possible "estate tax" before the general election in May.
The London Real Estate Agent warned in the past week that in the second half of the year, the mortgage market report for April, in which stricter lending regulations were presented, would result in lower market growth in the second half of the year, both at real estate sales and at prices.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage credit in July, which also indicates that the housing market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another Real Estate Agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in housing prices in London for 2015 to below 3%, on the basis of a weakening of domestic volatility.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has fallen year after year by one quarter, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, given that the amount of money due to appointments is more than $2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable, and as a result, sales of appointments have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - nearly a third more than at the peak of 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased by 40% annually to £280 million, which was a turnover of 18 percent to €1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday prior to the annual general meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley was expected to meet current market expectations during the current year.
The analysts unanimously value the annual pre-tax profit to 450 million £.
Berkeley shares were £23.96 in London in the afternoon.
Naked photos by Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet.
Jennifer Lawrence appeared at the 85th Oscarverleihung.
Naked photos of the Oscarprize winner, Jennifer Lawrence, were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "Master" list of images of another 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star "The Tribute of panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and blamed the hackers for "flagrant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The images originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were provided by a gap in Apple's online storage system, which includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Marie-Kate Olsen, Buzzfeed.
It is not certain that many of the pictures are genuine, although Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim against the Rest of the World" was also condemned to the hack on Twitter as well.
"To those of you who look at the photos that my husband and I have taken years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeons "iCarly" and "The" denied that the photos of her were images of her and tweetete "These so-called nude pictures of me are fake, people.
Let's fight at the beginning of the game.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photographs of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons" most acclaimed novel about love and the letter "J.
They were crushed, so they could be described in the best way, and they got slowly like a box that was kept in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman said that he was too serious, hard, hard to take, and perhaps somewhat scratchy.
And then shook him.
He knew a lot of scratch.
He was stubborn, as if they were in Igel.
The last victim of this bliss was a very nascent affair, which had been more promising to alleviate the lonely boredom of his life, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling beauty with unspeakable hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which even was more remote and rough than port repentance.
She had come to the south with an older escort, had inherited the Kevern for her aunt, and inherited a plot in a moist but heavenly valley with the appropriate name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leck, the baths were still spiders, neck screws had left their mark on all windows, they believed that they belonged to them, and the garden was guarded by weeds, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house out of a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the Author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on Longlis for Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern used to wear Ailinn, sitting on the broken decks on the high grass, and enjoying an unusually hot spring afternoon, both of which were buried in the centre of service, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, as the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer, to which his father was happy to listen to closed shutters
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Nothing was banned - nothing was forbidden.
It has been successfully rendered obsolete, as is the word obsolete.
What they never managed to do, like the people on books, managed what they never managed to do, and how the people on books chose to choose between the hang-case for millionaire memoir, cookery books and love novels, which they chose with music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern started to play an imaginary piano and headed in a coarse comic Serenade.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"It was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he explained her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That had always done his father to stop the letter J before coming out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
When you start a word with a J, without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It was not a very funny game at that time, and it was not very funny now.
He knew that was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard which one.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not banned directly.
The improvising was no longer modern.
It was only place for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure where they would end at the beginning of a melody.
So is the mind.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was musically pushed wisely.
Although he had been ten years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection.
But at least he did not have to declare Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At age, they probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Once again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that each element of that society was grateful to the principle of group expertise - grateful to those swallowed by fate.
People with African-Caribbean origin were well suited to the area of temperament and body construction for entertainment and sports, that is to say, sing and burned them.
People who originally were from the Indian subcontinent, as by nature, were blessed with electronic talent and were looked after by the task of ensuring that no family was left without a working service.
What was still left by the Polish community, it took care of the sewers, which was crushed by the Greeks.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly, than the WAR that had been accused of being accused of fire, out of fear that they would be indicted for fire, out of fear that the flames would eat them next, and of fear that they would eat them next, were in keeping with
Each according to his skills.
Since they only heard ballads, it was hard to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung could ever be demonised.
Music was the expression of love.
"Those are not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anybody, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceiving feeling of security.
Nothing was able to overcome the soundproofing of the huge cohesive leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why should your father have such love?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated to place two fingers on her presence.
She already thought that he was a bit curious.
"It seemed funny for him," he said instead.
She shook her head and locked her head.
There was nothing else to be seen around the world, as their undisguised rabid hair.
There was nothing he would have wanted to see.
"When you say it," I believe without conviction.
But that does not explain why you want me to do so.
She seemed to be honest.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet so directly do not.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
You hate?
Of course I hate you.
That is just the stupid song.
He could have said 'I love you', but it was too early to do so.
"Your thick ankles are precisely the reason why you are happy," he tried instead.
I am a little perverse here.
That was wrong.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because he, like his father, did not have the calming charm that was needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be Kevern, that is.
Despite its kind eyes to it.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose to their deckchair.
Holunderblossom wine, so, drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitation, she seemed to tremble, as Palmwedel did in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I feel afraid to you," she said,...
In addition to that, I am not.
She was sorry, both for the uneasiness of his words, as well as for the fear that she showed in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she that he would beat them?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was in essence as she was here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke here as it was there on the shore.
The same confusion of men, with even thicker skin and dripping after THE WHOLE WAR, who had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from Kneipe to Kneipe, always prepared to rise the hand against a woman who refused to or lost them.
Thick Head?
They would have shown a fat fist if they did not fit!
You've only cracked - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a antidote to the spurious love ballads from the console - they kneaded and beat them.
According to Kepler's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the crackle itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through their bodies.
He arose out of a deck-chair like an old man.
She also felt pale, but the usury of his sadness surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She saw him as he turned away - as a room on the upper floor looked at - a man, complaining of what he had summoned.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, even though some had raised some of their hands against them.
A man turned from her to bend, his back, defeated, defeated without fighting spirit - why was it a sight that it seemed good to know when she could not remember a single occasion at which she had already seen that much before today?
When they were once again alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at their feet.
A few years ahead of the events that had just been recorded, the ESME Nussbaum, a intelligent and enthusiastic young researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for the public mood, in a short lecture on the continued violence at the low and middle level in the very parts of the country in which the reduction, if not the abolition, were most likely to be expected in the face of the funds and energy invested in eradicating
"It has already done a lot, and much remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who fought a thousand wars and won the most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys where the sweet breath of human kindness was rarely felt between the hedges.
But some properties are proving to be inexorable.
The higher the tower it seems, the less the passion it continues to open up.
The people wept when listening to sentimental ballads, they are intoxicating themselves by stories about overblown difficulties and believing to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless, not only the history of rural communities as well as our urban fabric, but also evidence of the emergence of a new, insidious dispute at home, at work, on the streets, and even on the playing fields
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor, when he read the whole report.
I suggest that you read fewer novels.
ESME Nussbaum cut her head.
I also have to ask: Are you atheist?
"I think that I do not have to say," replied ESME Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, ESME invoked its right to privacy and denial.
Feminist?
Silence.
"I do not ask this," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I was against atheism, reading or feminism.
This is a job that is unprejudiced.
We are in favour of an unbiased free society.
However, some hypersensitivity, which is totally acceptable and praiseworthy, may occasionally distort what you have presented.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things, which you call "insidious" and "roh," could be interpreted by others as well as expressions of course, of course, of strength and vitality.
If you continue to go on what is going on, what IS IS, if it were to happen yesterday, if it were, is to take the country's vital power.
ESME Nussbaum looked at, while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED lettering repeated in Flamingorosa the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter-century or more.
Smile your neighbor, value your partner, listen to your partner, listen to ballet, visit Musicals, use your phone, tell you, tell you, listen to you, you agree, excuse yourself.
Speaking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to do," the ESME Nussbaum replied, when it was certain that its predecessor had spoken, "and I say nothing more than that we are not yet as effective as we are ourselves."
My concern is that, without a warning, we may find ourselves in the process of repeating the mistakes that were imposed only at THE WHOLE.
This time, however, it is not the other at which we leave our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with the hands.
In order to interpret it as an angel patient.
"You go too far," said he, "when you call actions as "errors," which our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you say that they have left out their "anger" and "distrust" to "others."
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past, as with the protection of the present, do not speak of "us" and "others."
There was no "we" and there was no "other."
It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.
"If we are honest with ourselves," ESME said that no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I am not sticking to anyone.
Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened, has been done.
That was what happened then.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we agree on that.
Just as no blame should be placed on them, no blame must be blamed if such eradication were appropriate and if there were a way to wipe them out.
But what is the point of the past, if we do not learn from it?
The past serves to ensure that we forget them.
If I may say something, let me say something.
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid coincide.
"I'll keep in mind their report," he said and dismissed them.
The next day, when she went to work, she was driven by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, was driven to the foot in a kind of "brutal rage."
There are cases of accidents.
Lesotho says that no coup d'état is planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho were trying to have a coup d'état planned for toppling the government, and said that they were opposed to policemen who were accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and told that the army of the country converted its headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after reporting threats of attacks.
Military spokesperson Major Ntoi said that there is no coup d'état, but the military is responding to the threat of "political fanatics," whose armed forces are faced by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the Defence Forces of Lesotho, after having received several intelligence reports that within the police, there were some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to wreak havoc," he said to Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that military action has made the impression of a coup.
"Even though no one claimed that the government was torn by force, all the reports agreed that the activities of the Defence Forces of Lesotho so far show signs of a coup d'état. "he said.
Speakers of the military of Lesotho reported on Sunday that the soldiers were lagging behind in their barracks and were calm in the capital.
In the meantime, the vice-premier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the governance while Thabanes lack.
Thabane said that he believed that he had become a target for his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, tension has been going on since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of the arguments in its unity government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, despite accusations.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month Tief
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point of the last 13 months, as it was closely monitored.
The final market value index of manufacturing (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after 51.8 in July.
There is an indication of 50 that has an expansion.
New orders went back, and factories experienced collapses at a time of rising tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will take place before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to expect a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the ECB's head, Mario Draghi, could provide further information later this week whether to consider quantitative easing for the eurozone, in line with those made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although a little growth is better than no growth, the slowing effects of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties for producers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, leading economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner, fell to the deepest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a sorcerer, as well as Italy's descent from a solid expansion to the stagnation.
Indications that growth in the key industry in Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands are no longer effective are also not reassuring,' said Mr Dobson.
The decline of industry is likely to fuel the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, at the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say about the purchase manager in the eurozone in the euro zone from August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone are obviously rather difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and the Ukraine - are widening uncertainty in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably leads to some contracts being delayed or even cancelled, especially large contracts.
He said that it would "more likely" that the ECB had to launch a kind of QE, "though we suspect that this will be limited."
The infernal year of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school.
Ten years ago, over 1.000 people from Chechen militias were taken hostage by a school in Beslan in southern Sudan.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day Martyrium that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death from the atrocities in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, in which 334 children, including 186 children, died, warned the heroic survivors last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united East and East in abhorrence, and surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death from the atrocities in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell is going to pursue them forever.
Their greatest hope?
The war that Ukraine is now searching for - and in the children they are dying - is now coming to an end.
The girl, who was photographed during the attempt, to climb up to the crumbling school sports hall.
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and well known when she only tried to use her underwear to climb back into the crumbling school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida, according to her mother Larissa, was now 40 years old.
Both were kept dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me that I am to run my life, but I could not," said Aida.
My legs were bloodless.
I stood up and climbed again to search for my mother.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a number of operations, she considered herself completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I am afraid that I have to work again again.
Some grenades are still in my knees.
Your goal is to become a dentist in order to help the people, as was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it has not broken me," she says.
"That happened to me, and that cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who have stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed of going together to the school.
"I do not want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I am thinking later of a family.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, even though the memory of every year becomes a little weaker.
I am glad that many people around the world are still reminded of our horrors, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, as I returned to the school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to ensuring that nothing happens again.
The boy who fled the ball thought that his mother was dead.
It was his first day of school (Russians went to school at 7 years of age) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year, he said: "Mama told me that I should go down when there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: 'Run'.
With fear that she could be dead, he fled, and he looked at a crying infant, took it up at hand, and fled by a ball.
His father, Vladimir, who left his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said: 'I could not save them'.
In fact, Tamara was left out outside and with a leg injury in the hospital, in turn, in the assumption that her son had died.
After their reunification, she said: "I wept for joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now released newspaper News of the World) in order to get the title of a barns" s Children's Champion by the then Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that in my memory will be pale.
I still know that I threw away all my toy guns directly after that.
However, now I can play with games of fire, and that is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid of going back to the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, whom I played in the courtyard, and who did not get out there.
We never say that they were killed or dead.
We say that they have remained in the sports hall.
I remember very well on my trip to London, especially at the toy store, where I was able to choose what I wanted, and to the ride in an above open car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me of it.
"I am sorry for all those who are suffering from Greueln," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
That is how I want to help.
I will one day go to the police and I hope that they take me next year at the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, you can imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers vividly her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London wept as I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her yourself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschsch and how they appealed to all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so readily shared our pain and supported us.
She said: 'I always think that this world has not improved over the last 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are children like ours.
I think that for many of the war is a part of the news that they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel all the horror.
And I cannot stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the last abominations.
I know that he does not like to remember that, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go into the sports hall and light there.
When he was small, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes turned to the sofa, the face of us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he was going to carry on with all his weapons and other military toys.
I cannot believe that I was so sure for some hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion, I looked at myself and saw the hell around me, with all the parts of the body.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could not have survived.
"I remember that I brought him back, "Damir," course run away, but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But it has been heard and it has gone away.
And that is how life goes on, unlike that of many others.
Mr Ilyin, 17
The boy, the terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the atrocities of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan survivors, Georgij Lyin, with his mother Fatima, after the siege of 2004, to the right a picture of Georgij today.
His bloodthirsty face was scarred by fear when he was running around his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a health care professional, had sold him for his first day of school before she rushed to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and thus my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
It was not entirely alone that a whole family of relatives were of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgii managed to survive.
The closer the date is, the more difficult it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it is long ago, I think it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days follow me forever.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Strong: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school this day; he said that he wanted to hug his teachers.
I knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden at home in the bookcase.
I understand that, but I also mean that the people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: 'It is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever find out the truth.
People always investigate such tragedies and never experience the truth.
Now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in the Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I cannot understand how that is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war.
Ten years are nothing at all of such pain.
We need dozens of years to remember a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it became better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid of each day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That is why I always go to the sports hall when 1 September approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old children's.
It is hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do so.
I do not feel myself as a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not try.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I am going to be heart surgery.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Mr Faniev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorists.
A miracle: Georgiy Faniev was caught during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and was sitting next to the bomb, which was at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It really is a wonder that he was not killed.
"We feel that it was as if it were yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret agent, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, it is nothing that I have left behind me.
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say that this is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that, but I cannot forget it.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - in the year afterwards - this was the first and only time that I went back to the sports hall.
I lost awareness.
I will never return again and ask me not to show you where I have sat in this famous image.
Survivor: Georgij Faniev today, with a photo of herself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop.
My pain is incredible and I am wearing it every day.
My friends know that I am not happy to think about it, and they never asked me about the school.
Physically it is good for me.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can now walk well.
But because of my health, I was not able to study at the FSB's secret service, which I wanted.
I have submitted my documents, I have also sent them in a medical way and they replied that it would not be possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary Institute.
I have been behind me for two years now.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
That is what children should not know, and they should not, of course, suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I am going to pay tribute to the celebrations.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It needs to be much more severe for him because he was there.
I waited at home on it and could not help.
I am grateful to God for being returned to me.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is hard to accept that if there is something so unfair.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he cannot take part because of his knee.
He has been operating several times, he can run, but he cannot sport.
I would say that it has overcome the horror at 50%, but we can never overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege, and that only increased my pain.
I have lost a lot of people who I knew well and who were expensive.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could do to me, but my heart wept around the thieves.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never got married.
It is hard to accept that life will continue, even if you do not want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I almost cannot believe it.
We used to be a friendly land, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are killed.
If only we could pick up all these rebels and throw them out - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, which was so much carried by a special force in safety
Rescued: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian Special Command Command (left).
It is now ten (right), and it is not reminiscent of the cruelties.
The world took the breath of 2004 when the Baby Aljona was born into the poor of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists left them, but their cruelty fell to their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister of Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, who was three years old, escaped, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since married again, and with his new wife Svetlana has a little girl that he mentioned after his lost daughter, Kristina.
Aljona, who is ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown to a smart and happy girl, neighbors.
"You are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and will spare them all the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos.
If you would like to have photos or videos under water, there is a range of devices to choose from.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point and shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are at $300.
I have recorded these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which are available at a price below 350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery is close.
Also place your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the watertight conditions of water.
And before you jump, check out what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are allowed only for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our Purchasing Manager and the reviews of digital cameras for conventional and watertight models.
Take multiple photos - because many are not closing.
Point and Shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the correct image setting is a matter of luck.
So do a lot of pictures.
If your camera has a row mode with which a series of shots are made with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay near the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse the further you remove yourself from the surface.
Thus, when possible, you will remain close to the surface if you are taking pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
Thus you can also add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.

Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an advisory agent, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease, as well as the anguish of treatment.
Among its patients, his wife remembers a MI6 staff, who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and diseases, while the treated are mostly preoccupied with something else: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose suffering started.
"I did not feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulties to call me.
While he fought with the flu symptoms, he noticed that he made a impatience of his wife Juliet.
"I want everything as soon as possible," he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson was feeling most unlikely and worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an x-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago, he was going to ski in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray inspection was there.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks chest hair, which is the skin's lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers contract lung cancer, not all lung cancer were previously smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber, which was once considered to be "the "wonder," but it has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, Mesothelioma is a disease that can ignore how easy it is.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960" s, when industry voluntarily undertook to stop using it.
Also where they have been used, only people in certain sectors have been working directly with the material - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters, and shipyard workers.
As an industrial hazardous material from another time, it hardly seems to be worrying today.
But that complacency is misguided.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the peak of a Mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.
Annual numbers of mesotheliomial cases since 1980 and prospective future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are seeing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999, when all types of asbestos were banned), it is that a mesothelioma is developing only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not confined to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and still is, in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And that is why Mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no shelter.
The buildings of Parliament are contaminated by asbestos.
The hospitals, in which we are supposed to be healthy, have already been identified as the source of this lethal carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber either.
Indeed, it was hard to imagine where it might have been in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years on my training," wrote he.
All - students, nurses, doctors and carers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many people are going to suffer the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer that question at least in part.
"Of the four physicians who were trained at Guy's hospital, who suffered from Mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I'm the last one who still lives."
How many of us are going to develop?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty per cent of all mesothelioma patients are dying within eight months of the diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: 'How many will we develop?'
Britain's leading expert, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that when the epidemic of asbestos in the UK is expected to end in 2050 and 2050, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen.
Most of them do not yet know that they are going to die.

A quick look at the files of the courts, to which the parties concerned often object to the demands for compensation, shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioms is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted that Janice Allen was negligent in carrying out asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing division at two locations - one of them of the flagship store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started to work at M & S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this cause," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I did not even know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance but a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestos form," a description of the fibre structure, which makes the fabric resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos in buildings.
It has been used for roof tiles, floor tiles, pipe isolations, boilers, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is nevertheless seen by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with potential for death.
However, it is more dangerous than the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain used to be the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts assume that "there is a clear but indirect indication that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomrats."
A staff member of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy in the flag store at Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not have been seen as a typical Mesothian victim, but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their history is by no means unusual.
It has produced a study by those affected, which states that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomes, without a known suspension through work or in the home, was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks as if no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows how people could well have been exposed to the substance even in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service powers and piping behind the parliamentary offices of Parliament were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be raised by something as harmless as "powerful air movements".
MEPs are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Employment Service insisted that the Western Minster Palace had received a "clean health certificate," it is now undisputed that one billion pounds need to be spent over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and after the general elections, MEPs will be meeting in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green benches at Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective regulations."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
All that can be done is waiting.
A person who has never been able to determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to the asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital, asbestos actions have been positively determined," said he, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places to which one has worked, and to remember the data.
What he has yet to remember is the day at the beginning of December 2009, at which he was given a kind of fever.
He was 45, and conducted surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills frost.
It suddenly came.
I felt terrible.
I thought that it would no longer be possible to drive the trip home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest, the skin, was stirring around its lungs.
Like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He did not go to work a month.
Strange doctors made x-rays of his chest and used Pleurakathether to take the liquid out of the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after physical activity and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient came with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not do so with his own case.
After all, his patient was older for several decades and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbotts deteriorated and his family doctor brought CT scans and X-ray images to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott was feeling sick for the first time, a sensor equipped with a camera was introduced to the cave between the ripper and the chest.
I am an optimist.
I usually just go on," he says.
To be honest, I did not have so many concerns.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "You told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, who advised him to take a lawyer.
First of all, he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he said.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now contracting.
Mesothelioma is now hitting younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with ascetic solids in hospitals were under the Earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many people who changed pedestrians from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely to be in contact with toxic substances.
It is apparent that, several decades after the war, hospitals may have saved patients to patients.
It is still being removed today.
Students turned off their Bunsenbrenners on Asbestmats.
And it is not only a matter of hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries, and town halls because of its fabulous insulating and flame-retarding properties.
We also have schools.
In fact, many people have had the first contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemicals, students have turned their bakers to asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now often mentioned on websites.
Meanwhile, so innocent items contain asbestos in our homes, such as floor tiles or scales.
"It is a industrialist that is included in large parts of our homes," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact, which was a woman affected, was the demolition of a horseshoe in the 1970s.
So you can adjust how you rip your garden shed.
The effects of diagnosis and knowledge that the disease is incurable is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I will not experience another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change in perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients, he remembers how he was overwhelmed by all the information he had to cope with.
"It was very difficult to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long I've got?"
And there were about 12 months to come.
I remember that I thought "Well, I will not see another Christmas.
That was then.'
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our vitality mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most of the cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is the smallest of fibres.
When the asbestos is blown up and the fibres are inhaled, they can be set in the chest, around the skin, around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the chest and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem is caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibres," says Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac thorax doctor who changed to the guy's hospital in 2001.
The very hospital, of which Andrew Lawson claims that it has been exposed to asbestos, is now ironic, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others, who probably also were exposed to the asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the aspids reach the lung tissue, Treasure says that they are pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From the very beginning it is invasiv.
The usual options for other cancers do not work well at mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is highly controversial.
Some say that it is worth trying.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut the chest," he says.
You are not getting around with the knife.
Meanwhile, cancer "does not speak very well at chemotherapy," which shows "effect," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end they are all dying.
Fortunately, some patients actually live a lot longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and counselling office.
"hello, cancer centre," he presented herself with calls of happy marriage.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott was offered six chemotherapy cycles, which lasted four months and are expected to be extended by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed "to make things a little more positive."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, the heart of Thorax specialist, on the Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to refer, I just called and got an appointment," Graham to.
A normal patient would have to receive a bank transfer and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is critical to mesothelioma patients in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But when these treatments eventually fail, many people are facing other financial concerns - the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan by Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s has changed that one recognized that a very small burden was also a health risk.
And this is where the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally placed their case on their case, but it was not what Morgan calls "full compensation," because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asthma contact on Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, a spokesman of the Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990" s.
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma patients who are looking for compensation, which are a huge problem, the death of a company or a job, decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plainers.
This year, in response, there has been clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliom to claim compensation, even if its former employers are no longer able to find them.
The law has set up a £350 million out of the insurance industry for all who were diagnosed after July 2012, could have a contact, but could not sue.
In these cases, the plaintiff receives 80% of what a court could have had in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 £.
About 300 successful applications for the programme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many Mesotheliom, thinks that 350 million £was a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal between insurers for insurers," he says, and points out that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time was not passed away and Mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and normally sue them.
Mike Pening, the working and pension minister, also admitted that the law was not perfect.
But both Pening and Morgan said that rapid action is required every day in the face of seven death victims.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Law in December of last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After its initial consultation, Lang Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple-therapy with which Lang Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This is, of course, the most important thing," says Abbott.
This is always the case for patients.
There is something that allows you to continue.
If you give up, you will get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott joined the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last one of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Replica cans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I have just been 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That is vital to life.
Once again, Abbott has undergone six chemotherapy cycles.
Now, no trace of tumors is more visible.
But the process is physically and mentally demanding.
They need to think about practical things - the money, when I am no longer, for example, or my wife to show how the disaster setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
They need to look to the future.
As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents that is hard," says he.
It is hard to know what to say and how much is to be said.
When I received my first diagnosis, I said that I had a disease with which I would not be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and undisturbed.
They told their friends and we soon got very many calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She did not say much.
Such talks are something that will have to permeate all cancer patients.
But for Mesotheliomill, such talks are not crossed by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings grim security (as is the end of Stephen Jay Gould's end).

China denies Hong Kong law to government elections, protesters swear retaliation.
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reform, the Chinese Parliament decided against nominating candidates to the elections in 2017 by Hong Kong's electorate.
This action is likely to drive the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists are leading the planning and mobilization within a matter of hours after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress fundamentally allows the Communist leaders to reject all the candidates not consulted.
"This does not come unexpectedly, but it makes us angry," said legal experts Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing had promised.
It is the inhabitants of Hong Kong who have been lied.
It is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In its defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice Secretary of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations to the Hong Kong government elections would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain gave back control of Hong Kong, Beijing promised to let the residents elect the government in 2017.
China's leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, because there is direct suffrage to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that China's leaders retain the process by means of a closely controlled nominating committee controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates are to be admitted "with love for the land and love of Hong Kong."
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular protests in Hong Kong have been held for several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers are threatened to patrol the financial district, is on record if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, within a matter of hours, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that they planned for protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide information, which seemed to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers reported that the movement "the occupation of the central area" was only considered as a last resort, an action that should only take place if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and are not different.
We are sorry to have to say that all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for some days, and security measures, including police forces and barricades, were considered on Sunday in front of the government building.
The riots are reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The entry of people from the mainland reinforces competition for products and services.
Moreover, there is a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under rising pressure in Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central Movement, as they are endangering the business operation - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protests that they are talking about could do great economic harm, depending on how many they are involved, and how long they continue," said legal expert, Regine Ip, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We do not want to stir fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media recently reported recently about democracy activists in Hong Kong, a subversive agent controlled by Western powers.
This summer, organized activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights, to which 78,000 were attending - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of them participated in one of the greatest democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school leaving balls in the United States is now transferred to the universities, where Freshmen appearances with the private aircraft are offered.
We are happy to be able to react to this demand and offer Britain's first luxury travel service to students of today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transportation prices such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten, or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also suggested that the service had a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to steal their belongings through the land in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A corporate spokesperson said that no new bookings were made as the service had just been introduced, but it added that "students would book the service over the next weeks."
The company also announced that it would expect a market for this offer despite the tuition fees of £9,000 per year.
Students today are different in their expectations and demands by students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Student Alliance, however, criticized the service as being exaggerated.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems totally separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are facing a crisis of living costs, because the available financial assistance in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep pace with the sharply rising bills for the simplest bases of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds to spend thousands of pounds on something like the arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize race and police behaviour after Ferguson.
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo..
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands high, not shooting," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger, Miriam Zoila, noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators rely on race to address reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, while tensions in the Middle East rose and were respected throughout the country, Perez saw that white women's responses turned to 100% on the race.
In comparison with the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism are not just about the oppression of women "relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant important change.
"I do not think that in feminism there are many people who are talking about the white," said it.
People felt compelled to say something about the events.
It is typical of the crisis in which we are located and because the situation in Ferguson is such that they have to express them.
For English professor KAlgoritha Mitchell of the Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems that are exposed to black American women every day, which are not considered to be "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish a little bit on Facebook about me and my partners, and I get 150 Likes everywhere," said Mitchell.
Silence is deafening when I say something about it, just as colour is in its own country under siege.
"How can women be sure to talk openly about a relationship, but not about public safety?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the topics; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now link racial and sex to feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the history in order to justify the lynching.
At the point where there was a split between white and black women, at the point where white women voters, such as Susan B. Anthony, analysed the country in the late years of the nineteenth century and established that the fight for the election could only be successful for one group: Women or blacks.
"They met to choose to vote in favour of female suffrage, and the right to vote for black," said Hattery.
When you look at such matters, you are conscious of why coloured women do not trust white women.
We have not done our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to be organized against the lynch of the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was established almost 40 years after the original request for help of the sides of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists were playing with the problems that black women have fought for generations for generations.
"It would not be great if the activists, who had such traditional feminist platforms, had the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to conception," Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation, who built their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means, now try to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Stone went two weeks after shooting Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian columnist in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different, yet parallel reason to understand one of the body's inherent danger - and opinions on race, which are markedly different in public opinion polls - will lead to change," Steiner wrote.
Although Stun is for a rather intersectional feminism, while racial issues and gender issues are mentioned, some of their comments about racism in America are puzzled.
Christina Sommer, researcher on the American Enterprise Institute and the author of "Who stole Feminism," said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters."
There are now hundreds of specific programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for young people.
But, when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Stone.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that presses into the main focus of mainstream feminist.
After the US border police took up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform also comes back to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chairman of we Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the subject, as one of the essential women's questions, it should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of the working visa goes to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate across the women's organisations," said she.
"Pig-house" in Ipswich stands for sale.
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate brokers when it became apparent that it showed a large pig that it had made in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and will be offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig that had its head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig on the photo was the owner of the owner.
"The photo was published erroneously and has now been removed," said one speaker of the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former collecting house as a "unique one-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The house sales caused interest in the social media, as some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lottowin.
Harvey is a Lottoplayer of Harvey this month.
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth will take place, with a happy winner, who gets almost 1.1 million dollars from the lottery on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey, for the second time in five years, moved the jackpot in the draw of the first division, to 1 million dollars in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner will have to come back.
The shopkeeper Steve Forward said that profit care for talk in the small city in the southwest of Perth.
The city talks about nothing else, and all are quite excited.
We thought that such a win could happen.
Eight Winners celebrated last month profits in the first division, a fitting conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a married couple from Belmont had only a few weeks earlier achieved the mega-win of $7.5 million.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said that profit allows them to travel globally and purchase a new house.
The millionaire of Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the gladiatorial arena.
Not only the gladiators were standing deep in the Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Roman day in the park.
However, the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday, which defaulted on the rain and the autumn and were completely enthused by the historical spectacle.
There was a colourful variety of representations, performances, plays, exhibits, information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the naval force of the gladiatorial school "Amor Mortis," which used any period of rain to demonstrate its robust combat art in the Arena, which was prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presentator.
First of all, the "provocators" were at the right arm in the series with rectangular blade and a short tail on the left leg and arm track.
They were followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short ash, and litter, as well as iron gladiator helmets, ball seats and armguard.
Particularly impressive was the performance of the "RETIARIUS," who joined the "SECUTOR," the "RETIARIUS," who entered the "SECUTOR" and recently pushed the Burschen to the ground.
There you can see that there are a lot of metal lining up, that the reeds and the limbs have floated through the arena, that a fear and brace could be about the health of the gladiators.
But the impressive "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and experience the culture of the Roman times," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the organizer "Friends of the Roman Channel," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park became an "Oppidum Roman," a Roman city, as Vizebürgermeister Claus Wehage said in his greeting word.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also Roman culture and numerous buildings that we admire still today.
Remains of this were also on the Roman day, about "aqueducous marble" of the eleven metre-long Roman canal bridge, which once stood at the end of the ventilation.
The Frontinus company once confronted the water and energy supply once and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time."
This also confirms the degree of degree of degree of appreciation of Ralph Heiliger of the "Engineering Team Zwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans, such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894, as well as bricks from the original hypocrites, hot air conditioning, which once used to be the Roman villa.
The footprints, which were left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps, were also impressive before burning them.
In 2011, the Office for Soil History had dug the remains of a Roman villa in the Industrial Park Nord in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building have been found with a darre to dry grain and lambs.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, a farm, which was explained by the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD.
On the other hand, the children also worked with the Roman windmill, similar to today's Mühlspiel, who once wrote to Roman students with their names of metal on wax boards.
At the stand of the Roman thermal baths Zülpich, the children were allowed to create mosaics at the stand of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach Glasmosaiken, and at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim used a heavy wheel-mill out of stone to grind the flour for a pouch or a cereal.
With the original Roman journeys made by two cold flowers, visitors drove through the park and came here at the impressive status of the Municipal Gymnasiums, which presented the results of their "Roman-project weeks."
With a Roman week from the 13th to the 21st September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be involved in the Roman year 2014, which is to be remembered for the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations, the Wachtberger Wander Association, the Club and the Oberbachem, thematic hikes, lecture, cooking evenings, guided tours for school classes, will be remembered by the Roman past of the history of the Roman past.
For example, a Roman legionnaire from his work will tell him about his work on the Wachtberg, present plants as live monuments from the Roman period, and taught lessons in terms of international understanding between a group Wachtberger "Germanen," who was assigned to the Romans.
The Adendorfer primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous traces that are often visible to the Romans in Wachtberg are to be re-discovered by the Romans.
A small presentation at the Wachtberger Rathaus will remind you of the discovery of the kingdom of Matlon in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is affecting West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to West Africa's economy.
The crop rotates on the fields, the mines are deserted and the markets are orphaned - the virus has placed the region hard.
Some international companies are also running away from distance.
"Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," lies the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
The market only comes to who wants to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus.
Recently, the health authorities said that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
In total, over 1500 people, thousands of others, have already died.
Foreign companies draw employees from
Firms operate everywhere in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies, such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal, are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer able to fly to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers also react: Few merchants still leave their home cities in order to recover supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, who are in quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for exports, are being wiped out in the fields.
Farmers dare not leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is Low
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The people thus feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: Food is scarce.
On the markets, stocks of staple foods such as rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the highly dependent region of the region is threatened by an image - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies have long avoided the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank. Iris.
It is critical how far and how long the virus continues to spread.
Investors can feel that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.
The disease also affects the strained state budgets of the Member States.
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the Member States.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets are greatly strained by the high levels of spending on the health care system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to bail out the health systems of the countries in question at $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are also felt in Nigeria, where few Ebola cases have so far been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region of the southern Niger delta has not yet been affected.
Yet, however, many people already remain at home because of fear of contagion.
Reservations also go back to hotels.
To Protect Your 50th Anniversary
The Stiftung "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
Preparations for the 50-year foundation are running at the Schützenverein Tannenwald, which take place from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday, September 12th, a great night of entertainment with the group "Dorfrocker."
On Saturday, the big villain will be at 6 pm.
After that, in the big marquee of the mood evening, the mood evening is with the "Stoapfälzer Vorbuam."
Blaskapelle cares for the music.
Highlights on the Sunday are the feast of the night and the 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big feast at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon, the price distribution of the Federal and Gauge is also.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festivites with their Dirndln.
Festkapelle is the brass band of Berngau.
The patronage was taken over by mayors Wolfgang Wild and Undersecretary Albert Füracker.
The original designation "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau," dates back to 1907 when the association was founded on March 21 for "social entertainment by means of training in room for room in the room."
The Nazi regime had initiated the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men had found themselves, who, on 30 April in Gasthaus Lukas, were invited to the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald," Berngau.
Charles March and Adolf Ried led the club as a battalion by a difficult start time, in which it was mainly a matter of finding a venue and installing the shooting range.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started at the "Leininger" inn with two teams in the lap competitions.
In the following years, the sports companies, which now have been organized into seven teams, have been established in all classes to the 1st Gauleague.
The club records purged each year and the magical limit of 380 rings were reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the power of the active shooter has increased, the number of members has also been positively developed.
After the association "Leininger" no longer meets the demands of a modern society, the then Board of Management, under the leadership of Johann Rinn, has decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988, the parish priest for the new trenches granted the church blessing to the new trenches.
One of the great highlights of the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gauguin, coupled with the solemn consecration of the new shooter in July 1991.
On the 23rd and 24th of April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a bad group was established.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and the association as a whole was the direction of the Bavarian Böllertreffen in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association last year have modernised the rooms and shooting at Berngauer Hof, thus contributing to the state of the art of technology.
Eleven teams in lap competitions
It is also possible to see the sporting achievements of the association.
In total, eleven teams are currently participating in the lap competitions: Six air guns, an airgun team, a sports pistol KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin cellar man has been going up to the top league of the league.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml was opened by the Gauleague Nord to the Gauoberleague.
In addition to the shooting range, there are events such as Bocking, Carnival, Königsball, Vereina and the Christmas party.
With them they are also at the festivals in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffered an accident when he returned to the race track.
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went on to the wall for the second time, after his right hand stretched out into the round of 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car to the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that his 14 team was disappointed, but they now concentrate on the race this weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We are going to Richmond and we hope that we will be able to do better there.
Stewart already went to a wall after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to get the right side of his car repaired.
"I'm listening to a good result today," said Johnston, who added: "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewarts was charged with the tractor and the team had packed the team and was ready for departure.
Stewart was the first to have won the NASCAR Sprint Cup, after his car hit another driver at an ash race in the north of the New York State and killed him.
He decided to return this week and won either in Atlanta or during the next race in Richmond in order to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to work, while an investigation into the tragic incident leading to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. was investigated during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities reported on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue at least for two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken on whether Stewart will have to reckon with charges.
The third champion was greeted with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start to the 12th position, Stewart was soon after in the first 10 and lay temporarily on place four.
After a reboot in round 122, bushs fell into trouble.
Car with No. 18 outside the control after the curve 2 and collided with Stewart, where both cars went to the Wall.
Stewart went on, but he fell to place 21.
The Lessons of Dancing Dogs
Just try it: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma, and Director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to contributors.
Just like many other clubs, you can also create jazz groups on the TV of all day classes at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have been greatly decimated.
Now more young talent is being sought for a sport that is healthy and a lot of fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, a former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation, there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve year olds, six of whom are in the 12-15-year group," says the 20-year old.
With more athletes the whole thing would make much more fun, "one could dance other choreographies," she says.
Anyone who wants to dance can take a dance sports at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, on Thursdays between 17 and 18 or on Fridays between 17 and 18.30.
"Training begins regularly with a warming programme," says the trainee.
After that, various choreographies will be performed.
Jazz dance has the characteristic that there are no predefined shapes and thus is open to many styles.
Elements from folklore, from classical music to sport and acrobatics, are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, sociability is not too short.
"We are also eating, you have a look at dance films and we have stayed in the dance room as well," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a wonderful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you wish to have a look at who you are looking for, you can also have a look at one of the other special offers on the TV.
Children and young people can always take lessons in lessons in the areas of Kindertanz/Jazztanz, Bambini, Ballet, video clip and hip-hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult pairs are welcome to the dance nights on Monday and Wednesday.
Whoever wants to have a pleasure on Discofox, Langling Walzer, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, may stop by and participate.
Protesting Bulgarian Prisoner of Nations
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest outside the Department of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Even higher salaries are on a list of receivables that are to be discussed with the Interim Justice Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour strata.
Despite the meeting between the union's union representatives and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached.
The negotiations are continuing, the Director-General for the implementation of sanctions, Rosen Zhelyazkov agreed to BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union's union association.
Ukrainian Army has abandoned airport by Luhansk
In eastern Ukraine, prorussian fighters continue to advance on the march.
After hard battles in which Russian battalions are supposed to have been involved, the Ukrainian army, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk.
The army also indicated that seven soldiers were killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously already drawn human rights consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes to the top army leadership, without mentioning the details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot aircraft.
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists after their own representation have fired a combat aircraft and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in the region of Donetsk, according to the insurgents on Monday Russian agencies.
Ships of Coastguard
The insurgents also, for the first time in the Aegean sea, claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian coast guard.
Ukrainian border guards confirmed that two of its vessels were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
While seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev said to the station 112.uk.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the event.
The separatists also reported that several villages in the area of Donetsk had been brought under their control.
Diplomacy in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, there should also be a envoy to the separatists from eastern Ukraine.
In the run-up, all of the actors took advantage of their appearances on the public announcement of their claim.
NATO does not want agreements with Russia
NATO is not going to break its agreement with Russia by the planned stationings in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is following the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, blamed Russia of "a flagrant breach of the agreement."
"Today, we have to face reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
Documents and opinions from the Russian side show that they regard us as opponents.
Stepping up NATO
Rasmussen also announced that he would want to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have a more visible NATO presence in the East as long as that is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow on New Gas Talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks on the settlement of their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for Saturday, the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It will wait for a decision by the European Union, whether it is also a representative on the talks.
Because of the dispute about the price of gas, Ukraine has been receiving no fuel from Russia for weeks.
Finally, the Commissioner for Energy had communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also stop the supply of gas to Europe.
Europe accounts for a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, of which a large part flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks of power: Toll will be "very clear."
Now, once again, the Chancellor has made it clear.
However, a free letter to all the complicated details is not.
Persistent concerns from the CDU about the toll on cars have visibly brought the CSU to an end.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken of a power word for the introduction of a car toll after persistent opposition from her CDU.
"To make it very clear: It is in the coalition agreement, and it will be coming," the leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU" boards in Berlin.
For the time being, Merkel has not stuck to a detailed model.
In the black-red government program, are called "certain parameters."
Bundestraffic minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and continues to work now."
However, the NRW CDU CDU insists on its "no" toll on all roads, however.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) would be constructive in the debate on a draft legislation.
Beyond the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other ways to enable more private capital to invest in infrastructure, including, for example, broadband.
As Schäuble had left a "mirror" report on Sunday, his house tested its own concept to compensate highway investors with tolls - after the election in 2017.
CSU Chairman Horst Seehofer then warned that a cabinet should develop tolls against the minister responsible.
The CDU Federal Republic, Armin Laschet, reaffirmed its objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all of the circular and federal roads were to be seized," said the German Federal Court of CDU.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that it will discuss the matter again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU state associations of Baden-Württemberg and the Rhineland Palatinate.
The background is concerns that a toll affects small border traffic with neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had been demanding criticism from members of the CDU coalition because of the criticism levelled at the CDU.
The Left sees the plans as a failure in the light of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said Party Chairman Bernd Riexinger of the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"Dobrindt wants to introduce a duty of vignetting on all German roads that are to start in 2016."
Under the coalition agreement, however, domestic car owners should not be allowed to bear an additional burden.
That is why they are supposed to receive a full compensation for tolls via the motor vehicle tax.
The model should not, however, penalise foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often wrongly diagnosed
A britin says that she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers almost lived her entire youth in the belief that she had only lived for a few years after she had been diagnosed with another illness.
She actually suffered from the Charcot Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK informed that misdiagnoses are a common problem for people with CMT, because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor problems, such as muscle weakness, an unsafe cycle and curved toes.
The disease is incurable and progressive, and it means that the symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers 13 was, she believed that she was in a graveyard of peace (IAs) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought that she was sitting in a wheelchair before she was 18 and was dying before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same thing as the others.
I constantly fell and everything lasted longer.
I could never go with the other children, or skateboard are driving and were often going to go to school because of my kind and it was chased.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations, after several operations, after several operations, to relieve their Achilles and the involvement of their feet, they looked at their health records when their doctor had left the room and read that they were suffering from IAs.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I did not tell anyone, but I went home, sought after the disease in the library and wrote to the IAs Society," she said.
When I was given my answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and slowly all my skills would lose all my skills.
I made all this alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she became 17, she became aware that her skills had not been so much removed as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood, hugging me and saying, "My love, I do not think that you're already in a wheelchair."
I believe that you have something that is a little less in terms of life.
After some genetic tests, it was detected by its CMT.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt as if I was a winning partner," she said.
Charity CMT UK started a CMT-Awareness Month to alert this illness.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working since the closing of former troop forces as firefighters.
For almost ten years, the former troop location in Münsingen has not been fired.
Nevertheless, lethal ammunition is still emerging at the heart of the biosphere of Swabian Alb.
The shells are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown on the ground.
A deafening bang resonates with the detonations beyond the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the command of Münsingen, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6500 hectares are the core of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is opened to 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on businessmen in the Washington region is rising with economic recovery.
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
Public and local taxes on companies in the country grew slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, a newly published study was launched last week, and firms in the Washington region were no exception.
Companies in the area of District, Maryland, and Virginia paid $27.6 billion in government and local authorities in 2013, a 3.8% increase from 2012 to the revenue of $26.6 billion.
The corporate and local tax burden on companies increased by 4.3% last year, to $671 billion, relative to 3.9% a year, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes rose more sharply than local levies, at 4.3%, according to the study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for National Taxation, a fiscal policy.
More than half of the District's tax revenues, 56%, are sourced from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's income comes from companies.
Virginia has 28 percent of the lowest tax revenue from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is based on a recovery in the property values of corporations, telling the researchers, what to increase real estate taxes by 3.7% this year after the three consecutive years with rates of growth of less than 1%.
While a large proportion of these gains came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process also seems to be hitting the Washington region.
Companies in the district, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in government and local real estate tax last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a rise of 4.2% over a year.
But the seeming recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes amount to little more than a fifth of companies in tax terms.
Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their public and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, the following is as follows: A large part of the real estate, especially in the fiscal zone around the D.C, is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay for housing taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is thus forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be entirely offset by the recovery of the property market.
Corporate income also seems to recover, as the data is.
Companies in the region reported income taxes to state organisations from $2.3 billion to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland recorded $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not rise evenly in all three places.
The entry rate in the District was at 4.3% of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported an underaverage tax burden of 4.1%.
Virginia, at 6% in all three areas of office, has the very least corporate income tax (in which all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8,25 percent and 9.975% in the district.
A similar study by the United States Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower government and local taxes are required, and there is a better balance of tax than in Maryland.
In the study, the District was not investigated.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5% next year.
If the country continues to achieve its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income by 2017 to 3%.
In the meantime, small businesses seem to be doing better in the area of Washington, and they thus pay more government and local taxes, so the most recent study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure in which most small enterprises are organized - in the district, Maryland, and Virginia grew 20% last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate than corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in the general government tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014, compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the area of Washington may lag behind if the federal government's spending cut has an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German Beer for Guangzhou.
Hops and malt - a popular combination in China.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's twin city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - is the urgent desire of the officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said the Deputy Secretary of Congress of South China, Li Yiwei, this week when he visited a SPD delegation in his city.
Time and again, the functioning of the ruling Communist Party has returned to this concern of the twelve-million metropolis during the conversation.
Guangzhou, also known as the canton, is one of the richest cities in China.
That is why people also have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Austrian SPD Chairman, Thorsten Schäfer Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, said to the host that he would be hearing about a potential partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it does not need much: Good water, grain and joie de vivre," added he at lunch with the party top in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already Mr Li, he flattened the host.
As a result, the function of Guangzhou was found by Schäfer Gümbel - however, with a red wine that was served to the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice party chef Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but removed in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," local politician demonstrated.
"Commerce between our two cities continues to grow."
At the moment, travellers would have to take the detour over Changsha in the province of Hunan.
Also the administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is hoping for the flight connections.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"It is a very good idea," said Schäfer Gümbel - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany.
Well-maintained partnership
The official Vice President of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to attend a partner meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but he was not yet in this function.
He first came to office later this year after his predecessor had been promoted to office for corruption charges.
The local party leader, Wan Qinglian, also had to go.
The action taken against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration imposed by Governor Xi Jinping's degree.
The new leader Li Yiwei worked for an American company outside his party career, which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before he took office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top designer in Fujian, where he built a large factory.
Frankfurt is officially more than a dozen town twinning.
It is one of those who are being cared for by both parties, for example by means of a student exchange.
The 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated last year.
The South China metropolis on the Pearl River, with its economic strength, is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse.
Over the next year, Li wants to reach a gross domestic product of €250 billion, reported Li.
The family of Joan Rivers "expresses the thumb."
Joan Rivers was unconscious since she came to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter today became hopeful that the 81 year-old will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
All of us press all the thumbs.
According to her mother, on Thursday, after an emergency, at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, was delivered to the Mount Sinai hospital.
Doctors are deliberately treating them and observing until they are more satisfied that they are still described as "serious."
The reactions came from many quarters, even in the form of an overwhelming online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In the future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners who are now in trade.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners are given on 1 September on a label on which the buyer can see at a glance key information such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, the pollutant category "Euro 6" will have stricter levels of nitric oxide.
In addition, there is more money for scaffolds: They receive a uniform minimum wage of EUR 10.25.
Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion $.
Amazon confirmed just now what information had been reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a lot of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be taken over, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google for a $100 billion billion was agreed, and cooperation also appeared of course.
Twitch, which was founded three years ago as justin.tv, started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their Bravouritems in games, a "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
"let's play," a video genre in which the better-known (mostly) plays a painting of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is precisely that when you want to describe Twitch, YouTube is often called, so the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was recorded a little bored, a textbook example of an established engineering company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a puzzle why the deal with YouTube failed to materialise, because the company reported that it was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us to get there faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs, such as me, who say that they prefer to sport sports, it is hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others when playing, rather than taking the control console.
It is one thing to look at a friend at 3 in the morning, while she's easy and a little different to see how he was shooting at the start of the day.
All these games could be viewed now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are now ego games, so the audience can be a good recipe for headaches without control over the eye.
I admit that the fast-track runs in which the Roger Banners of our electronics era complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as it is not a game or human virtuoso, his Twitch-channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics already know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated in Amazon Instant Video, as YouTube Twitch just could swallow.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: Thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers.
As the Chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both to the future of the gaming," and the medium shows no signs of contraction, even at night - as a spectator sport.
On the Sunday there was a lot going on at the "Hüpfburg" at Burggarten.
The concept of the organizer was right.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday night, it is estimated that there were 1200 music fans at the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, admission had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt of light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name of Amula.
The open air in the salt refiner is intended to radiate the brightness of the day and night through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes anyway, anyway.
That was already early Saturday morning when the first visitors started to open air.
A feast for all generations was promised by the organizers.
They have succeeded in doing so.
Around the castle grounds there were swarms, as well as guests from the nearest and other surroundings.
They were watching the first live performances, wippies with a foot in the beat, cool drinks - in short, pure relaxation and pleasure were announced.
And that across generations.
While the white sand on the covered white sand was lying on the beach bar, others ventured into a quarter of wine in the wine cellar, where the young children raged on the hip, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
In the truest sense of the word, however, the volunteers at Kinderschminken had to do all they could, in order to become an Andorian and create imaginative creations in the little faces.
They used the jumps or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot crew turned to salt.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he left him to the visitors, especially families who were looking for the space and drying.
But the appeal of the festival did not detract from this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."
That is why there is nothing wrong with a repeat of the big party next year.
Although further work has yet to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear in a first record on Sunday in relation to the popular vote.
He described it as annoying that, in the meantime, the admission had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little weight.
The result: Some who had already paid no longer came to the area.
The response was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the salt refiner of the cooperator of about 1200 visitors said that they were in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound technology.
The salty hip-hop band Blocks 'n'Rox broke off their performance.
The technicians were not able to create a fairly reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha Lounges could not be built because the tents could not be transported to salt because of a tyre.
"Next year will be them," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was more than successful by the number of visitors.
That is what happens in bad weather.
However, the organizers have committed some errors, which are going to take place for the first time, but will have to be eliminated by the second edition.
In the social network of Facebook, too, the organisers need to be critical of the event.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"You have unfortunately taken over a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann, at the same location.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it is very good that some people are trying to put something on their feet.
Hats off," Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.
Now, the organisers are left with a year to correct these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark is shrinking.
That is not what is expected.
Rather, it is waiting for the component to be used to the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the establishment of the Space Observatory, the shell, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new cycle will be a little smaller than the old one at a diameter of 47,5 metres.
But the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new shell is the Kappentausch.
The upper part of the old shell is separated with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell will be set up.
If the weather matches, the action is scheduled to take place at the beginning of this week.
The event will take place at the Ice Bucket Challenge.
Isabelle Roberts, from the UK, so shouted when her icy waters was cast over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge was painful next to it.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she had so much trouble with the Ice Bucket Challenge.
Isabelle Roberts, from the UK, was so excited that her icy waters were cast over her head that she turned to her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I shouted, and while I did, my jaws just standing," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is covered by the 20-year olds.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that did not go, the jaws was lost, and then I understood that something did not agree.
My mother and my sister saw the same thing and made themselves laugh almost in the pants, but I had to go into the emergency.
The 20-year olds from the UK were admitted to the hospital in order to get rid of the jaws following participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an Internet sensation and a thousandfold on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon be pulling together again?
Finally, there has always been a clash between the two Wolfratshauser's castles.
Now, think about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, conducted the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgundy friends Wolfratshausen.
The positions, such as the history of the Wolfratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction, seemed very different to date.
Now the two camps are moving on: Joint action is to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the boards of Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on the demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down once," says Sjöberg.
In the future, all members of both clubs would be able to pull together in the future.
This is how it is possible to achieve visible results more quickly.
While the castle was at the forefront of rebuilding the castle at the Bergwald, the castle was at the forefront of the area.
Herbert Piffl, the president of the Burgfreunde, was delighted about the call.
Since the death of Dimume, he has been standing in front of the castle.
A new chairman is supposed to be found in a Member Meeting in mid-September.
At the moment the club, according to the 74 age group, has about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we've got the clubs to rest out of respect."
According to Piffl, the new president is supposed to go to the castle club.
Until then, the Burgfriends could also make a current mood within their grouping.
A candidate for the presidency is not yet available, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find themselves." He himself does not want to stand because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new President should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer would like to continue to cooperate in the project.
The different views on reconstruction will remain in the near future in the eyes of Piffls.
He praises Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.
They are a tourist magnet by a high involvement of the population and by volunteers from all around the world.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical about it.
In the course of time, however, I have found more and more conviction that it makes sense to push the project forward."
There is nothing other than that.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I won't just want to throw away the idea of reconstruction personally," he hopes that the Burgverein might be moving on this point.
Their goal of documenting the story first is "important and good."
After that, one could see how it could be seen.
Clever ways to save at university textbooks
As the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the Fast Zweitsemesterstudent Matt Schroeder issued a clever saving idea.
He invented a temporary loan scheme for students of a higher semester and offered nominal compensation to delay the return sale.
"My Mathematics usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick bit-a-kek," said Schroeder 19, who visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required for the last semester would have cost him 430, he said.
He gave $120.
The group reported that on average students spend more than 1,200 dollars a year on textbooks and study materials, that there are different cost control options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeder are increasingly the solution to the choice for the students.
Textbooks are becoming more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much lower price than when they purchase.
Neebo, which operates more than 250 university shops, announced that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college books were rented in the last spring ceremony, said Neebos Vice President, Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are bought by the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the unique one for the best deals.
Buying Online
Some new books cost only one third of the price for which they are in the Campus Book.
The ninth issue of "Calculus," vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290 but can be purchased at the specialized Chegg.com textbook dealer for $239.99.
How to Buy
If one of the notes of other or normal usage tracks is nothing, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, final student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used issue of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold anew for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors whether previous editions were permissible.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older spending can often be acquired at a fraction of the cost of the newest output.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is a popular alternative to used books.
Renting
The rent of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and do not want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a newly bought book.
A student, for example, could hire "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the regulations of the shop where you are renting, even in case of penalty fees, which may be used to write notes, underscores or usage tracks.
Renter: If you do not return the book, the penalty charges may exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-Books instead of traditional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus for 6 months" for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literary classes often find the best offers because many classics can be downloaded free of charge nowadays, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look at each case.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be visiting the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the pricing of books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And, before ordering an online order, you should check whether the book is in stock.
He learnt this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that four weeks had time and paid the full price in the college bookshop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy"
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Queen to Kill For" was played by only $12 million in its budget of $70 million.
The "Sex Tape" film tailored to Cameron Diaz only played $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children like "Dragon's Nest" also disappoint the revenue.
An article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that the children's films may be the reason for the lack of quality in the films themselves.
Collin referred to 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "Dragon men slightly made 2" as a purely functional fantasy sequel.
In films for a somewhat older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic rating for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013, and current year to at least 2000 screens.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equal to those of the previous year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services, such as Netflix.
"I think that times are changing," said director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Abe's upcoming jungle film, "I think times are changing."
We need to accept that and not try to emulate the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of the Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated sales of $1.2 billion of streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to 837 million dollars.
In the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film industry for focusing too much on filming comics and predicting a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators have argued that its dire prophecy could contain a real core.
However, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic about the potential blockbuster expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in the cash results recently as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporters: "The next summer will be the greatest summer in the cinema at all, and no one will worry more about the business."
When, a few years ago, the second table for table tennis was removed in order to tighten the lip, this was a step in the right direction.
Now, the German Table Tennis Federation has taken over an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the programme.
The result: Those who have not risen have gone down.
Thus, Captain Torpedo, who has avoided the descent of the Upper League, has yet to avoid the descent but is still only five stars in the coming season.
It is also possible to have a pair of seats, although it is one of the most important places to be played.
The boys and girls of Torpedo are starting in the Netherlands, just as the boys of the SC Weend.
SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserve are located in the new Association of Nations, they are not represented in the national league and they are not represented by the Göttingen clubs.
With the ladies, TTV Geismar plays in the League's League, the Torpedo Second in the League.
What looks like a better district class is now the new South District.
Here there are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the county league, regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weavers, in the county class of TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III, The women's districts start at least in nominal strength.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
In the county league, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen are running.
The nine teams, which had nine teams.
SC Weende sends its girls to the small county league.
Also the district league squadron of SCW boys, where Torpedo II is started, is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded Regionsverband, the two dioceses of Göttingen start with the nine teams.
In the West season are the red-white II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV, and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen, and SG Lenglern II.
Among them are Sattenhauss/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg, and Landolfshausen.
The team consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG rhume.
This is still better than in the case of Easter.
It is striking that none of the six cycle classes are achieved, but here the innovative and more powerful circle of directors will have to think about it.
NATO Summits: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of centre of Newport gathered to an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, some 150 people in Cardiff came together to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been pursuing the course of the weekend for us and has spoken to demonstrators travelling to Belgium from Bridgend.
Flying out of the Blue Mountains
Two young mosquitoes were brought to safety with the windle after they were caught in the blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke off at Govett Leap in Blackheath shortly after noon on Sunday.
Worried relatives called at about 20am by the police, when the two had not returned home.
A search rod broke down from the local police and rescue services, and the couple found them around 23: 00 in the vicinity of the Bridal Veil Waterfalls.
The girl had fallen on his knees and the man was toppled and had turned his head.
Rescue forces stayed overnight at the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in a stable state with a ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating Indigenous Protest in Pakistan
The about 1000 demonstrators were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
After almost half an hour, the transmitter has resumed the broadcasting.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged equipment in the editors.
Death or injury has not been reported.
The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the Heads of Government, who are accusing them of electoral fraud.
The police, around a kilometer from the home town of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, had once again arrived at clashes between about 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
After hospital information, a policeman was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to go to Sharifs Residenz.
They are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict, "to waste and to use without violence."
Moreover, the communication stated that "the army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The escalation of violence has fueled concern about military intervention, which has already been more frequently stirred up in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Preacher Tahirul Qadri have been held since Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters to resign on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qadri was similar to herself.
Khan reproaches Sharif to have won the parliamentary elections in May last year by means of fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the Central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and launch new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in the process of protecting the government quarter.
At first, the demonstrators had peacefully starved to Parliament until Khan and Qadri at the weekend cried out to go to Sharifs Residenz.
Hütteldorfer after a two-season victory on place 3 of the table.
With the 2: 0 above Grödig, a bitter end to a bitter week on Sunday took place.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached the end of Thursday with the end of the Europa League on Thursday.
"The experience of success was tremendously important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who pushed it to place with green white.
With the second round of the season, Schrammel-Traumtor has demonstrated the right response to the disappointment at Helsinki with the second season victory and is moving on to the national game break with a sense of success.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said Thomas Schrammel, Vice President, who set the course for victory with his magnificent guided Volley of the 14th minute at the 14th minute.
"I thought I'm going to watch all the frustration from Thursday," said the 26-year-old.
The last time he had met a Bundesligapartie on the 13th Nov. 2010 was still for Ried.
The first championship point in the Rapid Dress will thus remain in a special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I am there from the rapid youth," said Schrel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short range of pools, he turned the left to the right defensive side and made his case very well as well.
It has enough experience that it can also exercise this position.
The door has earned him, he has already done some assimilation this year," Barisic praised.
Team shows character Schrammel, also supplied the funnel at 2: 0 by Hofmann after a good one hour that finally brought the decision.
Because it could well have been possible for the guests to be able to write them.
"Thank goodness, we have had some luck today," noted Schrammel, who thus played at the gap between performance and result over the past few weeks: "The results did not vote, but the playful was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that "in many of the games previously had been better than today" against "the strongest team that played in the stadium this season."
The first three points since 26 July have thus demonstrated that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today, my team has shown that it has character."
For him it is equally gratifying: "We have finally played back to zero."
A lot of work during the period of the country Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar, and Michael Schimpelsberger, are several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their launch notes, made the victory even more valuable.
"We must not forget this," said Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic player, "who recently were very stable."
The country break thus needs to be used to "lick wounds and get a bit in the physical area," Barisic, who has five U21 selection actors in its ranks, has declared.
Captain Hofmann is one who is particularly keen on the break.
He tears himself up for the team, goes on to pain.
Especially at this difficult time he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann not only gave the structure to the game before he was confused at the 68th minute, but also achieved the second gate.
For the 33-year-olds who completed his 350 Bundesliga game, it was the first hit from the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 on the Admira).
Hofmann: "Do not believe that everything is fine now," "We have certainly also had a little luck, but eventually the luck also needs to return to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
He warned, however, that they would concentrate on working. "You cannot always see this in black and white.
We have not played as badly as we have seen in the last few weeks.
However, we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can help at the moment.
Some of them seem to me in some phases," said Hofmann.
Size Coach Michael Baur had little to do with his team.
He regretted the quick counterparty "from the magic gate", as well as the regular Nutz gate at the 40th minute, which was wrongly recognized by arbitrators.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that in some phases we were not specific enough.
We have had too few degrees there.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner looked like it: "It started badly, but then we found it and even made a gate.
By and large, there would have been more of it.
There is a Ruh among the summits.
A mighty tribe showed us how to handle the summer series "My piece of the Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still in the county.
A long walk leads up to the 600 years old oak.
It's up to skirts, basalt clusters, and basalt stones.
A little bit below the quarry of the Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, it stands.
It looks like a natural monument, it towers above the other trees of the area and reminds us of an area of more than eight metres to an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was no evidence of the name of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bishop's Archives and questions older people from Unterweißenbrunn in order to find out what is the relationship with the scourges.
The result of his investigation was the rather sober explanation of the name.
Thus, up to the age of 80, the culls of Unterweibrunn are going to have driven their animals from Unterweibrunn to the most arduous and liberated fields, which were liberated from stones.
At the foot of the building, the animals exhausted by the rise are supposed to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows there is more than that of goat herds.
The area has also been declared to the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve.
When you enter the stone collections, you should be careful because the basalt, warmed by the sun, is also popular for crossers.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweistebrunn to the tree.
Other routes are signposted, climbing up to the Hochrhön and inviting to an extended hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, it is rare to find a water castle that is sought by our next task.
The reflection of the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but in the county there are some historical buildings to which the building might fit.
Where is our "slice of the Rhöner Glück"?
My piece of Rhöner Glück
As with previous series of the Main Post in the past few years, it is also possible to win prizes this year if they have the right solution.
Anyone who likes to take photographs can also participate.
Under the e-mail address red.neustadt @ mainpost.de you can send us the solution and also your personal "slice of the Rhöner Glück" under this key word.

After weeks of war, Italy's prime minister and EU chairman, Matteo Renzi, have won the nomination of Secretary of State Federica Mogherini for strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit last week, and she will be the successor to British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government newspaper La Repubblica, which is reflected in the government newspaper La Repubblica, is aimed at strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU in the government team, which is also the favourite.
It also expects a boost for its "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to ensure that the left-wing party base, which is becoming increasingly popular against him, is calm, as Mogherini is assigned to this, albeit in a moderate manner.
With regard to the conservative representatives with the President of the Commission, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk would have the prevailing opinion in Rome in order to strike a political balance.
At the same time, the EU's chief diplomacy will be the vice-president of the President of the Commission.
The outstanding agreement of the European Parliament is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) as a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
The Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini, who has been renowned for its ambitions for almost two decades, will rise to the "enormous challenges,".
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her career career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra youth organization, which was joined in 2008 by the Catholic Zentrumparty Margherita to today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the left-wing Democratic party, it rose to high party politics, worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, the head of which was soon.
They, the main focus of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, were known by studies of NATO deployed in Afghanistan, in which Italy was involved with a military contingent, the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the US were known.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert in defense and European and international affairs.
When Renzi was Premier in February 2014, he led Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40% of the party's votes at the EU elections in May, then, as indicated in PD, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The reproaches in Brussels that the new EU external representatives have too little diplomatic experience, lack of substance, are experienced in the PD.
In Brussels, above all of Poland and the Baltic States, Mogherini's realistic emphasis on the crisis in Ukraine is persecuted and diffused as a "true-country friendly course."
It is in favour of the South Stream pipeline, operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is to be transported to southern Europe directly to southern Europe, bypassing the Ukraine, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi started his presidency as President of the EU, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for his first visit to Moscow.
Photos that they showed to the Shake hands with Putin were greeted with indignation in Brussels, just as they invited the Kremlin boss for October to a summit in Milan.

The Socialists in France should "keep the mouth and bring France in order," said Francois Hollande's main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided Left to show "their love" to the disputed socialist president, the cabinets of which met with disapproval by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said at great applause.
The prime minister, as a reassuring gesture, was that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite strong calls for relaxation of the regulation by the President Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urgently called on his fellow socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister for Justice, walked sand in the gearbox, in which she appeared at a meeting of breakaway socialist members of parliament, and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the leading leader of the National Front, derided the Socialist Group's constant defeat and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would run longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without dresses, but Prince Manuel Valls has none, she is forced to form a new government if the old one has not survived a summer.
"and the new will not survive the autumn or winter," said Le Pen, said to support Le Pen.
It repeated its party's call for a resolution by Parliament, and said that it was confident that it would emerge victorious when elections were held and be prepared for the government.
The French ruling party suffered defeat at the local elections in March, and the right-wing National Front was at the forefront of the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of the presidential term of 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and the record unemployment.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.

Pro-Hong Kong activists are condemning China on the day after the electoral decision.
A loyal group of experts waved the Chinese flag close to the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday, allowing only two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership in 2017.
All candidates first need to achieve the majority support of a nomination committee that is expected to be filled with fringe members.
By making this choice, it will be almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and have led pro-democracy activists to stop threatening their threat and engage in "Occupy Central" protests to paralyse the financial market of Hong Kong.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which China's dominance over Hong Kong was set out in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on electoral procedures in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands of people marched into the town's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Lis is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Permanent Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and Vice President of the Office of the Office of Hong Kong and Macon of the Council, should be consulted during the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they should assemble themselves in the afternoon at the office of the leaders in Hong Kong.
Britain did not foresee any democratic elements until the endpoint of the 150 year-old colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin requires Kiev to begin to set up "sovereign talks" with the Ostukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media, according to Russian media reports, on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting against the separatists in the country's east and begin to engage in negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine, under the control of the separatists, would become part of Russia, but that its status with Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government of negotiations on an equal footing with pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with the strategy followed by him since the beginning of the riots five months ago: Aid to the separatists in the supply of areas and pressure on the Ukrainian Government to enable the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija, the de facto independence for an alliance with Russia,
In an interview with the state television channel channel One Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas of the separatists held in eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukrainian peninsula to Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently described the captured territory as "Novorossija" or "Neurinland," a term that reminds of the pre-revolutionary glory of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who are attacking civilian communities in the areas of the separatists during the campaign of Ukrainian politicians, while government groups attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, are hoping to "be caught in their illusions" in the near future, Itar Tass reported.
"We need to hold further detailed talks, not only on technical matters, but also on the political organisation of the society and the state status of the south-east, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," said he.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood should be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kievans, in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, said Peskov.
It is not negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "Because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin's clarification of correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's comments underscored Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, unlike the direct eastern part of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the time before the conflict gave a large majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy mentioned by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in the Ukraine the power of negotiating their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control of an area that connects the Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula annexed to the Black Sea five months ago is the port for the majority of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and a historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov-area in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries, producing important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, at his address on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislation should consider amendments to the constitution, after elections, with which the respective regions are given greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But its conception of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast with those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement is charged with Moscow.
Putin's last request to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing was followed by the arrival of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded the previously peaceful region of the Aegean Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the hands, who, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, were the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal area to Crimea, the control of Novoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to secure Mariupol, a steel industry with 500,000 inhabitants, who lies between Novoasowsk and the narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leaders in Brussels and urgently asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take concrete action, the leadership demanded the proposal for further sanctions against Russia, which are supposed to enter into force with an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, said to import in Kiev on Saturday.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were included in the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk, were replaced on Sunday at 10 Russian paratroopers, who had been captured a week ago on Ukrainian territory, by Lysenko on Sunday.
Nude photography of Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko (Gabi Grecko)
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger about hackers, who probably have stolen nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a thing Who's Who was stolen by Hollywood.
The film city is in commotion after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the Internet in a hacking scandal.
The hacker, who is responsible for this, has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star of "the Tribute of panem" and of superstars, including the models of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers in Rihanna, Ariana Grande, and Lea Michelle, and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovoski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were allegedly made public because of a icloud gap.
On the list are 101 promis.
"It is disgusting," said edelsten, winner of Grecko's last month.
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, at the time of New York, reported that a news website said that the hack was "shameful," and that the people concerned felt "hurt."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which they are located at the top of a pool.
"Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth among the Palmers" films.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovoski, and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the chopped images.
A representative Lawrence said to TMZ: "It is a despicable violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen convicted the hackers in his tweet: "chopped images to be posted from a mobile phone is nothing other than selling Hehlerware."
From a purely legal point of view, the spreading of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The team "Help for Created Children" was supported by Radler, Jogger and hikers yesterday on the 8th of Radeln on the Great Feldberg.
The tour, which was one of them, was a light training for the other.
Everybody agreed on one thing: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski is likely to have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of Oberurseler Brewery was driven yesterday by bike to the Feldberg.
For the good purpose.
He can easily move away from small muscle craters, especially as the participation on the 8th cycle on the Great Feldberg in favour of the "Help of Cancer children" (Frankfurt) has also personally taught him a valuable insight.
It is a great thing.
"I now know that I can do that!
To move to the applet on the way to the applet?
Snow, when I once stopped, to wash it out...
As Thomas Studanski, who is sitting in the Church of the CDU in the Oberurseler city parliament, was subjected to many of the 718 participants yesterday at the dawn of the mountains and came close to the exhaustion, however, was happy with the plateau.
On the other hand, it has been easier to overcome the good and eleven kilometres long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
The red tape, red tape, red bike, which was made by red tape in red, turned out to be something on understatement ("Any quantity of professionals, there is the destination!"), although it turned out to be half a professional, after 45 minutes without breath of breath.
He, too, has run the course in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman of the city of Oberursel who, together with Frank Grüneisen, had embarked on the road.
For the two teams, "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "Here we are talking about charity, where we are happy to get with it - one exit would have been made today anyway," so Kuhn was.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) was left to Oberursel in the morning in order to walk again.
On the morning at 9: 00 p.m. in the saddle, Frankfurt Florian Zierz had a seat in the saddle, "made the Feldberg two times," and then to roll at home with pleasure.
Fun also had "Fez-Toni."
For the chef of the Oberurseler, bike tours over the Feldberg are simply part of it.
He had fired 40 minutes with its 6.5 kg of racing bike.
It is a crazy event.
For this purpose - I'm happy about it," Andreas Balzke said.
The trained Mainzer says that he is an "more ambitious racer."
That is what he has to be, because he was on the road with the 'fix bike', which is a bike, but without a gear...
The fact that it went up without a bicycle was proven not only by the 20 hikers, who climbed above the White Wall, but also to the top of the summit, but also a jogger who was given an authority with weights with weights behind them.
Mountaineering is a doctor who said: "I'm training for a special sledgehammer that only attracts the sleigh."
The 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The trekkers start at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 am.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers left the first mountain bike.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the "Radeln auf den GrossFeldberg", gave the starting commands and wanted the participants to take a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to close the track to Feldberg to the security of the participants.
