Pe@@ tr Č@@ ech : transfer at the last minute ?
everything is possible
today is the last day when it is still possible to jump through the transfer window and make a major change .
the next chance wo n@@ '@@ t come until winter .
Pe@@ tr Č@@ ech is currently a substitute go@@ al@@ keep@@ er for Chelsea , but now he does not await a new professional contract in Madrid , Mon@@ ac@@ o or even Paris .
he is sitting at the N@@ H H@@ ote@@ l in Prague , talking to Czech reporters , and he is planning to participate with the Czech team in a re@@ hear@@ s@@ al match with the Americans , after which he will also start the process of quali@@ fication for Euro 2016 against the Netherlands .
Chelsea will give priority in the new season of the Premier League to T@@ hi@@ b@@ aut Cour@@ to@@ is in the goal , and Č@@ ech for the first time in ten years in the London team has ended up in the position of substitute .
some time ago , it was specu@@ lated that Re@@ al Madrid might be interested in Č@@ ech .
at the start of the season , he lost the Spanish Sup@@ er Cup in competition with athle@@ tics and did not even manage to enter the league season , when he lost 2 : 4 in San Se@@ bast@@ ian .
interest from Paris S@@ G was also specu@@ lated about .
it started the French League season with two wins and two draws , and on Sunday it defeated St. E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne 5 : 0 .
it is putting the most pressure on as Mon@@ ac@@ o .
it so far has a balance of 1-@@ 1-@@ 2 in the league , and over the weekend it par@@ ted with L@@ ille with a 1 : 1 tie .
today news appeared on tab@@ lo@@ id Engli@@ sh-@@ language web@@ sites stating that the que@@ ens Park R@@ ang@@ ers may want Č@@ ech .
however , according to English book@@ makers , Č@@ ech '@@ s departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely .
S@@ ky@@ bet assigned him odds of 4 : 1 .
Pe@@ tr , is it possible that during the remaining few hours you will change your uniform ?
I do n@@ '@@ t anticipate it , but in soccer nothing is ever 100 % .
for example , during the day an offer can arrive that ca n@@ '@@ t be refused .
how would such an offer have to look ?
-LRB- laugh@@ s -RRB- `` Well , I do n@@ '@@ t know yet , how the kind of offer that ca n@@ '@@ t be refused basically looks .
there would have to be a consensus among all parties , and mainly would depend on Chelsea '@@ s position as to whether or not to examine the offer .
is it even technically possible to make such a transfer when you '@@ re in Prague now ?
would n@@ '@@ t it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in a new location ?
well , I have n@@ '@@ t considered that .
but in such a situation , there are a lot of players today , and all of them are somewhere in representation matches , and certainly today a lot of transfers will be fin@@ alized .
so it could be somewhat achievable .
how many clubs are there in the world that could afford you ?
well , I really do n@@ '@@ t know .
and are you not pushing for departure ?
the situation when I have not ended up anywhere as a go@@ al@@ keep@@ er in the first three games of the new season is new for my fif@@ teen@@ -year career .
nonetheless , there is no need to panic , pack up and go somewhere .
I want to stay in the competition for the position of Chelsea go@@ al@@ keep@@ er , and it '@@ s up to the co@@ ach who gets selected and what decisions he will make in the weeks to come .
what role has your family played in your decisions ?
I take all factors into consideration .
sports prospects are understandably important for me , but I also look at everything from a personal point of view , which of course includes consideration for the family '@@ s needs .
is it possible that you could play as a go@@ al@@ keep@@ er for different team in England ?
that '@@ s a question that I though would never apply to me .
but in soccer everything is possible .
I do n@@ '@@ t want to rule out anything .
I do n@@ '@@ t know the answer .

Recon@@ ne@@ cting With the very American ideal That Labor Rights Ar@@ e Human Rights
con@@ gressmen K@@ ei@@ th El@@ li@@ son and John Le@@ w@@ is have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right .
`` As go unions , so go middle-class jobs , '@@ ' says El@@ li@@ son , the Min@@ nes@@ ota Democrat who serves as a Congressional Pro@@ gressive C@@ au@@ c@@ us co-@@ chair .
that '@@ s why I '@@ m proud to introduce the employee Em@@ powerment Act with civil rights ic@@ on John Le@@ w@@ is .
this ground@@ -@@ breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-@@ union forces in their tracks
am@@ ending the National Labor Re@@ lations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for engaging in union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compens@@ atory and punitive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative .
but it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what El@@ li@@ son , Le@@ w@@ is and the co@@ sponsors of their legislation are proposing is as a re@@ connection with a very American idea .
despite the bat@@ tering that unions have taken in recent years - in W@@ is@@ con@@ sin , Mich@@ ig@@ an and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embrace , extend and respect labor rights .
there was a time , within the living memory of millions of Americans , when this country championed democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same breath .
when the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General D@@ ou@@ gla@@ s Mac@@ Arthur and his aides encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that H@@ ide@@ ki To@@ jo '@@ s militarized autocracy would be replaced with democracy .
fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan , they included language that explicitly recognized that `` the right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed . '@@ '
when the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Adol@@ f Hitler '@@ s fascism was replaced with mus@@ c@@ ular democracy .
recognizing that workers would need to organize and make their voices heard in the new nation , the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared : `` The right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profession .
agreements that restrict or seek to impa@@ ir this right shall be nul@@ l and vo@@ id ; measures directed to this end shall be unlawful .
when former First L@@ ady E@@ lean@@ or Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights , which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global cov@@ en@@ ant , Roosevelt and the draf@@ ters included a guarantee that `` everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests . '@@ '
for generations , Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights .
when this country coun@@ se@@ led other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies , Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected .
now , with those rights under assault in America , it is wise , indeed , to re@@ commit to the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society .
as the R@@ ever@@ end Martin Luther King J@@ r. said fifty years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the labor movement did not diminish the strength of the nation but enlarged it .
by raising the living standards of millions , labor miracul@@ ously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to und@@ re@@ amed of levels of production .
those who attack labor forget these simple truths , but history re@@ members them .
history re@@ members , as should we .
the formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long overdue .
K@@ ei@@ th El@@ li@@ son and John Le@@ w@@ is are rene@@ wing ideals that have historically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy .
judge temporarily blocks law that could close all Louisi@@ ana abortion clinics
a U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Louisi@@ ana law that advocates say would likely have closed all five abortion clinics in the state .
the measure , signed into law by Louisi@@ ana Governor B@@ ob@@ by J@@ ind@@ al in June and due to take effect Sep@@ t . 1 , would require doctors who perform abor@@ tions to have patient admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice .
however , the judge '@@ s ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abor@@ tions while seeking such privileges .
`` pla@@ inti@@ ffs will be allowed to operate law@@ fully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges , '@@ ' Federal Jud@@ ge John de@@ Gra@@ vel@@ les wrote in the decision .
a hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law .
abortion rights activists ap@@ plau@@ ded the decision , the latest in a string of ru@@ lings against similar measures , saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges .
`` T@@ oday '@@ s ruling ensures Louisi@@ ana women are safe from an under@@ handed law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights , '@@ ' said Nan@@ cy Nor@@ th@@ up , president and chief executive of the Center for Re@@ productive Rights , which su@@ ed to block the law on behalf of three of the state '@@ s five clinics .
it was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clinics who were not pla@@ inti@@ ffs in the suit and have also applied for admitting privileges .
Louisi@@ ana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws , with courts recently ruling un@@ constitutional such measures in A@@ lab@@ ama and Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i .
key parts of a Texas law that would have shut@@ tered most remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Fri@@ day .
abortion rights campaigners , along with the American College of Ob@@ ste@@ tr@@ icians and Gy@@ ne@@ col@@ og@@ ists and the American Medical Association , say admitting privileges laws impose med@@ ically unnecessary requirements on doctors .
Anti-@@ abortion advocates have countered that the measures aim to protect women '@@ s health , though some have also lau@@ ded their effect of shut@@ tering clinics .
only one doctor who per@@ forms abor@@ tions in Louisi@@ ana has hospital admitting privileges , the Center for Re@@ productive Rights said .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abor@@ tions , that doctor , fearful for his safety , would stop carrying out the procedure , the group said .
in arguing against the ruling , Louisi@@ ana officials said they would not punish doctors performing abor@@ tions while their applications for admitting privileges were pending .
delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment mean ov@@ arian cancer kil@@ ls more in rural areas
Angel@@ ina J@@ oli@@ e and her brother James have post@@ ed a video tribu@@ te to their late mother who died of ov@@ arian cancer in 2007 .
women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ov@@ arian cancer than their city counterparts .
researchers analy@@ sed medical records of more than 1@@ 100 Australian women diagnosed with ov@@ arian cancer in 2005 , finding just 35 per cent lived for five years after diagnosis .
lead research@@ er S@@ us@@ an Jordan , of the Q@@ IM@@ R Ber@@ gh@@ of@@ er Medical Research Institute , said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
small study : new drugs may slow l@@ ung , ov@@ arian cancer
the researchers trac@@ ked the women '@@ s medical jour@@ ne@@ ys across seven years .
D@@ r Jordan said a woman '@@ s age at the time of diagnosis , ov@@ arian cancer type , having existing illnesses and socio-@@ economic status also imp@@ acted on survival chances .
older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the poorest survival rates .
those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ov@@ arian cancer , D@@ r Jordan suggested delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors .
`` This disease is best treated by gy@@ na@@ ecological on@@ col@@ og@@ y sur@@ ge@@ ons and they '@@ re mostly based in major cities , '@@ ' she said .
despite improving tele@@ -@@ medicine services to less@@ en the tyranny of distance , she suggested more f@@ ly-@@ in , f@@ ly-@@ out services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people in treatment away from their communities could help .
D@@ r Jordan said regardless of geographical status , the study found long-term survival among women with ov@@ arian cancer was poor , reinforcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
the research , funded by the Rio T@@ into ride to conquer cancer , will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
in March 2012 , at 33 years of age , young G@@ old Coast mum Eli@@ sh@@ a Ne@@ a@@ ve was told that she had an aggressive form of ov@@ arian cancer .
gar@@ den cent@@ res ru@@ e fall in homeowners
the drop , coupled with a particular decline in the number of homeowners aged under 35 , could result in gar@@ den cent@@ res losing out on tens of millions of po@@ unds a year when today '@@ s young consumers reach the `` core gar@@ den@@ ing age group , '@@ ' according to the H@@ T@@ A '@@ s study , which was reported by the Financial Times .
according to the report , people r@@ enting properties spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that those with their own homes spend on their gar@@ den@@ s .
it cited the rise in people living in highly urban@@ ised areas with no gar@@ den@@ s , the popularity of pav@@ ing over front gar@@ den@@ s for par@@ king and shrinking gar@@ den size as other factors threatening the industry , which is worth an estimated £ 5 billion in sales each year .
greater London , where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years , has Britain '@@ s lowest spend per household on gar@@ den@@ ing products .
the H@@ T@@ A and Royal hor@@ ticultur@@ al Society said that r@@ enting property or a lack of gar@@ den space did not mean people could not grow plants .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , chief hor@@ ticultur@@ al adviser to the R@@ H@@ S , said : `` con@@ tain@@ er gar@@ den@@ ing , for example , is especially popular with ren@@ ters who can move their plants when they re@@ locate . '@@ '
the H@@ T@@ A report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the gar@@ den retail sector '@@ s ` golden age '@@ ' as a result of increased home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to mid-@@ 1990s .
it also predicted an improved market this year due to better weather following un@@ fav@@ ou@@ rable conditions in March and April last year .
when an Eastern dictator preach@@ es about democracy .
at a meeting of his youth organization , which must resembles Hitler You@@ th , ra@@ tt@@ led his sab@@ ers by pointing out that Russia has nuclear weapons and basically made clear to everyone that he does n@@ '@@ t care about their opinions , today he gave us a lecture about democracy .
however , I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia has many characteristics of a F@@ as@@ cist state .
large countries have one thing in common , and that is that they can both take advantage of passionate nationalism and transform an inferi@@ ority complex into imperialist appeti@@ tes .
time apparently passes differently in the East than in the West .
while the Western world has been believing that the era of wars and dominance over Europe is over , in the East they think on the contrary that they have been overlooked for too long already and that it is necessary to regain their international position .
such mo@@ ods and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s , shortly before the Nazis took power , and that was followed by an eruption of nationalism not unlike today '@@ s situation in Russia .
the absolutely identical cult of a powerful leader , beating of journalists , liquid@@ ation of political opponents and discrimination against ga@@ ys and other minorities are all very close to that mindset .
Vladimir Putin and certainly many Russians apparently miss the time when Russia ruled half of the world and the other half feared it .
Western politicians must have caused it themselves , maybe by not pat@@ ting Vladimir on the shoulders enough , maybe by not inv@@ iting him to where he wanted to go and maybe by starting to underestimate him , after which he just behaved like a typical Russian strong@@ man .
he established order at home , he acted like he did n@@ '@@ t even want to go anywhere , and he shar@@ pen@@ ed his kni@@ ves at home .
now he has decided that he wants to regain his country '@@ s lost position .
he '@@ ll start gradually , because he has time .
he '@@ ll probably be leader for life , so why hur@@ ry ?
he stepped on the Caucasus , now he '@@ s stepping on Ukraine , and the dwar@@ fs from the Baltics are probably next .
they have been a th@@ or@@ n in the eye of the Russian bear for a long time already .
this certainly will also be noticed by China , who has been making a lot of waves and has its eye on the Far East .
and the Germans too are really up@@ setting Vladimir with how well they are doing , and we really k@@ icked their as@@ ses in 1945 .
how about establishing a Nov@@ oro@@ ssi@@ ya in Kar@@ lovy vary ?
that could be a small base , and there are plenty of compatriots there , and they are so oppressed there , and some locals already have wanted to Demo@@ li@@ sh some of their houses .
after all , our veterans still remember how well they had it in Czechoslovakia .
and their prime minister , G@@ os@@ pod@@ in S@@ ob@@ ot@@ ka , he so soft that he can be pe@@ eled like an oni@@ on , and with him their entire EU too .
that '@@ s how it would play out , so that great Russia could re-@@ emerge .
they need to be reminded where their place is .
and we can use our country@@ men who live on their territory as weapons .
there are plenty of Russians everywhere , and when it is said that they are oppressed , then they are simply oppressed , and we will not leave it like that , but we will protect them .
and then the Russians will be in control again , because what else are they born for after all ?
after all , Europe is merely a stepping stone , on which proud Ivan can do a Co@@ ss@@ ack dance .
Turkey summon@@ s US diplomat O@@ ver spying Report
the Turkish foreign ministry has summon@@ ed the most senior U.S. diplomat in the country for clari@@ fication of a report about American and British spying in Turkey .
deputy Prime Minister Bul@@ ent said the U.S. charge d@@ '@@ Aff@@ aires and Turkish officials had discussed the report M@@ ond@@ ay .
German magazine D@@ er Spi@@ egel and the online magazine The inter@@ cep@@ t said that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analy@@ st Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den show that Turkey was a high priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services .
according to Turkish news wi@@ res , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan down@@ played the importance of the report , saying that all major countries spi@@ ed on each other .
an earlier report that Germany '@@ s main intelligence agency had also targeted Ankar@@ a drew a more angry response from the Turkish government .

Mag@@ alu@@ f police chief charged over corruption

the head of Cal@@ vi@@ à police on the holiday island of Ma@@ jor@@ ca has been arrested following corruption claims filed by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hot@@ spot of Mag@@ alu@@ f .
chief inspec@@ tor José An@@ toni@@ o Nav@@ ar@@ ro has been re@@ man@@ ded in cust@@ ody following corruption claims made against him by several businessmen from P@@ un@@ ta B@@ allen@@ a , the street where most of Mag@@ alu@@ f '@@ s bars and night@@ clubs are located .
according to online daily Mal@@ lor@@ ca Di@@ ari@@ o , the claim@@ ants presented proof of ex@@ tor@@ tion by policemen and Cal@@ vi@@ à T@@ own H@@ all civil servants at the office of Ma@@ jor@@ ca '@@ s anti-corruption prosecutor on Fri@@ day .
two other local police officers were arrested by Spanish Civil Gu@@ ards in connection to the corruption claims and will have to be questioned by a judge alongside Nav@@ ar@@ ro .
Spanish national daily A@@ BC reported the dis@@ g@@ run@@ t@@ led night@@ club owners as saying fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tism by authorities was having a serious effect on their businesses .
`` It '@@ s not about making money anymore , it '@@ s about surviving , '@@ ' one of the businessmen told the court .
you do n@@ '@@ t mess with our livelihoods .
we have nothing to lose .
Mag@@ alu@@ f made international headlines this summer as a result of a vir@@ al You@@ Tu@@ be video which showed an 18@@ -year-old British holid@@ ay@@ maker performing fel@@ la@@ ti@@ o on 24 men during a pub cra@@ wl .
island authorities have since attempted to cla@@ mp down on the dr@@ unk and disorderly behavi@@ our of Mag@@ alu@@ f holiday re@@ vel@@ lers by minim@@ izing numbers on the notorious alco@@ hol@@ -@@ fuelled bar cra@@ w@@ ls .
in addition , the P@@ lay@@ house club where the fel@@ la@@ ti@@ o incident took place was forced to shut down for a year , while P@@ lay@@ house and the bar cra@@ wl organizers carnage were jointly fin@@ ed € 5@@ 5,000 -LRB- $ 7@@ 3,000 -RRB- .

first day of spring marked with w@@ et and blu@@ stery conditions imp@@ acting A@@ dela@@ ide Air@@ port flights
spring has spr@@ ung a win@@ try surprise on southern South Australia , bringing heavy show@@ ers and strong winds that have affected flights at A@@ dela@@ ide Air@@ port .
a further 5@@ m@@ m of rain fell on the city in the evening up to 9@@ p@@ m , following the 6.@@ 6@@ m@@ m that fell overnight on Sunday .
the latest rain came cour@@ te@@ sy of a couple of short , blu@@ stery show@@ ers , including a burst that started just before 8@@ p@@ m that du@@ mped almost 4@@ m@@ m in about 10 minutes .
after winter delivered an early dose of spring last week , temperatures dropped again on M@@ ond@@ ay to a high of just 15@@ .@@ 8@@ C in the city .
the squ@@ ally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Vir@@ gin Air@@ lines flight from Melbourne to A@@ dela@@ ide .
the plane was scheduled to land just after 7.@@ 3@@ 0@@ p@@ m but was hit by wind@@ she@@ ar - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out .
wind gu@@ sts were reaching about 5@@ 0@@ k@@ m@@ /@@ h on the ground at A@@ dela@@ ide Air@@ port at the time .
flight data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.@@ 4@@ 0@@ p@@ m .
that flight '@@ s delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights , including an E@@ mi@@ rates flight from Dubai and a Q@@ ant@@ as flight from Sydney .
a top of 16@@ C is forecast for A@@ dela@@ ide on Tu@@ es@@ day , with the chance of a sho@@ wer or two .
Israeli Chil@@ dren Re@@ turn to School After Gaza War
thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school M@@ ond@@ ay after spending the summer in bomb shel@@ ters as rockets and mort@@ ars rained on their communities during the 50-@@ day Israel-@@ Hamas war , while schools in Gaza remained shut@@ tered as the territory recovered from the fighting .
the start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to rocke@@ t-@@ scar@@ red communities in southern Israel , but the signs of the fighting remained fresh .
in the southern city of Ash@@ do@@ d , employees at the `` Pa@@ sho@@ sh '@@ ' kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , which was struck by a rocket , removed sh@@ rap@@ nel marks off the walls and sli@@ des ahead of the students ' arrival .
`` We are a little scared but we are ex@@ cited , '@@ ' said R@@ on@@ it Bar@@ t , a re@@ sident of ki@@ b@@ but@@ z Sa@@ ad and an English teacher in its school .
a lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine .
her 1@@ 1-@@ year-old daughter , Sh@@ ani Bar@@ t , said it felt a `` little bit we@@ ir@@ d '@@ ' to suddenly be going back to school .
`` There were some difficult times and we did n@@ '@@ t leave our houses at all , '@@ ' she said .
President R@@ eu@@ ven Ri@@ v@@ lin visited the ki@@ b@@ but@@ z , which is located close to the Gaza border , to offer his support .
until a cease-fire halted the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities like Sa@@ ad remained in@@ doors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rocket and mort@@ ar fire .
many residents of Na@@ hal O@@ z , a community close to the Gaza frontier where a 4-@@ year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mort@@ ar shell , are hesit@@ ant about coming back .
the Education Ministry said about a dozen families still had not returned .
their children have been placed in alterna@@ te schools for the time being .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in S@@ der@@ ot , a Gaza border town that has been hard hit by Palestinian fire .
he urged the children to study hard and said `` we will make sure to provide you with knowledge and provide you with security . '@@ '
Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-@@ ended truce last Tu@@ es@@ day .
the cease-fire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues unresolved , such as Hamas ' demand for the lifting of an Israel-@@ Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the re@@ opening of Gaza '@@ s air and sea@@ ports .
Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt .
the war killed more than 2,@@ 100 Palestinians , three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 4@@ 9@@ 4 children , according to Palestinian and U@@ .@@ N@@ . estimates .
Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants , though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims .
on the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,@@ 5@@ 91 rockets and mort@@ ars at Israeli cities during the fighting , mostly in the south .
the Israeli military , meanwhile , carried out more than 5,000 air@@ strikes and other attacks .
the Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza , and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U@@ .@@ N@@ . schools turned into make@@ shift shel@@ ters .
with tens of thousands of people still in the shel@@ ters and fighting still raging , education officials delayed the start of the school year last week .
`` I hope the school will open soon to complete our education , just like the world '@@ s children and Jewish children , '@@ ' said Mohammad A@@ mara , a 13@@ -year-old boy staying in a Gaza City school .
V@@ r@@ ba at event : I '@@ m behind Vá@@ chou .
and Laf@@ ata has a fever
today before no@@ on , the Czech soccer team met in Prague ahead of the W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day prepar@@ atory match with the United States and the subsequent initial match of the quali@@ fication for the European Ch@@ ampi@@ on@@ ship in the Netherlands .
one of the team '@@ s 23 members , S@@ par@@ ta '@@ s offensive player David Laf@@ ata , has a fever .
David is not here yet , but last week S@@ par@@ ta had some problems , which involved multiple players , and David apparently still has some of those problems .
but we want him to be here and for him to be feeling better as soon as possible , '@@ ' co@@ ach Pavel V@@ r@@ ba told reporters .
`` W@@ he@@ ther it will be two or three days or he will be fit tomorrow will depend on his health condition , about which our doctor will decide .
the other players are fine .
`` O@@ f course , someone has some pain from time to time , but it '@@ s not so bad that they can not practice or participate in the match with the United States on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , '@@ ' the Czech co@@ ach said .
on Sunday evening , V@@ r@@ ba called up S@@ par@@ ta reserve player Lu@@ ká@@ še Vá@@ chu last .
he has admitted that it was not an easy decision , and other mid-@@ fi@@ el@@ ders were considered .
`` I made my decision based on the fact that Lu@@ ká@@ š is a perspective player who is 25 years old .
the decision was very difficult , but I stand behind it , '@@ ' V@@ r@@ ba said regarding Vá@@ chu .
and what about Š@@ ural ?
time will tell what will happen with Laf@@ ata .
the possibility that the nomination could still be changed if there are health problems can not be ruled out .
over the weekend , Liber@@ ec '@@ s Jose@@ f Š@@ ural , for example , performed excell@@ ently when he did a hat trick .
of course , they are players who have been demonstrating their talent recently .
time will tell how David Laf@@ ata will feel .
if he will not be available on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , then I do n@@ '@@ t claim that I can not nomin@@ ate another player who has performed well in the Czech league to replace him , '@@ ' V@@ r@@ ba said .

the match with the Americans will start on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day at 8 : 15 p@@ .@@ m. , and in it the national team hopes to achieve a premier victory under V@@ r@@ ba '@@ s co@@ aching .

V@@ r@@ ba is gla@@ d that unlike during previous matches he has more time for training .
`` It '@@ s an advantage , when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them , which we did n@@ '@@ t have as much time for before .

before the game in Prague , the Dutch team will play in Italy on T@@ hur@@ sday , and the match will be watched personally by temporary team co@@ ach Jose@@ f Pe@@ š@@ ice .
he will give us information from the match as it becomes available .
but it wo n@@ '@@ t be only about him . we will also have the game fil@@ med , and we will analyze it .
there is a new tra@@ in@@ er coming to the Netherlands , so we will see what kinds of changes there will be , '@@ ' V@@ r@@ ba said , refer@@ ring to the br@@ on@@ ze med@@ alists from the recent World Ch@@ ampi@@ on@@ ship .
housing prices have post@@ ed their strongest winter gain in seven years , according to a wide@@ ly-@@ watched gau@@ ge .
the R@@ P data C@@ ore@@ L@@ og@@ ic H@@ ed@@ onic home value index of Australian capital city dwel@@ ling prices rose by 1.1 per cent in August , R@@ P data said on M@@ ond@@ ay .
the rise brought the total gain over the June , July and August to 4.@@ 2 per cent , the biggest rise over the winter months since 2007 .
annual growth in prices came in at 1@@ 0.@@ 9 per cent , more than double the gain of the 12 months to August 2013 , but the gains were not evenly spread across the country .
R@@ P data research director T@@ im lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two tier market .
the R@@ P data figures show Sydney home prices rose by 16@@ .@@ 1 per cent in the past year , while Melbourne '@@ s were up by 1@@ 1.7 per cent .
the next strongest markets were A@@ dela@@ ide , B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e and Darwin , with price rises averaging between five and six per cent .
at the other end of the scale was Can@@ ber@@ ra , hit by government spending cutbacks , where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent through the year .
Mr lawless said that now spring has begun there would be a rise in list@@ ings of properties for sale over the coming few months , which would be a `` real test '@@ ' for the market .
`` considering the ongoing high rate of auction cle@@ ar@@ ance rates , a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment , it '@@ s likely that dwel@@ ling values will rise even further over the next three months , '@@ ' he said .
Len@@ ny Henry : my father never hu@@ gged me .
never said `` I love you '@@ '
Henry was one of seven children born to Jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an immigrants in D@@ ud@@ ley in the Mid@@ lands in 1958 .
his father , who died when Henry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry is re@@ hear@@ sing a com@@ edy , Ru@@ dy '@@ s rare records , which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the R@@ adi@@ o 4 series .
the soun@@ d@@ track is a mix of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p and the tu@@ nes are up@@ beat .
but Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood .
there was `` a lot '@@ ' of therapy after his mother died and Henry is reflec@@ tive about his relationship with his father .
he was very un@@ know@@ able .
you never saw his face , you just heard his voice : ` St@@ op the no@@ ise .
leave your sister alone .
move !
I want to watch the cricket .
my older brothers S@@ ey@@ m@@ our and Hil@@ ton - who were grow@@ n@@ -up when I was a k@@ id - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the be@@ er glass , the beauty of the stroke in cricket .
I never had a conversation with him like that .
he was this un@@ sm@@ iling blo@@ ke in the corner , reading the paper for a lot of my life .
recently Henry opened a foun@@ dry in D@@ ud@@ ley and , although conditions were better than in his father '@@ s day , he got a sna@@ p@@ shot of what life must have been like for him .
it '@@ s a bit brigh@@ ter now but they '@@ re dark , smo@@ ky , S@@ ty@@ gi@@ an la@@ by@@ rin@@ th@@ ine dep@@ ths with bur@@ sts of fla@@ me and smoke and lots of so@@ ot .
my dad used to get in the ba@@ th and just lie there and you '@@ d hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would wa@@ sh the foun@@ dry off him .
when I wal@@ ked round it , I real@@ ised that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table , and my estima@@ tion of him went up .
none the less , Henry emerged from a childhood stripped of par@@ ental affec@@ tion .
my dad never did hu@@ gging , never said , ` I love you ' .
it was n@@ '@@ t until my mum was poorly near the end of her life that we started saying ` I love you , I love you , I love you .
having a daughter of his own , B@@ illi@@ e , with Da@@ wn French , enabled him to share the love he missed as a child .
could you stop with the `` I love you '@@ ' ?
just stop hu@@ gging me !
dad , I '@@ m 22 !
with Da@@ wn French .
why would n@@ '@@ t I be friends with her ?
she '@@ s a great mum
he '@@ s still very good friends with French , to whom he was married for 25 years .
dawn '@@ s a good person .
why would n@@ '@@ t I be friends with Da@@ wn ?
she '@@ s a great mum .
Henry '@@ s own mother was diabe@@ tic .
it was one of the things that killed her .
so when I became very , very over@@ weight and started getting diabe@@ tic symptoms , my doctor said , ` You '@@ ve got to be radical .
so I went on a big fit@@ ness thing , and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it '@@ s very hard .
and it '@@ s te@@ dious .
nobody likes eating car@@ rots .
Henry '@@ s change in career trajectory is , perhaps , reflected in his distinguished , clo@@ se-@@ crop@@ ped be@@ ard .
since he won critical ac@@ claim for his O@@ th@@ el@@ lo , he has become en@@ gro@@ ssed in the the@@ at@@ re .
com@@ edy of errors followed , as did f@@ ences by August Wilson .
it '@@ s a different experience from the s@@ it@@ coms and com@@ edies that have up@@ hol@@ stered his busy working life .
he started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory .
a D@@ J spot@@ ted him on stage doing im@@ pres@@ sions and wrote to New F@@ ac@@ es about him .
his TV career was launched in the mid-@@ S@@ ev@@ en@@ ties : `` For quite a long time I was the only black im@@ pres@@ sion@@ ist@@ /@@ com@@ ed@@ ian on tel@@ ly . '@@ '
he lear@@ n@@ t on the job .
not only did I have to grow up in the public eye , I had to learn how to be an efficient jo@@ ke@@ -@@ delivering mechanism between 1975 and 1985 , wh@@ il@@ st being a star , being on television and it was really difficult .
Len@@ ny on New F@@ ac@@ es in 1975
because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Min@@ stre@@ l S@@ how , a light entertainment program@@ me in which people `` bla@@ cked up , '@@ ' Henry found himself performing his com@@ edy in it for five years .
my family were very uncomfortable about it .
I sort of wish it had never happened , but I do n@@ '@@ t regret that I did it .
although it was a we@@ ir@@ d , repre@@ hen@@ sible position to be in , I was working in huge ven@@ ues and learning how to work a crowd .
but what was an `` awar@@ d-@@ winning light entertainment st@@ ap@@ le of British television for years and years '@@ ' was also a `` gro@@ tes@@ que pa@@ rody of black people . '@@ '
introducing charac@@ ters who both lam@@ po@@ oned and celebrated black British culture , Henry worked on the alternative com@@ edy circu@@ it in the E@@ igh@@ ties .
the first series of The Len@@ ny Henry S@@ how ai@@ red in 1984 , and in the N@@ ine@@ ties he was known as , among other things , ch@@ ef G@@ are@@ th Black@@ lock in the com@@ edy series ch@@ ef ! .
advertis@@ ements , document@@ aries , TV series and parts in films consumed his next decade but after his 2008 BBC series , Len@@ ny@@ Hen@@ ry@@ .@@ t@@ v , he thought : `` What are you going to do next , L@@ en , because it all feels a bit like you '@@ re marking time or you '@@ re slightly going side@@ ways . '@@ '
what came next was a R@@ adi@@ o 4 document@@ ary series called What '@@ s So Great Ab@@ out ... ?
the first was on Shakespe@@ are .
I had a real aller@@ gy to Shakespe@@ are .
I was n@@ '@@ t really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of middle-class white people with tigh@@ ts and a cab@@ bage down the front .
so I was very frightened of it .
everybody we inter@@ viewed on that show , Peter H@@ all , Tre@@ vor N@@ un@@ n , A@@ dri@@ an L@@ est@@ er , Jud@@ i Den@@ ch , said , ` You should try it .
do n@@ '@@ t sla@@ g it off if you do n@@ '@@ t know what you '@@ re talking about .
get some of the words in your mouth and then you '@@ ll understand why we all love Shakespe@@ are so much .
Henry delivered 20 lines of O@@ th@@ el@@ lo '@@ s last speech for the document@@ ary and he was ho@@ oked .
it gave me the feeling that I could do it .
it '@@ s almost like I had my head put on straight for me .
` This is what it '@@ s about , it '@@ s a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your lines , do some research .
so the re@@ hear@@ s@@ al process was brutal and I was reading that play for months and months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car crash and it did n@@ '@@ t quite happen .
soon he was star@@ ring in com@@ edy of errors .
suddenly I '@@ m at the National the@@ at@@ re and I just could n@@ '@@ t quite believe it .
there was one moment where I thought , ` O@@ h , you '@@ ve changed . '@@ ' '@@ '
there was a technical fault and Henry instinc@@ tively felt that it was his job to keep the audience enter@@ tained .
`` A little voice inside me said , ` You '@@ re going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer . '@@ ' '@@ '
instead , the stage manager announced the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved .
I wal@@ ked off the stage and something in me went , `` O@@ h , thank God . '@@ '
it '@@ s not my responsibility .
I can let somebody else sort it out .
` You '@@ re in a play , stay in character . '@@ ' '@@ '
Henry appearing in f@@ ences at the D@@ uch@@ ess the@@ at@@ re
learning his lines for f@@ ences was challenging .
panic '@@ s quite good , it sti@@ ff@@ ens the sin@@ e@@ ws .
that was well received too , so it '@@ s like a big sign from the g@@ ods , saying , ` This is what you should be doing . '@@ ' '@@ '
he says this , of course , in a booming voice .
so I '@@ m sticking with it .
I '@@ m really loving it .
I love being in a re@@ hear@@ s@@ al room .
Henry still has a com@@ ed@@ ian '@@ s brain , though - throughout , our conversation is broken with fla@@ shes of his hum@@ our as he sli@@ ps in and out of im@@ pres@@ sions .
I '@@ m just choosing not to do stand@@ -up because that thing of getting instant gra@@ tification from a room full of stran@@ gers I guess is kind of dangerous .
if you '@@ re constantly seeking that it can lead to a br@@ ick wall .
I do Live at the A@@ pol@@ lo sometimes when I want to , but generally it does n@@ '@@ t float my boat like it used to .
I ask whether he '@@ ll ever do another stand@@ -up tour .
the joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning , middle and end of a journey - I do n@@ '@@ t think I '@@ ll ever want to give that up .
so this is his new incar@@ nation ?
I think so .
I like being an actor .
it '@@ s good fun .
you '@@ re always telling a story and that '@@ s a great place to be .
I love stories .
people love stories .
Kenya regist@@ ers civil servants to target ` gh@@ ost workers '
Kenya has started bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ically regist@@ ering all civil servants in an attempt to remove `` gh@@ ost workers '@@ ' from the government '@@ s payroll .
employees who failed to register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid , a government statement said .
the government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service .
President U@@ hur@@ u Ken@@ y@@ at@@ ta pledged to curb corruption in the public service after taking office in 2013 .
an aud@@ it earlier this year found that at least $ 1@@ m -LRB- £ 7@@ 00,000 -RRB- a month was lost in payments to `` gh@@ ost workers '@@ ' and other financial mal@@ practice .
the government suspects that salaries continue to be de@@ posi@@ ted into bank accounts , even after a person dies or leaves the public service , reports the BBC '@@ s W@@ any@@ ama Che@@ bu@@ si@@ ri from the capital , Nairobi .
all public servants are required to present themselves over the next two weeks at identification cent@@ res to ensure their data is captured through the bi@@ ome@@ tric regist@@ ration exercise , a government statement said .
anyone who failed to do so without a valid excuse would be eliminated from the payroll , it said .
`` This exercise will contribute significantly to the ration@@ alization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to clean@@ se the payroll at both levels of govern@@ ment@@ - hence bring a stop to the issue of ` gh@@ ost workers ' , '@@ ' said An@@ ne Wa@@ ig@@ uru , the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of de@@ vol@@ ution and Plan@@ ning .
tens of Turkish policemen arrested over ` plot@@ ting ' against G@@ ov@@ '@@ t
a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicions of ` plot@@ ting against the government ' , local media outlets say .
police officials have not immediately com@@ mented .
among the detainees were 14 high-@@ ranking officers , according to Hur@@ ri@@ yet Daily News .
some of them were involved in last December '@@ s corruption prob@@ es targeting government officials , including four government ministers .
in July a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly having set up an organized criminal gang and having tap@@ ped phone number .
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -LRB- who was Prime Minister back then -RRB- described their actions as part of activity conducted by Islamist cleric F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ul@@ len against him and others in power .
not all children back to school in Ukraine
schools across most of Ukraine re@@ opened their doors on M@@ ond@@ ay -LRB- September 1 -RRB- , after the summer holid@@ ays .
the day is traditionally a big one for families , and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Arsen@@ y Y@@ at@@ sen@@ yu@@ k took his daughter to school .
while there , he told waiting journalists that not all schools had re@@ opened , but that he was committed to defending the country for future generations :
the first of September ceremony was not held in every school .
there is not a peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of Ukraine , a huge joint Ukrainian '@@ s people '@@ s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
Alek@@ s@@ an Past@@ uk@@ hov , the head teacher of S@@ lavi@@ an@@ sk School , attended by Y@@ at@@ sen@@ yu@@ k '@@ s daughter , spoke in Russian .
we hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives .
the first day back at school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing emb@@ ro@@ id@@ ered shir@@ ts , carrying ballo@@ ons and giving flow@@ ers to their teachers .
in R@@ ona Fair@@ head , the BBC may have found the formidable chief it needs
she comes tra@@ iling clouds of glory from the world of banking , media management and the inner con@@ cla@@ ves of the T@@ ory party .
indeed , she has had front@@ line experience of her own .
her career began at global management consul@@ tants B@@ ain and Co , then progre@@ ssed via Morgan Stanley , Bom@@ b@@ adi@@ er , IC@@ I and the media world of Pear@@ sons .
she was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years , resig@@ ning when the top job at its parent company Pear@@ son '@@ s went to a junior male colleague .
her pa@@ y-@@ off is said to be close to £ 1 million .
her political rating is st@@ ur@@ dy , too .
she was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brow@@ ne , the former head of BP , when he was looking to bring private expertise into W@@ hi@@ teh@@ all : she became a cabinet office adviser .
her husband is a former T@@ ory counc@@ ill@@ or .
back in May , I described the chairman '@@ s job as a poisoned ch@@ al@@ ice .
not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is an inner paradox to its structure .
the trust faces in two directions : in@@ wards as the upper tier of the BBC '@@ s own management hierarchy , but also outw@@ ards as the voice of public concern and dis@@ quiet when things go aw@@ ry .
this is an almost untenable du@@ opo@@ ly calling for complete ro@@ ot@@ -and-@@ branch reform .
but what incoming chairman would risk coming in , cra@@ shing around and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dyna@@ sty in case they put themselves out of a job in the process .
it '@@ s a difficult call .
if that were n@@ '@@ t tough enough , plenty of people are keen to see the BBC cut down in size - its power , its finances and its status overha@@ uled .
as competitors circle ever closer and new technology challenges co@@ sy old certain@@ ties , the imminent negotiation of the L@@ ic@@ ence fee is fraught with e@@ special danger for the BBC .
for the modest sum of £ 14@@ 5.@@ 50 a year , the British public buys into what is surely the greatest media enterprise in the world .
the BBC tells a good story : it claims that its output reaches 96 per cent of households , and costs each one of them just 4@@ 0@@ p a day .
what '@@ s more , apparently the Be@@ eb '@@ s popularity is rising : 53 per cent support today as against 31 per cent 10 years ago .
patterns of watching and using the BBC have changed : I receive news headlines on my mobile phone these days , and catch up on missed program@@ mes with i@@ Pla@@ yer .
but it remains a much-@@ loved and formidable institution .
it needs a formidable chairman - I hope it has found one .
Texas ' Per@@ ry says Di@@ spar@@ aging T@@ we@@ et u@@ nau@@ th@@ ori@@ zed
a t@@ we@@ et from Republican Texas G@@ ov@@ . R@@ ick Per@@ ry '@@ s veri@@ fied account on Sunday night included a dispar@@ aging image of the Democratic district at@@ tor@@ ney who is at the center of his criminal indictment on charges of abuse of power .
the t@@ we@@ et was later dele@@ ted , followed by another from Per@@ ry '@@ s account that disa@@ vowed the post .
a t@@ we@@ et just went out from my account that was u@@ nau@@ th@@ ori@@ zed .
`` I do not con@@ done the t@@ we@@ et and I have taken it down , '@@ ' the later post said .
Per@@ ry aides did not immediately return messages seeking comment .
although the t@@ we@@ ets were sent from Per@@ ry '@@ s veri@@ fied account , it was unclear who does the actual post@@ ing for the feed .
the earlier t@@ we@@ et post@@ ed an un@@ flat@@ tering moc@@ k image of T@@ rav@@ is Coun@@ ty D@@ ist@@ ric@@ t At@@ tor@@ ney Ros@@ em@@ ary Le@@ hm@@ berg , who was convicted of dr@@ un@@ ken driving in April 2013 .
Per@@ ry veto@@ ed funds to her office when she refused to resign , which led to a grand jury in Aust@@ in this month indic@@ ting Per@@ ry - who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate .
the cap@@ tion on the t@@ we@@ et read@@ s : `` I do n@@ '@@ t always drive dr@@ unk at 3@@ x the legal blood alcohol limit ... but when I do , I indic@@ t G@@ ov@@ . Per@@ ry for calling me out about it . '@@ '
I am the most dr@@ unk Democrat in Texas .
Le@@ hm@@ berg '@@ s office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Per@@ ry .
it was handled by Michael McC@@ rum , a San An@@ toni@@ o-@@ based special prosecutor who was assigned by a Republican judge .
Per@@ ry has ple@@ aded not guilty and called the charges a political plo@@ y .
his high-@@ powered legal team has asked the judge over@@ seeing the case to dismiss the indictment , claiming that the law being used to prosecute the long@@ est-@@ serving governor in Texas history is un@@ constitu@@ tionally vague .
Per@@ ry cut off $ 7.@@ 5 million in state funds to the state '@@ s Public In@@ te@@ g@@ rity U@@ nit - which is based in T@@ rav@@ is Coun@@ ty and pro@@ secu@@ tes public corruption in Texas - when Le@@ hm@@ berg refused to resign .
that veto drew a formal compla@@ int from a left-@@ leaning watchdog group .
Per@@ ry '@@ s veri@@ fied account is up@@ dated frequently - and sometimes famously .
after fin@@ ishing in fifth place in the I@@ ow@@ a cau@@ c@@ uses during his 2012 presidential campaign , Per@@ ry addressed speculation that he might call it qu@@ its with a t@@ we@@ et of a photo of himself j@@ og@@ ging near a l@@ ake , and the words , `` H@@ ere we come South Ca@@ rol@@ ina !

Berkeley says housing market back to `` normal '@@ '
one of London '@@ s most prominent property develop@@ ers has warned that the housing market in sou@@ theast England has `` rever@@ ted '@@ ' to normal levels of activity .
homes in the capital have been the subject of red-@@ hot demand and surging prices , with widespread fears of a credit bubble prompting the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage borrowing in June .
Tony P@@ id@@ g@@ ley , founder and chairman of up@@ market house@@ buil@@ der Berkeley , on M@@ ond@@ ay said : `` Since the start of the current financial year , the market has rever@@ ted to normal transaction levels from the high point in 2013 , '@@ ' adding that this offered a `` stable operating environment . '@@ '
London '@@ s property market fa@@ red well during the downturn as foreign buyers p@@ iled into the capital .
prices in the city have le@@ ap@@ t 18@@ .@@ 5 per cent in the past year alone , according to Land Re@@ g@@ istry data , far out@@ stri@@ pping the 6.@@ 7 per cent average for England and W@@ ales as a whole .
average selling prices on Berkeley '@@ s private , affordable and student schemes have risen by about a fifth in the past year , reaching £ 4@@ 2@@ 3,000 at the end of April .
however , a strengthening pound has in recent months made London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential `` man@@ sion tax '@@ ' ahead of the general election next May .
London estate agent Fox@@ tons last week warned that April '@@ s mortgage Market Review , which introduced tougher lending rules , would also spark lower rates of market growth in both property sales transactions and prices during the second half of the year .
fresh data from the Bank of England on M@@ ond@@ ay showed a drop in the number of mortgage appro@@ val@@ s in July , further suggesting the housing market is cooling .
H@@ amp@@ tons International , another estate agent , has cut its 2015 forecast for London property price growth to 3 per cent on the basis that house price sentiment is already starting to weaken .
transaction volumes have meanwhile dropped by a quarter year on year in London '@@ s most expensive post@@ codes , such as Chelsea , May@@ fair and Ken@@ sing@@ ton , according to agent wa El@@ lis .
still , appetite for homes in the capital has been a boon to Berkeley , pushing up cash due on forward sales to more than £ 2.@@ 2@@ bn .
Mr P@@ id@@ g@@ ley added : `` demand for the right product with good design in the best locations has remained resilient and , reflecting this , forward sales have been maintained . '@@ '
in June the company reported it had sold 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007 .
annual pre-@@ tax profits rose 40 per cent year on year to £ 3@@ 8@@ 0@@ m , on revenues up 18 per cent to £ 1.@@ 6@@ bn .
speaking on M@@ ond@@ ay ahead of the company '@@ s annual meeting , Mr P@@ id@@ g@@ ley said Berkeley '@@ s earnings for the year were anticipated to be in line with current market expectations .
analy@@ st consensus is for full-@@ year pre-@@ tax profit of £ 4@@ 5@@ 0@@ m .
Berkeley shares were flat at £ 2@@ 3.@@ 96 in after@@ no@@ on London trading .
nu@@ de photos of J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence le@@ aked online by h@@ ack@@ er

nu@@ de photos of Osc@@ ar-@@ winning ac@@ tre@@ ss J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence have been le@@ aked online by a h@@ ack@@ er who claimed to have a `` master list '@@ ' of images of 100 other star@@ lets .

the authorities have been cont@@ acted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence .
the photos , which originally were post@@ ed on the ima@@ ge@@ -sharing site 4@@ ch@@ an , were purpor@@ tedly obtained through a weakness in Apple '@@ s i@@ C@@ loud online storage system , and a purpor@@ ted `` master list '@@ ' of the hac@@ king victims includes the names of dozens of female stars , including Ri@@ han@@ na , Kim Kar@@ da@@ shi@@ an , M@@ ary Eli@@ za@@ be@@ th W@@ instead and Mar@@ y-@@ K@@ ate Ol@@ sen , according to Bu@@ zz@@ Fe@@ ed .
it is not clear how many of the images are authentic , though `` Scot@@ t P@@ il@@ grim vs@@ . the World '@@ ' star W@@ instead took to Twitter to denounce the h@@ ack as well .

carried away by the day , K@@ ev@@ ern began to play at an imaginary pi@@ ano and in a ru@@ de@@ ly com@@ ic voice ser@@ en@@ ade A@@ il@@ in@@ n '@@ s big feet .
A@@ il@@ in@@ n did n@@ '@@ t understand .
`` It was a popular s@@ ong by a jaz@@ z pi@@ ani@@ st called fats Wal@@ ler , '@@ ' he told her , automatically putting two fingers to his li@@ ps .
this his father had always done to stifle the letter J before it left his li@@ ps .
it had begun as a game between them when he was small .
his father had played it with his own father , he '@@ d told him .
begin a word with a J without remembering to put two fingers across your mouth and it cost you a pen@@ ny .
it had not been much fun then and it was not much fun now .
he knew it was expected of him , that was all .
he had to explain what jaz@@ z was .
A@@ il@@ in@@ n had never heard any .
jaz@@ z , too , without exactly being pro@@ scri@@ bed , was n@@ '@@ t played .
improv@@ is@@ ation had fallen out of fashion .
there was room for only one `` if '@@ ' in life .
people wanted to be sure , when a tune began , exactly where it was going to end .
w@@ it , the same .
its un@@ predictability unsettled people '@@ s ner@@ ves .
and jaz@@ z was w@@ it expressed mus@@ ically .
though he reached the age of 10 without having heard of Sam@@ my Dav@@ is junior , K@@ ev@@ ern knew of jaz@@ z from his father '@@ s semi-@@ secret collection of old CD@@ s .
but at least he did n@@ '@@ t have to tell A@@ il@@ in@@ n that fats Wal@@ ler was black .
given her age , she was unlikely to have remembered a time when popular sing@@ ers were n@@ '@@ t black .
again , no laws or du@@ re@@ ss .
a comp@@ li@@ ant society meant that every section of it con@@ sented with gra@@ titude - the gra@@ titude of the provi@@ d@@ entially spared - to the principle of group ap@@ titude .
people of Afro@@ -@@ Caribbean origin were suited by temper@@ ament and physi@@ que to entertainment and athle@@ tics , and so they san@@ g and s@@ prin@@ ted .
people originally from the Indian sub@@ continent , electron@@ ically gi@@ fted as though by nature , undertook to ensure no family was without a functioning utility phone .
what was left of the Polish community plum@@ bed ; what was left of the Greek sma@@ shed pla@@ tes .
those from the Gulf States and the Lev@@ ant whose grand@@ parents had n@@ '@@ t quickly left the country while what happened , if IT happened was happening - fearing they '@@ d be accused of having stoked the fla@@ mes , fearing , indeed , that the fla@@ mes would consume them next - opened lab@@ ne@@ h and shi@@ sh@@ a-@@ pi@@ pe restaurants , kept their heads down , and grew depressed with id@@ len@@ ess .
to each according to his gifts .
having heard only bal@@ la@@ ds , A@@ il@@ in@@ n was hard pressed to understand how the insul@@ ting words K@@ ev@@ ern had just sung to her could ever have been set to music .
music was the expression of love .
`` They '@@ re not really insul@@ ting , '@@ ' K@@ ev@@ ern said .
except maybe to people whose feet are too big .
my father never insul@@ ted anybody , but he de@@ ligh@@ ted in this s@@ ong .
he was saying too much , but the gar@@ den '@@ s neglect gave the illusion of safety .
no word could get beyond the soun@@ d@@ pro@@ of@@ ing of the giant cab@@ b@@ age-@@ like leaves .
A@@ il@@ in@@ n still did n@@ '@@ t comprehend .
why would your father have loved something like that ?
he wanted to say it was a joke , but was reluctant , in her company , to put two fingers to his li@@ ps again .
she already thought he was strange .
`` It struck him as fun@@ ny , '@@ ' he said instead .
she sho@@ ok her head in dis@@ belief , bl@@ ot@@ ting out K@@ ev@@ ern '@@ s vision .
nothing to see in the whole wide world but her ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack of crow@@ -@@ black hair .
nothing else he wanted to see .
`` If you say so , '@@ ' she said , un@@ convinced .
but that still does n@@ '@@ t explain why you '@@ re sing@@ ing it to me .
she seemed in genuine distress .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet specifically , no .
your an@@ k@@ les , maybe , a bit ...
and you say you hate me because my an@@ k@@ les are too th@@ ick ?
hate you ?
of course I do n@@ '@@ t hate you .
that '@@ s just the sil@@ ly s@@ ong .
he could have said , `` I love you , '@@ ' but it was too soon for that .
`` Y@@ our th@@ ick an@@ k@@ les are the very reason I '@@ m attracted to you , '@@ ' he tried instead .
I '@@ m perverse that way .
it came out wrong .
he had meant it to be fun@@ ny .
meaning to be fun@@ ny often lan@@ ded him in a mess because , like his father , he lacked the reassuring char@@ m necessary to temp@@ er the cruelty that lur@@ ked in j@@ ok@@ es .
maybe his father intended to be cruel .
maybe he , K@@ ev@@ ern , did .
despite his kind eyes .
A@@ il@@ in@@ n Sol@@ om@@ ons flu@@ shed and rose from her dec@@ k@@ chair , kno@@ cking over the con@@ sole and spil@@ ling the w@@ ine they '@@ d been drinking .
El@@ der@@ f@@ lower w@@ ine , so drink was n@@ '@@ t his excuse .
in her ag@@ itation she seemed to tre@@ mble , like the fron@@ ds of a pal@@ m tree in a storm .
`` And your th@@ ick head '@@ s the very reason I '@@ m perver@@ sely attracted to you , '@@ ' she said ...
except that I '@@ m not .
he felt sorry for her , both on account of the unnecessary un@@ kin@@ dness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes in the moment of her standing up to him .
did she think he '@@ d strike her ?
she had n@@ '@@ t spoken to him about life on the chill northern archi@@ pe@@ la@@ go where she had grown up , but he did n@@ '@@ t doubt it was in all ess@@ entials similar to here .
the same vast and ic@@ y ocean crashed in on them both .
the same be@@ f@@ ud@@ dled men , even more thin@@ -@@ sk@@ in@@ ned and pe@@ ev@@ ish in the aftermath of what happened than their smugg@@ ler and wrec@@ ker ancestors had been , ro@@ amed ang@@ r@@ ily from pub to pub , ready to raise a hand to any woman who dared to refuse or tw@@ it them .
th@@ ick head ?
they '@@ d show her a th@@ ick fist , if she was n@@ '@@ t careful !
S@@ no@@ g her first - the s@@ no@@ g having become the most common expression of ero@@ tic irrit@@ ation between men and women ; an anti@@ dot@@ e to the b@@ land bal@@ la@@ ds of love the con@@ sole pumped out - s@@ no@@ g her first and cu@@ ff her later .
an unnecessary refin@@ ement in K@@ ev@@ ern '@@ s view , since a s@@ no@@ g was itself an act of thu@@ gg@@ ery .
A@@ il@@ in@@ n Sol@@ om@@ ons made a sign with her body for him to leave .
he heav@@ ed himself out of the dec@@ k@@ chair like an old man .
she felt lead@@ en herself , but the weight of his gri@@ ef surprised her .
this was n@@ '@@ t the end of the world .
they barely knew each other .
she watched him go - as at an up@@ sta@@ irs window her compani@@ on watched him go - a man made heavy by what he '@@ d brought on himself .
Adam leaving the gar@@ den , she thought .
she felt a pan@@ g for him and for men in general , no matter that some had raised their hands to her .
a man turned from her , his back bent , ash@@ amed , defeated , all the fight in him le@@ aked away - why was that a sight she felt she knew so well , when she could n@@ '@@ t recall a single instance , before today , of having seen it ?
alone again , A@@ il@@ in@@ n Sol@@ om@@ ons looked at her feet .
a score or so years before the events related above , E@@ s@@ me N@@ us@@ s@@ b@@ au@@ m , an intelligent and enthusiastic 3@@ 2-@@ year-old research@@ er employed by O@@ f@@ now , the non-@@ stat@@ ut@@ ory monitor of the Public Mo@@ od , prepared a short paper on the continu@@ ance of low@@ - and medium-@@ level violence in those very areas of the country where its reduction , if not its ces@@ sation , was most to have been expected , given the money and energy expen@@ ded on upro@@ oting it .
`` Mu@@ ch has been done , and much continues to be done , '@@ ' she wrote , `` to so@@ o@@ the the native aggres@@ siveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in those tw@@ ist@@ ed k@@ nar@@ ls and narrow cre@@ vices of the country where , though the spi@@ res of churches soar above the hed@@ ger@@ o@@ ws , the swe@@ e@@ ter breath of human kin@@ dness has , historically , been rarely felt .
but some qualities are proving to be in@@ eradic@@ able .
the higher the spire , it would seem , the lower the passions it goes on eng@@ end@@ ering .
the populace we@@ ep@@ s to senti@@ mental bal@@ la@@ ds , G@@ org@@ es on stories of adversity overcome , and profess@@ es to believe ard@@ ently in the virtues of marriage and family life , but not only does the old bru@@ ti@@ shness retain a per@@ tin@@ acious hold equally on rural communities as on our urban con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , evidence suggests the emergence of a new and vicious quar@@ rel@@ som@@ eness in the home , in the workplace , on our roads and even on our playing fields .
`` You have an unfortunate tendency to over@@ write , '@@ ' her supervis@@ or said when he had read the whole report .
may I suggest you read fewer nov@@ els .
E@@ s@@ me N@@ us@@ s@@ b@@ au@@ m lowered her head .
I must also en@@ qu@@ ire : are you an athe@@ ist ?
`` I believe I am not obliged to say , '@@ ' E@@ s@@ me N@@ us@@ s@@ b@@ au@@ m replied .
are you a les@@ bian ?
again E@@ s@@ me protested her right to privacy and silence .
a fem@@ inist ?
silence once more .
`` I do n@@ '@@ t ask , '@@ ' Luther R@@ abin@@ ow@@ it@@ z said at last , `` because I have an objection to athe@@ ism , les@@ bi@@ anism or femin@@ ism .
this is a prejud@@ ic@@ e-@@ free workplace .
we are the servants of a prejud@@ ic@@ e-@@ free society .
but certain kinds of hyper@@ sensitivity , while entirely acceptable and laud@@ able in themselves , may sometimes distort findings such as you have presented to me .
you are obviously yourself prejud@@ ic@@ ed against the church ; and those things you call `` vicious '@@ ' and `` bru@@ tish , '@@ ' others could as soon interpret as expressions of natural vig@@ our and vitality .
to still be har@@ ping on about what happened , if IT happened , as though it happened , if it happened , yesterday , is to s@@ ap the country of its essential life force .
E@@ s@@ me N@@ us@@ s@@ b@@ au@@ m looked around her while R@@ abin@@ ow@@ it@@ z spoke .
behind his head a fla@@ min@@ go p@@ ink led sc@@ roll repeated the advice O@@ f@@ now had been dispen@@ sing to the country for the last quarter of a century or more .
smile at your neighb@@ our , cheri@@ sh your spo@@ use , listen to bal@@ la@@ ds , go to mus@@ icals , use your telephone , conver@@ se , explain , listen , agree , apologi@@ se .
talk is better than silence , the sung word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
`` I fully understand the points you are making , '@@ ' E@@ s@@ me N@@ us@@ s@@ b@@ au@@ m replied in a quiet voice , once she was certain her supervis@@ or had finished speaking , `` and I am saying no more than that we are not heal@@ ed as effectively as we delu@@ de ourselves we are .
my concern is that , if we are not fore@@ warned , we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to what happened , if IT happened , in the first place .
only this time it will not be on others that we vent our anger and mistrust .
Luther R@@ abin@@ ow@@ it@@ z made a pyramid of his fingers .
this was to suggest infinite patience .
`` You go too far , '@@ ' he said , `` in describing as `` mistakes '@@ ' actions which our grand@@ parents might or might not have taken .
you go too far , as well , in speaking of them v@@ enting their `` anger '@@ ' and `` mistrust '@@ ' on `` others . '@@ '
it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past , as in protecting the present , we do not speak of `` us '@@ ' and `` them . '@@ '
there was no `` we '@@ ' and there were no `` others . '@@ '
it was a time of disorder , that is all we know of it .
`` In which , if we are honest with ourselves , '@@ ' E@@ s@@ me dared to inter@@ ject , `` no section of society can claim to have acqu@@ itted itself well .
I make no accusations .
whether it was done ill , or done well , what was done was done .
then was then .
no more needs to be said - on this we agree .
and just as there is no blame to be ap@@ por@@ tioned , so there are no am@@ ends to be made , were am@@ ends appropriate and were there any way of making them .
but what is the past for if not to learn from it -
the past exists in order that we forget it .
if I may add one word to that -
Luther R@@ abin@@ ow@@ it@@ z collapsed his pyramid .
`` I will consider your report , '@@ ' he said , dismis@@ sing her .
the next day , turning up for work as usual , she was kno@@ cked down by a motor@@ cyc@@ list who had mounted the pav@@ ement in what pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by described as a `` vicious rage . '@@ '

Les@@ o@@ th@@ o military says no coup planned ; P@@ M stays in South Africa
Les@@ o@@ th@@ o military officials denied stag@@ ing a coup to overthrow the government , saying they were acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics .
Prime Minister Thomas T@@ hab@@ ane fled the country , saying the country '@@ s military had surrounded his official home and seized government buildings in the capital of Mas@@ eru .
the premier took his family to neighboring South Africa after saying he received an assassination threat .
military spokes@@ man Maj@@ or N@@ tle@@ le N@@ to@@ i said there was not , in fact , a coup , but that the military was responding to a threat from `` political fanatics '@@ ' whom police were attempting to arm .
`` What happened this morning was that the command of the Les@@ o@@ th@@ o Defense Force was acting after receiving several intelligence reports that am@@ ong@@ st the police service , there are some elements who are actually planning to arm some of the political , party political youth fanatics who were on the verge of w@@ reak@@ ing havoc , '@@ ' he told Vo@@ ice of America .
South African government spokes@@ man Cla@@ ys@@ on Mon@@ y@@ ela said the military '@@ s actions had the appearance at an overthrow .
`` Al@@ though no one has claimed to have taken over government through the use of force , by all accounts the activities of the Les@@ o@@ th@@ o defense force thus far bear the hall@@ marks of a coup d@@ '@@ et@@ at , '@@ ' he said .
Les@@ o@@ th@@ o military officials said soldiers returned to their bar@@ ra@@ cks Sunday and there was calm in the capital .
meanwhile , Deputy Prime Minister Mo@@ the@@ t@@ jo@@ a Met@@ sing in control of the government in T@@ hab@@ ane '@@ s absence .
T@@ hab@@ ane said he believes he is being targeted due to his attempt to fight corruption in the country .
tensions have been high in Les@@ o@@ th@@ o since June when T@@ hab@@ ane suspended parliament sessions due to feud@@ ing in his unity government .
he said his actions have not undermined the government , despite allegations otherwise .
eurozone manufacturing at 13@@ -@@ month low
manufacturing growth in the eurozone slowed to a 13@@ -@@ month low in August , according to a clo@@ sel@@ y-@@ watched survey .
the final Mar@@ k@@ it '@@ s Euroz@@ one manufacturing purchasing managers ' Index -LRB- P@@ M@@ I -RRB- di@@ pped to 5@@ 0.7 in August , down from 5@@ 1.8 in July .
a figure above 50 indicates expansion .
new orders dwind@@ led and factories suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
the figures come ahead of the European Central Bank -LRB- ECB -RRB- meeting on T@@ hur@@ sday .
markets will be looking for a clear plan from the bank to deal with a stalled eurozone recovery , as well as the threat of deflation with inflation standing at just 0.3 % .
there is speculation that ECB boss Mario Draghi could offer further indications later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone , similar to those taken by the UK and US during the financial crisis .
`` Al@@ though some growth is better than no growth at all , the bra@@ king effect of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers is becoming more visible , '@@ ' said Rob D@@ ob@@ son , senior economist at Mar@@ k@@ it .
the factory P@@ M@@ I for Germany , Russia '@@ s biggest trade partner in the EU , fell to an 1@@ 1-@@ month low of 5@@ 1.4 .
meanwhile , in the bloc '@@ s second-@@ largest economy , France , the P@@ M@@ I fell to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
France remains a real concern , as does Italy '@@ s descent from solid expansion to stagnation .
signs that growth impetus wan@@ ed in the key industrial engine of Germany , and in Spain and the Netherlands too , is also less than reassuring , '@@ ' Mr D@@ ob@@ son said .
the slowdown in industry is likely to add further fuel to the fire for analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented .
one positive note was from the Republic of Ireland , which saw its P@@ M@@ I grow to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , its highest level since the end of 1999 .
H@@ ow@@ ard Ar@@ cher , chief economist at I@@ H@@ S Global insight , said : `` The best that can be said for the August eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers ' survey is that it indicates that the sector is still growing . '@@ '
he added : `` Euroz@@ one manufacturers are clearly finding life very difficult at the moment as current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly related to Russi@@ a@@ /@@ Ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries .
this heightened uncertainty has clearly hit business - especially , and consumer confidence , and it is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even cancel@@ led , particularly big-@@ ticket orders .
he said it was looking `` ever more likely '@@ ' that the ECB would ultimately have to undertake some form of QE , `` although we suspect that it will be limited . '@@ '
the Bes@@ lan survivors ' decade of hell : ten years since the horrific school siege , how the children caught up in it are still suffering
ten years ago over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Bes@@ lan , southern Russia
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day or@@ deal that shocked the world
we went back to Bes@@ lan to find some of the victims who che@@ ated death in the class@@ room atro@@ city
exactly a decade after the appalling Bes@@ lan school siege in which 3@@ 34 peri@@ shed , including 18@@ 6 children , the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalyp@@ se in Ukraine .
when fana@@ tic Islamic terrorists kidna@@ pped and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004 , at the start of a new term , it seemed like the na@@ di@@ r of all evil .
the tragedy united east and west in revulsion , which amazingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the di@@ rest misery .
ten years on , we went back to Bes@@ lan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who che@@ ated death in the class@@ room atro@@ city .
we discovered amazing young people , who have de@@ fied adversity , though the memory of this terrorist hell will live with them forever .
their greatest hope ?
that the war now scar@@ ring Ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop .
the girl pic@@ tured trying to climb back inside the bli@@ t@@ zed school gy@@ m
she was famously sna@@ pped by top Russian photograph@@ er Dmitry B@@ eli@@ ak@@ ov wearing only her under@@ wear as tried to climb back inside the bli@@ t@@ zed school gy@@ m after a mine exploded .
be@@ wil@@ dered , A@@ ida was desperately searching for her mother , L@@ aris@@ sa , now 40 .
both were feared dead , but in fact they survived .
` A woman told me to run for my life but I could n@@ '@@ t , ' said A@@ ida at the time .
my leg@@ s were covered in blood .
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mum .
a soldier plu@@ cked her to safety .
after a series of sur@@ ger@@ ies , she thought she had totally recovered but said yesterday : ` Three months ago , the pain came back .
I fear I may need more surgery .
some sh@@ rap@@ nel pieces are still in my kne@@ e .
her aim now is to become a d@@ enti@@ st , to help people as she has been aided by med@@ ics .
` This tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it , ' she said defi@@ antly .
` It happened to me and you ca n@@ '@@ t change this fact .
once a year I always go to the gy@@ m to recall those who remained there .
my friends and I try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too much .
my best friend and my class@@ mate@@ -to-@@ be D@@ zer@@ a Ga@@ po@@ ev@@ a was killed there .
we played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together .
` I do n@@ '@@ t want to mar@@ ry until I finish my studies and start my career .
I will think about a family later .
she says the siege remains with her though memories fade a little each year .
I am ple@@ ased that many people in the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere .
when I see online the photogra@@ ph of me clim@@ bing into the school window , I think that many people will see it for the first time , understand about our disaster , and stop this from happening any more .
the boy who fled through a hail of bullets believing his mother to be dead
he was on his first day at school -LRB- Russians start school aged 7 -RRB- and survived the three day siege hu@@ gging his mum Tam@@ ara .
then seven he said : ` mu@@ m@@ my told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand . '
after one explosion he thought she was dying .
she told him : ` R@@ un ' .
fearing she was dead , he fled and on his way he saw a c@@ rying tod@@ d@@ ler , grab@@ bed the child by the hand , and fled through a hail of bullets .
his dad Vladimir , who sco@@ op@@ ed up his son outside , said : ` Dam@@ ir told me his mother had died .
he said : ` I could n@@ '@@ t save her ' . '
in fact , Tam@@ ara had stum@@ bled free and was in hospital with leg wounds , in turn believing her son had peri@@ shed .
after their re@@ union she said : ` I we@@ pt with joy .
I could n@@ '@@ t believe it .
he ran in and hu@@ gged me .
Dam@@ ir was later flo@@ wn to London -LRB- by the now de@@ fun@@ ct News of the World newspaper -RRB- to be crow@@ ned a Bar@@ nar@@ do '@@ s Chil@@ dren '@@ s champion by then premier Tony Blair and wife wife Ch@@ erie .
` This horror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop recal@@ ling it , ' he said yesterday .
still I can say that in my mind it is fading .
I remember right afterwards , I threw away all my to@@ y guns .
but now I can play computer games with shooting and it is not a problem for me .
` I '@@ m not scared to go back in the gy@@ m but I do n@@ '@@ t think about myself .
I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard who never got out .
we never say they were killed or dead .
we say they stayed in the gy@@ m .
I remember my trip to London so well , specially the to@@ y shop where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted , and riding in an open top car .
but now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misery he and his friends suffered .
this horror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop recal@@ ling it
` I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors , ' said Dam@@ ir , who was last week doing voluntary work at a n@@ un@@ ner@@ y .
I want to help so much .
I want to serve in the police one day and hope they en@@ ro@@ l me to the training ac@@ ade@@ my next year .
his mother Tam@@ ara , 48 , said : ` 37 kids were killed in our neighb@@ our@@ hood , can you imagine ?
I remember terrible silence right after the siege , there were just no children to sh@@ out and run around , and that silence lasted for many months .
she vi@@ vid@@ ly recal@@ ls her trip with Dam@@ ir to London .
people in London were c@@ rying when I told our story .
I real@@ ised then how fol@@ k on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , can show their support .
she was grateful to ` Ch@@ erie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004 .
I wish I could call Ch@@ erie and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London , and how that helped Dam@@ ir and me .
I remember when Dam@@ ir wanted to eat bor@@ sch soup , they called all the local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he was playing with wa@@ it@@ ers in a restaurant , Dam@@ ir was shooting at them from his water p@@ ist@@ ol and they ran away and played with him .
and we were just one month away from our horror then .
I was amaz@@ ed that the British people were so ready to share our pain and to support us .
she said : ` I keep thinking this world did not get better within these 10 years .
now in Ukraine the war goes on , people are dying every day , and I believe many children were killed and will be killed .
they are just the same children , like ours .
I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bored or busy with something else .
I just know what those people feel , the horror of it .
and I ca n@@ '@@ t stop feeling it .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and it is so sad .
Dam@@ ir grew up and became a very gent@@ le and calm boy , he is not at all aggressive or angry .
he is not seeking revenge for example , he is not preoccupied with this past horror .
I know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six class@@ mates and they go to the gy@@ m from time to time and light cand@@ les there .
when he was smaller he suffered from it - I remember he used to lie down on the sof@@ a with his face turned away from us , for hours at a time .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he threw away all his guns and other ar@@ my@@ -@@ type to@@ ys@@ .@@ Dam@@ ir is 17 now , tal@@ ler than me , nice looking , clever and healthy .
I can hardly believe that for some hours I was so sure he was dead and I '@@ d never see him again .
when I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around , I saw the hell around me , when body parts were lying everywhere .
I was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survived in this hell .
` I remember I was sh@@ ou@@ ting to him ` Dam@@ ir , run , run away ' but again I was so sure he had not heard me .
but he did hear , and he did run away .
so life goes on for us unlike for so many .
Georg@@ y I@@ ly@@ in , 17
the boy whose shocking image after the siege came to define the horror of Bes@@ lan
comfort : Bes@@ lan surviv@@ or Georg@@ y I@@ ly@@ in with his mum Fa@@ tim@@ a after the siege in 2004 , while on the right is Georg@@ y today
his blood@@ sta@@ ined face was et@@ ched with fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists gun@@ ned down his class@@ mates .
his picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbar@@ ity at Bes@@ lan .
his mother Fa@@ tim@@ a , 54 , a senior GP , had dropped him for his first day at school before rushing to take her el@@ der son Vladimir to university .
` I left two minutes before the terrorists rushed into the yard , so my little boy was left there alone for three days of horror , ' she recal@@ led .
not completely alone , we had a family of relatives there but all of them were killed .
only my Georg@@ y managed to survive .
the closer this date is , the harder it is to think and talk about it .
there is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy .
we do not feel it was long ago , I think it happened yesterday , some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time .
nobody will ever forget , I promise you .
ha@@ unting : the image of Georg@@ y -LRB- left -RRB- was one of the most shocking of the attack and has been im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ised in a stat@@ ue -LRB- right -RRB-
I remember Georg@@ y so much wanted to go to school on that day , he said he wanted to hu@@ g his teacher .
I only got to know he was alive when I saw him TV .
and now there is even a stat@@ ue to c@@ rying Georg@@ y in San Mar@@ ino .
Georg@@ y does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the book@@ case in our home .
I understand , but I also think that thanks to this picture people from all over the world feel our pain .
Georg@@ y says now : ` It '@@ s important this can never happen again .
` I doubt we '@@ ll ever know the truth .
people keep investig@@ ating such trag@@ edies and never know the truth .
now they are investig@@ ating this Boeing crash in Ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is moving to something very bad .
` I ca n@@ '@@ t understand how it happens , because if you ask people , no-@@ one wants a war , so how does it happen ?
ten years is nothing for such pain .
we need dozens of years to pass in order to forget it a little .
it affected my health and I still feel it .
for about three or four years I had some night@@ ma@@ res because of the siege but then it got better .
I got back to school later in 2004 , I was very scared every day .
I was thinking about my friends and class@@ mates who were killed .
this is why I keep going to the gy@@ m as each 1 September approaches .
I want to pay tribu@@ te to my old childhood friends .
it is hard for me to go inside the gy@@ m but I must do it .
I do not feel myself a victim , this story is the part of my past now .
I will not forget it but I do not feel sorry for myself .
my life goes on .
I finished school this year entered a medical university in Vla@@ dik@@ av@@ kaz .
I will learn to be a heart sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was to go in the army .
I wanted to be a military man , but my health did not let me .
I wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen .

miracul@@ ous : Georg@@ y Far@@ ni@@ yev was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege but still managed to survive
as the siege was underway , he was pic@@ tured trapped inside the gy@@ m , sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is truly a miracle he was not killed .
` We feel as if it was just yesterday , ' said Georg@@ y , who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the FSB , but was unable to because of damage to his health in the siege .
it is still with me , this is not something I left behind .
I am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - I must say this is not true .
` In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I did feel a bit better afterwards but I ca n@@ '@@ t forget it .
and I would like to forget .
2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the gy@@ m again .
I lost consciousness .
I would never ever go there again and please do n@@ '@@ t ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture .
surviv@@ or : Georg@@ y Far@@ ni@@ ev pic@@ tured today , with a photogra@@ ph of him in hospital fol@@ l@@ wo@@ ing the siege on his lap@@ top
my pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day .
my friends know that I do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school .
in terms of physical condition I am well .
I should be careful with my kne@@ e which was injured but I walk fine now .
still my health did not let me go and study in FSB secret service ac@@ ade@@ my in S@@ t Petersburg as I wanted .
I sent my documents , including medical papers , and they replied it was not possible .
my second passion was animals , so I went to the veter@@ inary in@@ stitute .
I have completed two years there .
he is learning to treat all animals ` from cats to co@@ ws ' .
he said : ` I know I would never tell my children about my experience .
this is not something children should know about , and of course not something they should experience .
his mother Mar@@ ina , 42 , said : ` This pain never leaves me .
it is in my soul , worse when the anniversary gets close .
I will go and attend cerem@@ on@@ ies being held to mark it .
I know Georg@@ y wo n@@ '@@ t go .
it must be even stronger for him because he was there and I was not .
I was waiting for him at home , not able to help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me@@ .@@ H@@ ere in Bes@@ lan the im@@ print is on everyone .
it stays with us .
Georg@@ y is an adult now but that horror is still with him .
it is hard to accept it when something so terri@@ bly unfair happens to you .
he is a boy , he likes sports but he ca n@@ '@@ t take part because of his kne@@ e .
he had several sur@@ ger@@ ies , he walks but can not exercise .
I would say he 50 % over@@ came this horror , but one can never completely overcome and forget it .
this horrible experience will stay with us .
many friends and neighb@@ ours were killed in the siege , and it only adds to my pain .
I lost many people I knew well and they were dear for me .
my son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed .
I know families where new children were born , but also wi@@ dows who never married again .
it is hard to accept that life goes on , even if you do not want it .
I will never forget my heart ju@@ mping out of my ch@@ est at the moment I saw him in hospital .
now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions .
what are those people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it .
we used to be one friendly country in the past , how did it happen that we are fighting now ?
people and children are suffering , I am sure many children were already killed in Ukraine and many will be killed .
if we could only grab all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as possible .

the world ga@@ sp@@ ed in 2004 when baby A@@ ly@@ ona was carried out of the Bes@@ lan siege c@@ rad@@ led in the arms of a Russian policeman .
terrorists let her go but cru@@ el@@ ly kept her 30 year old mother , ten year old older sister K@@ rist@@ ina , and brother Mak@@ h@@ ar in the school gy@@ m .
Mak@@ h@@ ar , then three , escaped , but A@@ ly@@ ona '@@ s mother and sister died in the murderous carnage .
her father Rus@@ lan has since re@@ married and with his new wife S@@ vet@@ lana he has a baby girl , who he named K@@ rist@@ ina after the daughter he lost .
A@@ ly@@ ona , now ten , has no memory of the siege and has blo@@ ss@@ omed into a bright and happy girl , say neighb@@ ours .
` They are a big happy family now and A@@ ly@@ ona and Mak@@ h@@ ar are both great kids , ' said a close friend .
Rus@@ lan is a fanta@@ stic dad and wants to get them away from all the memories as the tenth anniversary is marked .
you can understand why .
man accused of kno@@ cking down girl on Fi@@ fe pe@@ li@@ can crossing
a 7@@ 8-@@ year-old man is to stand trial accused of running over a three-@@ year-old girl on a pe@@ li@@ can crossing in Fi@@ fe .
Gordon Ste@@ war@@ t is alleged to have kno@@ cked down the girl on a crossing in P@@ it@@ ten@@ we@@ en in East Neu@@ k .

4 ti@@ ps for better under@@ water photos and video
if you '@@ re interested in shooting photos or video under@@ water , you have a variety of equipment choices .
the cheap@@ est option is a water@@ proof poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ shoot , such as the Nik@@ on Co@@ ol@@ pi@@ x A@@ W@@ 120 or an action ca@@ m , such as the Go@@ P@@ ro H@@ ero@@ 3@@ + silver edi@@ tion , which both go for around $ 300 .
I shot these photos at a family party using several cameras , all priced under $ 350 .
no matter what ge@@ ar you use , a few rules apply for getting the best results .
D@@ oub@@ le-@@ check your ge@@ ar .
even if you have a water@@ proof camer@@ a , make sure that the camer@@ a '@@ s battery and other com@@ partments are tightly closed .
also , set your camer@@ a to match the type of photos or video you '@@ ll be shooting .
some cameras and cam@@ c@@ orders have scene or shooting modes that will opti@@ mi@@ ze the exposure for dim under@@ sea sett@@ ings .
and before you jump in , know how deep your equipment can go .
some cameras are rated to only 5 feet , others to 50 or 60 feet .
check out our buying guide and Rat@@ ings for digital cameras for both conventional and water@@ proof models .
take multiple sh@@ ots - because many of them wo n@@ '@@ t work .
Po@@ in@@ t-@@ and-@@ shoot cameras have L@@ CD@@ s to help you com@@ pose photos , while action c@@ ams generally do n@@ '@@ t .
even if you have an L@@ CD , it '@@ s going to hard to see it under@@ water , and com@@ posing your shot will be a h@@ it-@@ or-@@ miss process .
so shoot multi@@ ples .
also , if your camer@@ a has a bra@@ ck@@ et mode , which shoots a burst of sh@@ ots at slightly different exposure sett@@ ings , take advantage of it .
stay near the surface .
light falls off dramatically the deeper you di@@ ve under@@ water .
if possible , stay close to the surface when you shoot in a pool , a l@@ ake or the ocean .
this will also allow you to capture more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you '@@ ll see .
get close to your subjects .
this is great advice for shooting on dry land , but it is even more important under@@ water because of the dim ligh@@ ting conditions .
it '@@ s particularly important if you '@@ re shooting with an action ca@@ m : these devices often have a fixed , wide angle len@@ s , which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the picture frame .
Andrew L@@ aw@@ son was the kind of man whose force of personality could shake things up , even in a gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an organis@@ ation like the N@@ H@@ S .
a consul@@ tant ana@@ es@@ the@@ tist , he devoted his career to spar@@ ing the sick both the agon@@ ies of illness and the tor@@ ments of treatment .
among those who sought him out , his wife re@@ members , was an M@@ I@@ 6 officer who had to live with the crippling after@@ -@@ effects of torture .
L@@ aw@@ son understood that while doctors are cap@@ tiv@@ ated by diagnos@@ es and diseases , those being treated are overwhelmingly concerned with something else entirely : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one who began to suffer .
`` I have not felt myself , '@@ ' he wrote in May that year .
I '@@ ve had difficulty in energ@@ ising myself .
struggling with flu@@ -like symptoms , he found himself im@@ pati@@ ently ber@@ ating his wife , Juli@@ et .
`` I want everything to happen sooner rather than later , '@@ ' he noted .
when Juli@@ et went away on business for a week , L@@ aw@@ son found himself unusually , and unac@@ coun@@ tably , upset .
something was up .
he got a colleague to perform a ch@@ est X-@@ ray .
just two weeks earlier he had been ski@@ ing in the French Al@@ ps .
the results of the X-@@ ray came back .
he had mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma , an inc@@ u@@ rable cancer that affects the ple@@ ura , or lining of the l@@ ung .
with most cancers , it is hard to know the exact cause .
though some smo@@ kers get l@@ ung cancer , for example , not all l@@ ung cancer suff@@ er@@ ers have smo@@ ked .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma is different .
in almost every case , the cause is exposure to as@@ besto@@ s - a fi@@ bro@@ us building material once dubbed `` miracul@@ ous , '@@ ' but now known to be mort@@ ally dangerous .
for most of us , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma has been an easy disease to ignore .
as@@ besto@@ s , after all , is a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of as@@ besto@@ s has not been used in Britain since the 1960s , when a voluntary industry ban came into effect .
even when it was used , only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pi@@ pe lagg@@ ers , builders , car@@ pen@@ ters and Shi@@ py@@ ard workers , for example .
an industrial tox@@ in from another era , it hardly seems cause for concern today .
but such complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it turns out , is today at the peak of a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma epidemic .
there are more mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma deaths here than in any other country on the planet .
with an annual toll of about 2,@@ 500 , more than twice as many people die of the disease as die in accidents in motor vehicles .
Mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma annual deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Great Britain
the reason that we are feeling its deadly effects now is that , though as@@ besto@@ s use has been illegal for years -LRB- all types of as@@ besto@@ s were eventually banned by law in 1999 -RRB- , it usually takes decades for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma to develop .
and the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma scourge is not confined to veterans of industrial building jobs .
as@@ besto@@ s has been , and in many cases still is , embedded in the homes we live in , the offices we work in , the schools we are educated in , and the stores we shop in .
as a result , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma is no respec@@ ter of class , wealth , occupation , or age .
the bast@@ i@@ ons of privilege , from smart London department stores to public schools , have proved no refuge .
the H@@ ous@@ es of Parliament are rid@@ dled with as@@ besto@@ s .
even the hospitals that are meant to make us better have been reservo@@ irs of this deadly car@@ cin@@ og@@ en .
Andrew L@@ aw@@ son was not old .
nor was he a pi@@ pe lagg@@ er .
in fact , he struggled to think where he might have come into contact with as@@ besto@@ s .
then he put his finger on it .
`` It seems that there may have been a lot of as@@ besto@@ s in the tun@@ ne@@ ls at Gu@@ y '@@ s Ho@@ sp@@ ital where I spent six years training , '@@ ' he wrote .
everybody - students , nur@@ ses , doctors and por@@ ters - used the tun@@ ne@@ ls .
one wonders how many of my con@@ tempor@@ aries will get the same disease ?
it was a question to which , sadly , he was able to provide a partial answer .
`` O@@ f four doctors who trained at Gu@@ y '@@ s Ho@@ sp@@ ital and who subsequently developed mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma in the past five years , '@@ ' he noted in a letter in 2010 , `` I am the only one left alive . '@@ '
how many of us will get this disease ?
Andrew L@@ aw@@ son was diagnosed with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma when he was 48 .
when he died , on February 17 this year , he was 55 .
to survive so long is unusual .
fifty per cent of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers are dead 8 months after diagnosis .
it is always fatal .
so now we can only echo L@@ aw@@ son '@@ s question : `` How many of us will get the same disease ? '@@ '
according to Britain '@@ s leading expert on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma , Profess@@ or Juli@@ an Pe@@ to , our best guess is that between 1970 and 2050 , when the as@@ besto@@ s epidemic in Britain should have played itself out , some 9@@ 0,000 people will have died .
most currently have no idea that they will die this way .

a quick glance at the reports from the courts , where those affected often turn for compensation , shows how far the scourge of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma has spread .
this June , for example , Mar@@ ks & Spen@@ cer admitted negli@@ gently exposing Jan@@ ice Al@@ len to as@@ besto@@ s .
she worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 , supervis@@ ing clothes sections at two sites - one of which was the fla@@ g@@ ship store on Oxford Street .
M@@ rs Al@@ len was only 18 when she started working at M & S .
now she has two children in their 20@@ s .
`` Be@@ fore this happened , '@@ ' she says , `` I had never heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma , I barely knew about as@@ besto@@ s .
I never would have dreamed that I would be affected by it .
few people do know much about as@@ besto@@ s .
in fact , as@@ besto@@ s describes not one substance but a group of six miner@@ als .
they get their name from the word `` as@@ be@@ sti@@ form '@@ ' - which describes the fi@@ bro@@ us structure which en@@ dows them with strength and flexibility .
of the six , three have commonly been used in the building trade .
Ch@@ ry@@ so@@ tile , commonly known as White as@@ besto@@ s , is by far the most frequently found in buildings today .
it was used in ro@@ of@@ ing panels , floor ti@@ les , pi@@ pe insu@@ lation , bo@@ il@@ er se@@ als , even bra@@ ke lin@@ ings in cars .
it is less lethal than other forms of as@@ besto@@ s , but it '@@ s still considered a `` major health hazard '@@ ' that can kill by the EU and WHO .
more dangerous , however , are Brown as@@ besto@@ s -LRB- amo@@ site -RRB- and Blu@@ e as@@ besto@@ s -LRB- cro@@ ci@@ do@@ li@@ te -RRB- .
Britain was once the world '@@ s largest impor@@ ter of Brown as@@ besto@@ s , and experts suggest that `` there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major cause of the uniquely high mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma rate -LSB- in the UK -RSB- . '@@ '
a Mar@@ ks & Spen@@ cer employee was exposed to as@@ besto@@ s at its fla@@ g@@ ship store in Oxford Street , London A@@ la@@ my
Jan@@ ice Al@@ len may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma , but Juli@@ an Pe@@ to '@@ s work suggests that her story is far from un@@ common .
he has produced a study of suff@@ er@@ ers which suggests that `` a substantial proportion of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ as with no known O@@ c@@ cup@@ ational or domestic exposure were probably caused by environmental as@@ besto@@ s exposure . '@@ '
much of that exposure , he says , is due to `` normal occupation and wea@@ thering '@@ ' of our buildings .
no one , it seems , can be sure that they are safe .
a report from G@@ od@@ d@@ ard Con@@ sul@@ ting , which looked at the Pal@@ ace of West@@ min@@ ster , shows how people , even in the heart of government , might have been exposed una@@ wa@@ res .
in 2009 G@@ od@@ d@@ ard reported that service sh@@ af@@ ts and pi@@ ping du@@ cts behind Parli@@ ament@@ ary committee rooms were contaminated with as@@ besto@@ s , whose lethal fi@@ b@@ res could be disturbed by something as inno@@ cu@@ ous as `` strong currents of air . '@@ '
MPs are frequently accused of looking after their own interests , but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true .
while the Parli@@ ament@@ ary Wor@@ ks Services Direc@@ torate insisted that the Pal@@ ace of West@@ min@@ ster had been given `` a clean bill of health , '@@ ' it is now accepted £ 1@@ bn of work lasting several years is required to overhaul Parliament , up@@ grading electr@@ ics and removing as@@ besto@@ s , and that after the 2015 general election MPs may sit in the nearby Q@@ E@@ 2 Conference Cent@@ re rather than on the Green ben@@ ches at West@@ min@@ ster .
the G@@ od@@ d@@ ard report noted that `` the presence of as@@ besto@@ s has not been managed in accordance with the various regulations . '@@ '
it is impossible to know if this mismanagement will cost lives .
all anyone can do now is wait .
one person who has never been able to pin@@ point his exposure to as@@ besto@@ s is Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t , a GP .
like Andrew L@@ aw@@ son , Ab@@ bot@@ t , 50 , suspects that he was exposed to as@@ besto@@ s while working in hospitals .
`` I have worked at a hospital where positive as@@ besto@@ s claims have been made , '@@ ' he says , `` But I ca n@@ '@@ t prove it in my case .
it '@@ s so hard to remember all the places one has worked in , and the dates .
what he re@@ members clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fever .
he was 45 , and in the middle of a late evening surgery .
suddenly I started feeling shi@@ very .
it came on very quickly .
I felt dreadful .
I did n@@ '@@ t think I was going to be able to drive all the way home .
being a doctor , Ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain was coming from the ple@@ ura , the lining around his lun@@ gs .
but like Jan@@ ice Al@@ len , he simply had no reason to suspect mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma .
he ended up spending a month off work .
puzz@@ led doctors gave him ch@@ est X-@@ ra@@ ys , and administered ple@@ ural ca@@ the@@ ters to draw off fluid from the lun@@ gs and send it for assessment .
yet the condition went un@@ diagnosed .
slowly his health improved and he went back to work .
but from time to time the same symptoms returned , often after he took exercise and was breathing hard .
in 2011 , one of Ab@@ bot@@ t '@@ s patients arrived at his GP '@@ s surgery with similar symptoms to him , and was subsequently diagnosed with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma .
but even then Ab@@ bot@@ t did n@@ '@@ t make the connection with his own case .
after all , his patient was decades older , and had worked directly as@@ besto@@ s .
the link in that case was clear .
in September 2011 , Ab@@ bot@@ t '@@ s condition worsened again , and his consul@@ tant took his C@@ T sc@@ ans and X-@@ ra@@ ys to a panel of experts .
in December 2011 , exactly two years after Ab@@ bot@@ t started feeling un@@ well , a pro@@ be , equipped with a camer@@ a , was fed into the cav@@ ity between the lining of his ch@@ est and the lining of his l@@ ung .
I '@@ m an opti@@ mist .
I tend just to plo@@ d along , '@@ ' he says .
I had n@@ '@@ t worried about it too much to be honest .
but R@@ ach@@ el , my wife , was worrying .
the result of the biop@@ sy came in the week between Christmas and New Year : `` I was told it was mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma . '@@ '
Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t : diagnosed with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma
suddenly Ab@@ bot@@ t was plunged into meetings with Mac@@ mil@@ lan nur@@ ses , one of whom suggested that he should get in touch with a lawyer .
that was when he real@@ ised the scale of the epidemic .
`` It turns out that as@@ besto@@ s was widely used , particularly in big public buildings which quite often had as@@ besto@@ s lagging on the pi@@ pes , '@@ ' he says .
people who were exposed to as@@ besto@@ s in those buildings are now coming down with the disease .
so mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma is now affecting younger people not in the typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous as@@ besto@@ s-@@ lagged pi@@ pes in hospitals were below ground level , so patients are unlikely to have been affected .
but many staff , walking in pedestri@@ an tun@@ ne@@ ls to get from one building to another -LRB- like Andrew L@@ aw@@ son -RRB- , or eating in bas@@ ement c@@ ante@@ ens -LRB- as Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t frequently did -RRB- almost certainly did come into contact with the toxic substance .
for several decades after the war , it turns out , hospitals were potentially life-@@ saving places for patients , but life-@@ threatening places for the doctors who treated them .
it is still being removed today .
pup@@ ils per@@ ched their B@@ un@@ sen bur@@ ners on as@@ besto@@ s mat@@ s
and it is not just hospitals .
as@@ besto@@ s was frequently used in offices , shops , libr@@ aries and town hal@@ ls for its mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous insu@@ lating and fla@@ me-@@ re@@ tar@@ ding properties .
schools too .
in fact many people will have been first exposed to as@@ besto@@ s in the class@@ room .
up and down the country , in myriad chemistry lessons , pup@@ ils have per@@ ched their B@@ un@@ sen bur@@ ners on as@@ besto@@ s mat@@ s .
web@@ sites have spr@@ ung up to address the issue of as@@ besto@@ s in schools .
meanwhile , in our homes , items as inno@@ cu@@ ous as floor ti@@ les or shed ro@@ of@@ s have routinely contained as@@ besto@@ s .
`` It '@@ s an industrial poison built into large amounts of our housing stock , '@@ ' notes Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew L@@ aw@@ son in his case against Gu@@ y '@@ s Ho@@ sp@@ ital .
in one case the only contact the woman suff@@ er@@ er could think of was pulling down a gar@@ den shed in the 1970s .
so be careful how you pull down the gar@@ den shed .
the impact of diagnosis , knowing that the disease is inc@@ u@@ rable , is huge .
`` It takes a while to sink in , '@@ ' says Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t .
I went back to work and tried to carry on but real@@ ised that I could n@@ '@@ t concentrate on what I was doing .
I was at the surgery for two weeks .
then I real@@ ised that I would have to leave and sort myself out .
well , I wo n@@ '@@ t see Christmas again
one of the hardest things was moving from the position of doctor to that of patient .
like countless patients before him , he re@@ members feeling be@@ wil@@ dered by the amount of information to get to grips with .
`` It was hard to take everything in , '@@ ' he says .
`` I asked my consul@@ tant `` How long do I have ? '@@ '
I was quoted about 12 months .
I remember thinking `` Well , I wo n@@ '@@ t see Christmas again .
that '@@ s it . '@@ ' '@@ '
Mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma is particularly per@@ n@@ icious , because it is the mechan@@ ics of how we stay alive - the very act of breathing - that causes the cancer that kil@@ ls .
most Mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma cases are caused by exposure to as@@ besto@@ s .
as@@ besto@@ s is made up of tiny fi@@ b@@ res .
when the as@@ besto@@ s is disturbed and the fi@@ b@@ res are in@@ hal@@ ed , they can become embedded in the ple@@ ura , the lining of the lun@@ gs .
as@@ besto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res irrit@@ ate the ple@@ ura and can cause cell mu@@ tations .
`` The problem comes from in@@ hal@@ ed need@@ le-@@ shaped fi@@ b@@ res of as@@ besto@@ s , '@@ ' Profess@@ or T@@ om tre@@ asure , a car@@ di@@ o-@@ th@@ or@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ ge@@ on who moved in 2001 to Gu@@ y '@@ s Ho@@ sp@@ ital .
the very hospital where Andrew L@@ aw@@ son suspected he was exposed to as@@ besto@@ s is now , ironically , a leading Cent@@ re in treating mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma .
tre@@ asure knew L@@ aw@@ son , and treated some others who are likely to have been exposed while training at the hospital .
once the as@@ besto@@ s need@@ les get into the l@@ ung tissue , says tre@@ asure , `` the act of breathing pushes them on the periphery , which is where the lining is .
it is by its nature inva@@ sive from the very beginning .
the normal options for treating other forms of cancer work less well with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma .
the effectiveness of surgery , for example , is hot@@ ly debated .
some feel it is worth trying .
tre@@ asure dis@@ agrees .
`` You ca n@@ '@@ t exci@@ se the ple@@ ura , '@@ ' he says .
you ca n@@ '@@ t get your kni@@ fe round it .
meanwhile the cancer `` is not very responsive to chemotherapy , '@@ ' which `` has an effect '@@ ' but does not cure .
`` E@@ very now and again you get long survivors , '@@ ' says tre@@ asure .
but in the end they all die .
happily , some patients do live far , far beyond expectations .
the author Stephen J@@ ay G@@ ould died 20 years after diagnosis .
two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t is still batt@@ ling on .
after cont@@ acting mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma Ab@@ bot@@ t was put in touch with Andrew L@@ aw@@ son , who , four years after his diagnosis , had become a one-@@ man support and advice bure@@ au for fellow suff@@ er@@ ers .
`` hel@@ lo , cancer Central , '@@ ' he would announce cheer@@ ily when they called .
`` He was very positive , '@@ ' says Ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had been diagnosed 4 years before and was still very active .
initially , Ab@@ bot@@ t had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months , and likely prolong his life by just one month .
`` I felt desperate , '@@ ' he says .
I felt like giving up .
L@@ aw@@ son , however , `` managed to put a slightly better tin@@ t on things . '@@ '
after seeing several consul@@ tants , Ab@@ bot@@ t decided to pursue his treatment with Pro@@ f Lo@@ ic L@@ ang@@ -L@@ a@@ zd@@ un@@ ski , professor in th@@ or@@ ac@@ ic surgery at Gu@@ y '@@ s .
`` We had an advantage in that I did n@@ '@@ t have to be referred , I just ran@@ g them up and they saw me , '@@ ' Graham admits .
the average patient would have to get a refer@@ ral and have funding approved .
money is crucial for those with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma to pursue the best available treatments .
but when those treatments eventually , inevitably , fail , many suff@@ er@@ ers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind .
and so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation .
Andrew L@@ aw@@ son cont@@ acted Andrew Morgan , from Fi@@ eld Fi@@ sher Water@@ house LL@@ P .
`` It has been known that as@@ besto@@ s is no@@ xi@@ ous to health since 18@@ 98 , '@@ ' says Morgan .
but what changed in the 1960s is that it was real@@ ised that even very low levels could be a risk to health .
that is where company neg@@ ligence came in .
Andrew L@@ aw@@ son and Gu@@ y '@@ s hospital eventually settled their case , but it was not what Morgan calls a `` full-@@ value settlement '@@ ' since L@@ aw@@ son could not prove defini@@ tively that his mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma was down to as@@ besto@@ s exposure at Gu@@ y '@@ s .
after the in@@ quest into his death , a spokes@@ man for Gu@@ y '@@ s did confirm , however , that `` the as@@ besto@@ s in the bas@@ ement area concerned was removed in the 1990s . '@@ '
that was too late for Andrew L@@ aw@@ son .
how to remove as@@ besto@@ s
in fact , p@@ inning lethal as@@ besto@@ s exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved a huge problem for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers seeking compensation .
many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business .
insurance records may have been lost .
and those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side , which the claim@@ ants certainly do not .
in response , this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be traced .
the law has created a £ 3@@ 5@@ 0@@ m pot of money , funded by the insurance industry , for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue .
in these cases suff@@ er@@ ers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court might have awarded in a normal compensation case - about £ 1@@ 20,000 .
about 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year .
Andrew Morgan , like many involved with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers , thinks that £ 3@@ 5@@ 0@@ m represents `` a very good job '@@ ' for the insurance industry .
`` It '@@ s a deal written by insur@@ ers for insur@@ ers '@@ ' he says , suggesting that the sum is a quarter of what insur@@ ers would have had to pay if the passage of time had not intervened , and mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers were able to track down companies and sue them in the normal way .
even Mi@@ ke Pen@@ ning , then Wor@@ ks and Pen@@ sions minister , admitted that the law was `` not perfect . '@@ '
but both Pen@@ ning and Morgan admit that , with seven victims dying each day , quick action was needed .
`` People are suffering so much , and need help today , '@@ ' said Pen@@ ning during the Mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ oma Bill '@@ s second reading in December last year .
by then , Graham Ab@@ bot@@ t had been in the hands of Pro@@ f Lo@@ ic L@@ ang@@ -L@@ a@@ zd@@ un@@ ski for 19 months .
after their initial consultations , L@@ ang@@ -L@@ a@@ zd@@ un@@ ski advised surgery which , in contrast to T@@ om tre@@ asure , he believes has a positive effect .
this was followed by radi@@ other@@ ap@@ y and chemotherapy - a tri@@ -@@ therapy for which L@@ ang@@ -L@@ a@@ zd@@ un@@ ski can bo@@ ast five year survival rates as high as 40 per cent .
Ab@@ bot@@ t felt empowered .
`` That of course is one of the most important things , '@@ ' says Ab@@ bot@@ t .
you see it in patients all the time .
there is some drive that keeps you going .

once again Ab@@ bot@@ t put himself through six cycles of chemotherapy .
now there is no sign of the tu@@ m@@ ours .

you have to think about practical things - about the finances when I '@@ m gone for example , or showing my wife how the bo@@ il@@ er tim@@ er works .
when you get bad news you start getting negative .
you have to look forward .

China refuses to give Hong Kong right to choose leaders ; protesters vo@@ w vengeance
China '@@ s parliament decided Sunday against letting Hong Kong voters nomin@@ ate candidates for the 20@@ 17 election , despite growing ag@@ itation for democratic reform .
the move is likely to spark long-@@ promised protests in Hong Kong '@@ s business district , as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement .
the decision by China '@@ s National People '@@ s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to weed out any candidates not loyal to Beijing .
`` It '@@ s not unexpected , but it is still inf@@ uri@@ ating , '@@ ' said legisla@@ tor Em@@ ily La@@ u , cha@@ ir@@ woman of the Democratic Party .
this is not what Beijing promised .
they '@@ ve lied to the people of Hong Kong .
and it '@@ s clear we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
defending China '@@ s ruling , Li Fe@@ i , deputy secretary general of the Stan@@ ding Committee of the National People '@@ s Congress , said allowing public nomin@@ ations in the election for Hong Kong '@@ s leader would be too `` chaotic . '@@ '
since 1997 , when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China , Beijing had promised to allow the region '@@ s residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 20@@ 17 .
Chinese leaders presented the Sunday ruling as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong K@@ ong@@ ers a direct vote , but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nomin@@ ating committee tightly controlled by Beijing .
and , according to a new clause , only candidates who `` love the country , and love Hong Kong '@@ ' would be allowed .
the ruling comes after a summer that has fe@@ atured some of the largest and most high-@@ profile protests in Hong Kong in years .
behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the occupy Central With L@@ ove and Peace movement , whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not grant authentic universal suff@@ rage .
on Sunday night , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of occupy Central supporters had assembled in the rain outside the Hong Kong government '@@ s headquarters .
at the demonstration , organizers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil di@@ sob@@ edience and that they would mount waves of protests in the coming weeks .
however , they did not give details , apparently looking to avoid problems with authorities .
in an online statement , organizers said the movement `` has considered occupying Central only as the last resort , an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice .
we are very sorry to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen .
authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing '@@ s announcement for days , and security was tight Sunday at the government headquarters , with police and bar@@ ric@@ ades deployed .
driving the unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city .
an influx of main@@ lan@@ ders is fueling competition for products and services .
there is also growing fear that Hong Kong '@@ s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , are beginning to b@@ end under increasing pressure from Beijing .
some have criticized the occupy Central movement , saying its demonstrations put business - the life@@ blood of Hong Kong - at risk .
`` The protest they are talking about , it could result in much economic damage , depending on how many are involved and for how long , '@@ ' said legisla@@ tor Re@@ g@@ ina I@@ p , who has long criticized the movement .
we do n@@ '@@ t want concern to spread that Hong Kong is getting out of control .
this is a perception that is bad for investment .
China '@@ s state-@@ run media also has run stories in recent days pain@@ ting Hong Kong '@@ s democracy activists as agents of sub@@ version directed by Western powers .
this summer , activists organized an uno@@ ff@@ ici@@ al referendum on voting rights that drew 7@@ 80,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters .
and in July , tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region '@@ s history .

a League in Ji@@ hlava carries its name under a political movement .
Min@@ or-@@ league soccer is played in Vy@@ so@@ činy '@@ s regional capital by approximately 1,@@ 600 amate@@ ur athletes .
and their biggest competition is newly called the To@@ gether for Ji@@ hlava League .
the name is that of a political movement that is taking part in the October municipal elections .
its tenth candidate is the head of the min@@ or-@@ league soccer team in Ji@@ hlava , Jan M@@ rá@@ ka .
`` A plen@@ ary session was held , at which no one had a problem with the idea , '@@ ' M@@ rá@@ ka explained .
the situation surrounding the first min@@ or-@@ league soccer team has already been addressed by lawyers for the Ji@@ hlava City H@@ all , and they have recommended changing the system of dividing grants .
last year , around C@@ Z@@ K 1 million was allocated for min@@ or-@@ league soccer by the city , according to its web@@ site .
this year too , it will receive hundreds of thousands .
according to the expressed legal opinion , the approach by the min@@ or-@@ league soccer team neither conflicts with the law nor with the City H@@ all '@@ s directives .
`` H@@ ow@@ ever , the situation gives the relevant authority a reason to change the rules for allocation of grants and subsidies , '@@ ' explained City H@@ all spokes@@ man Ra@@ dek Tu@@ lis .
drawing grants from the city and at the same time expressing support for a single political party in the elections as the min@@ or-@@ league soccer team is probably not acceptable .
no similar request has yet been addressed to maj@@ or-@@ league soccer in Vy@@ so@@ činy by politicians .
suppose , for example , that a Social Democratic Party regional champion@@ ship , a Ci@@ vic Democratic Party division or a Christian Democratic Uni@@ on-@@ Czechoslov@@ ak People '@@ s Party 1 .
a category or similar competitive events were created .
I would not be in favor of it .
instead , I would be gla@@ d if sponsors from a number of companies cont@@ acted us , '@@ ' said Regi@@ onal S@@ oc@@ cer Association Chairman Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v V@@ r@@ zá@@ ček .
the head of min@@ or-@@ league soccer will not allow other parties or movements into the league '@@ s name .
according to min@@ or-@@ league soccer players , this sport in Ji@@ hlava deserves its own site with six fields , lo@@ cker rooms and re@@ stro@@ oms .
`` For example , the na St@@ oup@@ ách field is not ours , we are r@@ enting it , '@@ ' pointed out O@@ nd@@ ře@@ j L@@ ap@@ e@@ š from St@@ ar@@ let Ji@@ hlava .
Če@@ ský ml@@ ý@@ n would probably be the best location .
however , I believe that in that location a ridic@@ ulous site for sk@@ ate@@ boar@@ ders is going to be built there , and Ji@@ hlava already has about 50 of them , '@@ ' M@@ rá@@ ka said .
Ji@@ hlava Mayor Jaro@@ sla@@ v Vy@@ maz@@ al -LRB- Ci@@ vic Democratic Party -RRB- has reacted by noting that the min@@ or-@@ league soccer team uses a field with artificial turf on Ro@@ š@@ ického a na St@@ oup@@ ách Stre@@ ets , which are owned by the city .
`` We want to build a field that will have maximum use .
we are planning modernization or development of sports stadi@@ ums near schools , which will be accessible during after@@ no@@ on hours .
I think major progress has been made in recent years for min@@ or-@@ league soccer , '@@ ' Vy@@ maz@@ al added .
according to Jan M@@ rá@@ ka , no other political parties will appear in the names of le@@ agues .
`` We have limits .
if anyone from one field enters into a partnership with us , we no longer admit another one , '@@ ' he explained .
`` A political movement in the name of a league is something that I consider at least unfortunate , '@@ ' said Karel Vol@@ dán , a member of the City Council '@@ s commission for sports .
`` But let players decide whether Mr. M@@ rá@@ ka is using Ji@@ hlava '@@ s min@@ or-@@ league soccer association and grants from the city for political purposes or not , '@@ ' he added .
US pro@@ m culture hits university life with fre@@ sh@@ ers offered private jet entran@@ ces
we '@@ re ex@@ cited to be answ@@ ering this demand by launching the UK '@@ s first lux@@ uri@@ ous travel service for the students of today .
to make the maximum impact arri@@ ving at university , the company also offers transport options including private jet , Rol@@ l@@ s@@ -R@@ o@@ y@@ ce ph@@ an@@ tom , A@@ ston Martin or Mc@@ Lar@@ en P@@ 1 .
Mr Ste@@ war@@ t also claimed the service had a safety aspect .
the service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to ha@@ ul their belong@@ ings across the country in a dangerously over@@ loaded car .
pa@@ ired with our new V@@ I@@ F options , we '@@ re looking forward to ensuring this year students reach university with minimum fus@@ s and maximum luxury .
a spokes@@ man for the company said that because the service has just launched there have been no book@@ ings yet but added that `` students will be boo@@ king the service over the next few weeks . '@@ '
the company also said that despite students facing tu@@ ition fees of £ 9@@ ,000 a year , it still expected to find a market for the service .
students of today are quite different in terms of expectations and aspirations , compared to students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it '@@ s more important than ever to make a great first impression and V@@ I@@ F is just the way to do that .
however , the National Union of students critici@@ sed the service as out of touch .
Me@@ g@@ an D@@ un@@ n , N@@ US vice president for higher education , said : `` This scheme seems incredibly out of touch with the lives of the majority of students .
many students starting university this month are facing a cost of living crisis , with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spir@@ al@@ ling bills for basic ess@@ entials , before they can even start thinking about for@@ king out thousands of po@@ unds for something as simple arri@@ ving at their hal@@ ls of residence .
femin@@ ists take on race and police conduct post-@@ Ferguson
the un@@ armed teen@@ ager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson , M@@ o . , earlier this month .
atten@@ de@@ es hold their hands up while chan@@ ting , `` H@@ ands up , do n@@ '@@ t shoot , '@@ ' as they wait in line before the fun@@ eral .
after two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo@@ . over the shooting of un@@ armed teen@@ ager Michael Brown , blogg@@ er Mi@@ ri@@ am Zo@@ ila Per@@ ez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white femin@@ ists .
in her experience , white fem@@ inist commen@@ ters prioriti@@ zed gender above race when it came to pushing forward reproductive rights and income inequality .
but as tensions rose in the Mid@@ west and drew nationwide coverage , Per@@ ez saw responses from white women that centered 100 percent around race .
compared to the responses of black women soon after the shooting on August 9 , the personal es@@ says with tit@@ les like `` thoughts on Ferguson as a white woman '@@ ' and `` femin@@ ism Is N@@ ot Ju@@ st Ab@@ out W@@ omen '@@ s oppression '@@ ' came relatively late .
but to Per@@ ez , it demonstrated a significant shift .
`` In femin@@ ism , I do n@@ '@@ t think you get a lot of people talking about wh@@ it@@ eness and privilege in such a high level way , '@@ ' she said .
people felt called to voice something about what happened .
it '@@ s very emblematic of the crisis we face and because -LSB- the situation in Ferguson -RSB- is so ra@@ ci@@ alized , they have to call that out .
for O@@ hi@@ o State University English professor K@@ ori@@ tha Mitchell , Ferguson brought to light issues that black American women face every day but that are n@@ '@@ t seen as `` women '@@ s issues '@@ ' in the cultural sphere .
`` I can post something fun@@ ny on Facebook about what '@@ s going on with me and my partner and it will get 150 likes from all over the place , '@@ ' said Mitchell .
when I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country , the silence is de@@ af@@ ening .
`` How is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere ? '@@ ' she asked .
for black women like Mitchell who have studied race , gender and sexu@@ ality in U.S. history , there is no dichot@@ omy between issues regarding race and gender .
to her , black women have not had the luxury of ne@@ at@@ ly separating the issues ; they live the combined reality every day .
while white women are now combining issues of race and gender in mainstream fem@@ inist spheres , Angela H@@ at@@ tery , women and gender studies professor at George Mas@@ on University , says their predecessors did the opposite .
`` Bet@@ we@@ en 18@@ 65 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were lyn@@ ched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , '@@ ' said H@@ at@@ tery .
you needed the white woman to be complicit in the narrative to justify the lyn@@ ching .
to H@@ at@@ tery , the breakdown between white and black women came when white suff@@ ra@@ g@@ ists like S@@ us@@ an B@@ . An@@ th@@ ony surve@@ yed the landscape in the late 18@@ 0@@ 0s and saw that the fight for voting rights would only work for one group at a time : women or blacks .
`` They made the decision to put their eggs in the basket for votes for women and votes for Bla@@ cks would come later , '@@ ' said H@@ at@@ tery .
to look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color do n@@ '@@ t trust white women .
we have n@@ '@@ t done a good job .
we have n@@ '@@ t helped black women protect their hus@@ bands and sons ever .
even after women won the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women to organize against lyn@@ ching as the Association of Southern W@@ om@@ an for the Pre@@ ven@@ tion of lyn@@ ching .
the group came nearly 40 years after black women originally asked for assistance , said Mitchell .
to Mitchell , the up@@ s@@ well of white fem@@ inist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police conduct , racial discrimination - reflect the times white femin@@ ists have had to play `` catch up '@@ ' to issues black women have gra@@ ppled with for generations .
`` W@@ ould n@@ '@@ t it be great if the activists who have those -LSB- traditional fem@@ inist -RSB- plat@@ forms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control ? '@@ ' posed Mitchell .
second wave femin@@ ists who made careers out of fighting for reproductive rights and access to birth control are now fig@@ uring out what that means .
noted white fem@@ inist activist G@@ l@@ ori@@ a Ste@@ inem took to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown '@@ s shooting to post a pointed column by Gu@@ ar@@ dian colum@@ ni@@ st Re@@ bec@@ ca Car@@ roll that demanded more protest from white Americans on the issue of racism .
`` I hope women , who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger that is located in the body - and racial opinions that are measu@@ ra@@ bly different in public polls - will lead the change , '@@ ' Ste@@ inem wrote .
although Ste@@ inem has v@@ ou@@ ched for a more inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism that includes issues of race as well as gender , her comments on race in America still puzzle some .
American En@@ ter@@ prise Institute scholar Christ@@ ina Som@@ m@@ ers , author of `` W@@ ho stole femin@@ ism ? , '@@ ' told S@@ he The People that young men in the United States , especially young men of color , are `` far more vulnerable than their sist@@ ers , '@@ ' but Ste@@ inem '@@ s remarks on Ferguson counter the criticism she has launched in the past .
we now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the White House recently initiated a small program , My Bro@@ ther '@@ s keep@@ er , to help vulnerable black and Hisp@@ anic young men , there was an angry reaction from many femin@@ ists , including G@@ l@@ ori@@ a Ste@@ inem .
police relations with the black community is not the only issue pushing to the forefront of mainstream femin@@ ism .
after U.S. border pat@@ ro@@ l ap@@ prehen@@ ded nearly 6@@ 3,000 unac@@ companied min@@ ors at the country '@@ s sou@@ thwest border this year , immigration reform sur@@ faced once again - this time as a women '@@ s issue .
Andre@@ a Mer@@ cad@@ o , co-@@ chair of We belong To@@ gether , an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform , said that in order to re@@ brand the issue as essential for women , all she needed to do was share immigrant women '@@ s stories .
`` They speak for themselves , '@@ ' Mer@@ cad@@ o said .
when the vast majority of employment visas are given to -LSB- male immigrants -RSB- , the women who come with them are left in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
`` The@@ se stories reson@@ ate with women '@@ s organizations , '@@ ' she said .
I@@ ps@@ wi@@ ch ` pi@@ g in residence ' house for sale
a picture for a house for sale in Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k was removed by estate agents when it emerged it showed a large pi@@ g at rest in the living room .
on sale for £ 1@@ 20,000 , the deta@@ ched one-@@ bed@@ room property sits on a private road in I@@ ps@@ wi@@ ch .
the partic@@ ul@@ ars fe@@ atured a picture of the living room of the house - which included a pi@@ g with its head re@@ sting on a set@@ tee .
estate agents Con@@ ne@@ l@@ ls said the pi@@ g in the photo was the home owner '@@ s pet .
`` H@@ ow@@ ever , the photo was put up in error and has since been removed , '@@ ' a spokes@@ woman for the company said .
in the partic@@ ul@@ ars for the property , Con@@ ne@@ l@@ ls described the former meeting house as a `` unique one bed@@ room deta@@ ched house . '@@ '
although the agency has removed the image from its web@@ site , it still appears in publicity material .
the house sale has sparked interest on social media , where some have en@@ qui@@ red whether the pi@@ g is included in the sale .
S@@ W town of Har@@ vey has fresh million@@ aire after Lot@@ to win
a Har@@ vey lot@@ to player is in the month .
the search is on for a new million@@ aire in Per@@ th '@@ s sou@@ th-@@ west , with one lucky person taking home nearly $ 1.1 million from Satur@@ day night '@@ s lot@@ to draw .
a Har@@ vey new@@ s@@ agency struck gold in the division one draw for the second time in five years , the last being $ 1 million in November 2009 .
however the lucky winner has yet to come forward .
owner of the store Ste@@ ve For@@ ward said the win was creating a bu@@ z@@ z around the small town in Per@@ th '@@ s south west .
it '@@ s the talk of the town and everyone is pretty ex@@ cited .
we thought a win like this might be close .
eight wa winners have celebrated division one wins last month , cap@@ ping off a lucky few weeks for the state '@@ s players .
last week a Can@@ ning V@@ ale player became one of five August million@@ aire '@@ s , following a Bel@@ mon@@ t couple '@@ s massive $ 7.@@ 5 million win only a few weeks prior .
the winning couple had played the game for twenty years and said the win gi@@ fted them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new house .
the Har@@ vey million@@ aire brings wa up to 59 division one winners for the year , total@@ ling in nearly $ 85 million .
Deutsche B@@ ah@@ n '@@ s tra@@ ins will not run this evening .
the engineers want higher wages .
in a press statement , G@@ D@@ L described the protest as a warning strike , for which it inten@@ tionally chose a time outside of the peak period .
by selecting its time for the strike , G@@ D@@ L took into consideration the many people who did not return from their weekend away until during the next work day .
`` We also are thinking of people who leave for work during the day , '@@ ' the union said in a press statement on M@@ ond@@ ay morning regarding the announcement of the strike .
`` Our first strike is expected mainly to affect fre@@ ight transport and will affect passen@@ gers less , '@@ ' G@@ D@@ L added .
D@@ B has not yet released an official public reaction to the announced strike .
it is not clear either how the protest will affect international rail connections , including those with the Czech Republic .
the unions are demanding 5 % wage increases for engineers and shor@@ tening of their work period by two hours per week .
engineers ' average wages currently range between 3@@ 6,000 and 4@@ 6,000 euros -LRB- C@@ Z@@ K 9@@ 9@@ 8,@@ 0@@ 000 to 1.@@ 27 million -RRB- annually , depending on the number of years worked .
D@@ B engineers work 39 hours per week .
D@@ B is refusing to allow wages to increase while still shor@@ tening the work period .
the company points out that wage increases for engineers must develop in the same way as for other rail@@ way staff , whose work week D@@ B does not intend to reduce .
there was a risk that K@@ rest '@@ s car would catch fire .
therefore , he finished at the Bar@@ um rally .
what exactly happened ?
it was a material defec@@ t .
the car was brand new , so it did n@@ '@@ t occur to me that something like that could happen .
could n@@ '@@ t the exhau@@ st pi@@ pe be repa@@ ired temporarily to enable the car to be driven at a slower pace to a service center , where mechan@@ ics would replace it ?
if we had headed right there , then yes .
but another two special stages awa@@ ited us , so it was impossible .
there '@@ s a high temperature in it and there was a great risk that the car could catch on fire .
I can not allow that to happen .
at full pace , you managed five speed tests .
what was your impression from them ?
it was very good .
I felt like when I was younger .
we were fast , but I did n@@ '@@ t go through with it .
everything was caused by the fact that we worked on the car for more than half a year to get it to a certain level .
the race showed that we managed it .
did you get so into it that you could n@@ '@@ t really imagine victory ?
I prepared myself and the car so that we would really be in reach of victory .
our work did n@@ '@@ t result in nothing .
on the other hand , we did n@@ '@@ t get the outcome that we had expected .
but that '@@ s the Bar@@ um rally .
technology unfortunately said no .
you were not the only one from the top who got out of the race for first place early .
foreign favori@@ tes such as Bre@@ en , Ab@@ bring and L@@ ap@@ pi did too .
were you surprised that so many favori@@ tes withdrew ?
yes .
mainly for spec@@ tat@@ ors , it was a pity , because it caused the race to end early .
Jaro@@ mír Tar@@ abu@@ s , for you are preparing a car , was also at the top for a long time .
but he paid the price of ve@@ ering from the route and suffered a loss of nearly two minutes .
how satisfied were you with his performance ?
it '@@ s a pity , because he could have repeated the winners ' levels .
after all , he drove the first two times .
even M@@ ira confirmed to me that we had prepared the car well .
he went very fast .
exactly a year ago , you announced the end of your career , but you still showed up at the start of the Bar@@ um rally .
could your good feeling from this event make you a regular particip@@ ant in rally ra@@ ces ?
certainly not at this time .
last year , I said that the Bar@@ um would be my last race , and I still did n@@ '@@ t keep the promise .
I decided to race again .
it was my nineteenth start here , and if there '@@ s a chance in a year from now , then I will take it .
but I '@@ m not considering anything after that .
a lot of people came to the track just because of you .
did it make you happy ? ?
to a certain extent , we started because of them .
a lot of people , people who I know and do n@@ '@@ t know , constantly asked if I would race .
I wanted to make them happy .
what awa@@ its you after the Bar@@ um ?
the team will press on .
next week we are going to V@@ yš@@ kova , where Robert Adol@@ f will race .
I hope he has n@@ '@@ t damaged the car very much here .
furthermore , for this race sometimes he wants to borrow the F@@ ab@@ ia from Hon@@ za Sý@@ kor@@ a .
with M@@ ira , we will participate in European double ra@@ ces in Switzerland and Cor@@ s@@ ica .
for that , we will have to prepare some things for next year .
can you already indicate anything ?
no , nothing has been decided .
when the Cor@@ s@@ ica rally belonged to the World Ch@@ ampi@@ on@@ ship , you achieved fifth place , you maximum in the series .
are n@@ '@@ t you in the mood to try that track again ?
no , I '@@ m not .
a verbal agreement with an employer can be a problem .
unfortunately , you have not yet had your physici@@ an issue a confirmation of your work disability , which serves as evidence for an organization that for health reasons you can not carry out your work duties .
moreover , you did not immediately no@@ tify your employer of the absence .
subsequently , although you reached an agreement that the particular days would be recorded as vacation , the agreement was made only verb@@ ally .
although the Labor Office does not require an employee to have the employer '@@ s permission to take leave confirmed in writing , in practice this approach has proven effective .
if there is only a verbal agreement , then you wo n@@ '@@ t have a confirmation of it .
later , the supposed consent with drawing leave , like in your case , can be denied , and your absence from work can be evalu@@ ated as a long-term in@@ exc@@ us@@ able absence and a reason for immediate termin@@ ation of employment under section 53 of the Labor C@@ ode .
then if there is a court dispute about the agreement with the employer , you will lack prov@@ able evidence .
however , employment with you has not been canceled pursu@@ ant to section 53 , you only have the particular days specified in your records as an in@@ exc@@ us@@ able absence .
an in@@ exc@@ us@@ able absence in your records will not have the same consequences as section 53 -LRB- such as the inability to collect unemployment benefits -RRB- , even though it hin@@ ders your ability to seek new employment .

Tony Ste@@ war@@ t cra@@ shes in return to track
Tony Ste@@ war@@ t '@@ s return to the track has ended only a little over hal@@ f@@ way through his race at A@@ tl@@ anta Mot@@ or Spe@@ ed@@ way .
Ste@@ war@@ t hit the wall for the second time after his right front ti@@ re ble@@ w out on lap 17@@ 2 , ending his night .
Ste@@ war@@ t drove his battered car to the gar@@ age and then ex@@ ited without speaking to reporters .
his cre@@ w chief Chad John@@ ston said the 14 team was disappointed , but will now start focusing on next weekend '@@ s race in Rich@@ mon@@ d , Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia .
`` I wish we could have had a better effort and a better finish for him , '@@ ' John@@ ston said .
we '@@ ll go on to Rich@@ mon@@ d and hope we can do better there .
Ste@@ war@@ t first went into the wall earlier in Sunday night '@@ s race following a colli@@ sion with Ky@@ le Bus@@ ch , requiring work to the right side of his car .
`` I went into today with some pretty good hopes of fin@@ ishing well , '@@ ' John@@ ston said , adding , `` It just did n@@ '@@ t work out . '@@ '
not long after the second crash , Ste@@ war@@ t '@@ s car was loaded onto the ha@@ ul@@ er and the team was pac@@ ked up and ready to leave .
Ste@@ war@@ t ski@@ pped three NA@@ SCA@@ R s@@ print Cup ra@@ ces after his car struck and killed a fellow driver in a dir@@ t-@@ track race in up@@ state New York .
he decided to return this week , ne@@ eding to win either at A@@ tl@@ anta or the next race at Rich@@ mon@@ d to claim a spot in the Cha@@ se .
he returned to work as an investigation into the tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-@@ year-old K@@ ev@@ in ward J@@ r . , who had stepped on the track to confront Ste@@ war@@ t during a race .
authorities said Fri@@ day that the pro@@ be into the cause of the crash will last at least another two weeks .
no decision has been made about whether Ste@@ war@@ t will face charges .
the three-@@ time champion received a big che@@ er when he was introduced before the race .
starting in the 12th spot , Ste@@ war@@ t ran in the top 10 early in the race , getting as high as fourth .
then , on lap 1@@ 22 after a restart , Bus@@ ch '@@ s No .
18 machine got loose coming out of turn 2 and ban@@ ged into Ste@@ war@@ t , sending both cars against the wall .
Ste@@ war@@ t carried on but dropped back to 21st .
Prague chooses new tax@@ i stand firm , it will earn 1@@ 2.3 million
the City of Prague has completed a ten@@ der for a new manager of its tax@@ i stands .
for 10@@ 3 tax@@ i par@@ king locations , it will earn approximately C@@ Z@@ K 1@@ 2.3 million per year .
until recently , it had been collecting C@@ Z@@ K 150,000 for the same tax@@ i stands .
the information was provided by City Council member Lu@@ ká@@ š Man@@ har@@ t -LRB- top 0@@ 9 -RRB- .
the city previously used draw@@ ings to select management companies .
the winner then got to manage the locations for a flat fee of C@@ Z@@ K 1,000 per year .
however , the rules have changed .
the amount of the offer is currently decisive .
`` A year since the termin@@ ation of the original contract and the start of the ten@@ der , it became apparent that the new system of le@@ asing would be much more beneficial for Prague and entirely fair , '@@ ' the council member said .
the most expensive spot is on na Per@@ št@@ ý@@ ně Street .
the highest price has been offered by those interested in tax@@ i stands on na Per@@ št@@ ý@@ ně Street .
they will pay C@@ Z@@ K 2.@@ 1 million per year .
the new administra@@ tors paid approximately C@@ Z@@ K 1.5 million for locations such as in front of the Mun@@ ici@@ pal House and on W@@ en@@ ces@@ las Square .
the new rules for le@@ asing tax@@ i stands were adopted by council members in the autumn of 2012 , and last summer they termin@@ ated the original le@@ ase agreements .
the ten@@ der was held in four rounds , and the new administra@@ tor will get 29 tax@@ i stands .
we had to clean the well for the second time this year already .
each time , we completely emp@@ tied it , which practically created a second pon@@ d around the cot@@ t@@ age .
then we poured Sav@@ o into it .
what an incredible sten@@ ch !
our well in the bas@@ ement always had plenty of fra@@ grant water .
and it was not done profession@@ ally in who knows what way , but grand@@ pa du@@ g it one his own .
a long time ago .
it was just three r@@ ings and generally peculiar , just like everything else at the cot@@ t@@ age , but as I say .
the water was great .
until this year .
when we began the season , of course we pumped the water out .
it deserved to be pumped out , since it had been sitting for several months .
but even afterwards it seemed that the water somehow did n@@ '@@ t sm@@ ell good .
it occurred to us that something might have fallen in .
at the place where the pump went through , with a bit of bad luck it was possible , as a sla@@ b there was not entirely sec@@ lu@@ ded , and the opening was se@@ aled with a piece of br@@ ick .
our inspection confirmed that the br@@ ick had moved .
otherwise , nothing was visible in the water , and we sh@@ ined all the way to the bottom .
so we emp@@ tied and clean@@ ed it again .
of course , we improved the improv@@ ised se@@ aling around the pump pi@@ pe .
however , in the bas@@ ement we noticed some strange things .
on the ground there was a package with some small cu@@ bes .
or at least that '@@ s how they looked .
and there were more a little further away .
now it looked like a sli@@ my mou@@ se .
by the ceiling , in locations where there were through v@@ ents , grand@@ pa '@@ s discovery was found : pieces of fish !
and heavily e@@ aten !
our cell@@ ar is also strange .
someone could say that grand@@ pa in short du@@ g under the cot@@ t@@ age .
and that would not be far from the truth .
the walls and the floor are only comp@@ acted sand , and only the ceiling is wood@@ en .
mainly boats are placed there .
and bicy@@ cles .
and be@@ ach chairs .
the gate with wide gaps has usually been open , and someone always has been able to get through it .
by the ceiling there are already several of the mentioned v@@ ents .
without a net , so birds regularly fly in and build their ne@@ sts there .
it '@@ s needless to mention mice .
Gran@@ d@@ pa wanted to venti@@ late , but it was n@@ '@@ t going to happen .
now of course , even air did not help .
the entire bas@@ ement stan@@ k .
so we clean@@ ed the entire bas@@ ement .
that fish on the be@@ am was especially nut@@ riti@@ ous !
we also threw away items that were nearby : boards , a her@@ ac@@ li@@ th@@ ic sla@@ b and more .
our cot@@ t@@ age welcomed pas@@ ser@@ s@@ by from af@@ ar with a dis@@ infec@@ tant od@@ or .
we thought about who could have brought those awful things in .
the ne@@ arest cat lives two kilometers way in a village .
it would have had a hard time coming to our cot@@ t@@ age for a sna@@ ck .
Gran@@ d@@ pa thought it might have been one neighbor , who is not entirely in good condition .
he wondered whether it was Fran@@ ta and if he had pushed the disgu@@ sting things through a vent .
it '@@ s been here practically all year , what stupid ideas he has .
we decided to monitor and regularly check the bas@@ ement and the well .
after a few days , everything was fine .
we began using the water again , so far only for washing and cleaning , until the tests were ready to let us know that it was fine again .
ha@@ uling water from a well in the forest is not something I would like to do for long .
once we heard the frightening bar@@ k of our female dog .
mo@@ m pe@@ ered from the bal@@ con@@ y and saw a long th@@ ick black ho@@ se in the gra@@ ss next to the ver@@ anda .
R@@ é@@ za jumped over it and how@@ led like crazy .
mo@@ m sc@@ ol@@ ded her , because she thought that R@@ é@@ za had du@@ g up the waste ho@@ se from the sink .
but suddenly the ho@@ se was partially rolled up into a ball and partially straigh@@ tened .
then a h@@ iss came from the bal@@ con@@ y .
R@@ é@@ za became hyster@@ ical .
we ran down .
a gra@@ ss s@@ nak@@ e , which was more than a meter long and as th@@ ick as a whi@@ p was planning to swallow a large to@@ ad , and R@@ é@@ za stopped it from doing so .
it was not clear whether she wanted to save the to@@ ad or if she herself wanted to eat it , but that '@@ s not what was important .
when the gra@@ ss s@@ nak@@ e saw that it was out@@ number@@ ed by our entire family , it must have figured we wanted to eat it , since we were so hungry , and it then eleg@@ antly cre@@ pt into the vent leading to the bas@@ ement .
we ran after it .
it jumped out of the well like ligh@@ t@@ ning .
then we noticed that there was another stin@@ king package on the board .
from the sm@@ ell , it must have been a fish .
it was not there the day before yesterday !
our new rein@@ for@@ cement around the pump was a little cro@@ oked .
and we locked the bas@@ ement even during the day .
is it possible that ...
we rushed outside , and each of us approached one vent .
we did n@@ '@@ t wait long .
something was stir@@ ring in the well .
first a small flat head with yellow mar@@ ig@@ olds on its ne@@ ck appeared .
then the entire gra@@ ss s@@ nak@@ e le@@ ap@@ ed from the well .
it moved around the pump and started going inside .
fired worker gets revenge by buying company lap@@ t@@ ops and selling them
a dis@@ g@@ run@@ t@@ led employee bought computers for the company where he worked and then sold them after being fired .
he managed to spend the money he made before the police arrested him .
over a short period in twelve instances the man bought a total of 16 computers for more than C@@ Z@@ K 200,000 .
`` After receiving the lap@@ t@@ ops , he took them to O@@ lom@@ ou@@ c , where he sold them to pa@@ wn shops , '@@ ' š@@ ump@@ er@@ ské Poli@@ ce Commissioner R@@ ost@@ islav Br@@ ü@@ ck@@ ner said .
the employee was motivated by a desire to get revenge for being fired and to make money .
`` D@@ uring questioning he told us that he had used the money for loan re@@ payments , '@@ ' Br@@ ü@@ ck@@ ner said .
the police also discovered that the con@@ -@@ artist was a path@@ ological gamb@@ ler who had repeatedly received psychiatric treatment .
therefore , the money could have ended up in game machines or video lot@@ tery termin@@ als .
`` It '@@ s a fact that we did not find any money on him , '@@ ' the commissioner said .
the con@@ -@@ artist had already once been convicted of theft , and now he faces a prison sentence of one to five years .
the police have not yet said whether the pa@@ wn shops that bought the lap@@ t@@ ops at below their value and then sold them will also face charges .
`` It '@@ s true that they accepted completely new goods , which is at least suspicious , '@@ ' the commissioner said .
none of the pa@@ wn shop owners have yet been charged .
come a little closer you can manage it , or how I enjoyed We R@@ un Prague
this year the organizers have prepared a few changes .
the biggest is the change of route , which has moved the finish to the river bank , instead of going back to the Y@@ el@@ low sp@@ a .
I have looked forward to the race together with the rest of the R@@ un@@ go@@ .@@ c@@ z team , but I tried to enjoy it a little from the other side .
everyone of us on the team decided to say hel@@ lo to your readers in person at a stand , where we took photos and fil@@ med vide@@ os .
in order to perfect view from the other side , I accepted the role of personal guide .
together with my friend Ká@@ ť@@ ou , we hum@@ bly lined up at the end of the corrid@@ or for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start .
we said hel@@ lo to our friends , who were walking around us to the sector for faster run@@ ners .
there was not much time left .
a couple of ju@@ mps to warm up , swit@@ ching on sport test@@ ers , coun@@ t@@ down and start !
cries of ju@@ bil@@ ation , but instead of the quick start it was followed by rushing to the starting line .
after five minutes , we reach the gate , switch on our meters and run with a pace for the tenth hour .
we become inter@@ w@@ ov@@ en with the yellow stretch of run@@ ners , who like Ká@@ ť@@ ou are running their first race .
so far everyone looks re@@ fre@@ shed , and the gradually setting sun on the horizon provides a view of Vy@@ še@@ hrad that nearly takes everyone '@@ s breath away .
the pul@@ sing mass running along the river bank makes it look like all of Prague is running .
on the bank between Vy@@ še@@ hrad and the National The@@ ater , as usual , it becomes apparent who has how much strength .
the slight hill on Pal@@ ac@@ kého Square forces many run@@ ners to slow down or switch to walking .
just before entering Di@@ va@@ del@@ ní Street , I see the police accomp@@ anim@@ ent , and behind them Ví@@ tek Pav@@ li@@ št@@ a , s@@ printing towards finish at an incredible pace .
I hear the other run@@ ners catching their breath .
I move to the edge of the route and che@@ er him on , and he begins to high-@@ five me , but just before that my leg b@@ ends , and our hands slightly miss each other .
the run down Di@@ va@@ del@@ ní Street presents a chance for a brief rest and catching of breath .
it is necessary , because there are places ahead of us where the views are breath@@ taking .
turning onto the Má@@ nes@@ ově B@@ rid@@ ge presents a view of Prague in its full beauty with the setting sun .
I '@@ m not breathing , and my leg@@ s are almost carrying me themselves .
after the first re@@ fre@@ shment , the moment of truth comes .
while running along the road@@ way , Ká@@ ť@@ ou trips on the curb and falls forward .
I look to see whether or not she needs help , and I say a series of encouraging words , so that she wo n@@ '@@ t have time to think about the pain .
she gets up , and we continue along Ko@@ zí L@@ ane , which is one of the narro@@ west parts of the route , and in this stage in the race there is no longer such a rush , but it is still necessary to pay close attention to surro@@ und@@ ings .
I still do n@@ '@@ t realize that the term `` narro@@ west place '@@ ' will take on its true meaning later .
after the pow@@ der To@@ wer , we are fran@@ tically che@@ ered on by tourists and other run@@ ners ' friends .
I try to high-@@ five with everyone who puts out his hand , and I ad@@ vise Ká@@ ť@@ ou to do the same , because ten high-@@ fi@@ ves with fans is like half an energy bar .
it really works , and we speed up again , and although we have fallen quite far behind , the race to catch up has just begun .
we over@@ take dozens of run@@ ners , and when I notice someone especially tired , I try to encourage him with a few words : `` C@@ ome on , just a little farther , you can do it ! '@@ '
after the last re@@ fre@@ shment break , no one runs ahead of us any more , and we speed up .
so far we have run for an hour and fifteen minutes , and we are adding minutes , so there is nothing to wait for .
the three kilometers to the finish are going to hurt , but it is really necessary to make it .
the sun has almost set already , and the ending day symbolic@@ ally slowly ends the race .
the last run to the bridge , a turn and then just a straight route to the finish .
the pace at which we are running amaz@@ es me , and I wonder where comes from .
`` C@@ ome on , we '@@ re going under hour thir@@ teen , let '@@ s do it ! '@@ ' I call out .
we try it , we s@@ print forward , and there is the finish line .
hour thir@@ teen and six secon@@ ds .
well , what can you do ?
the tra@@ in@@ er has set a limit of hour twenty .
so seven minutes under the plan .
that '@@ s a sup@@ er outcome .
just past the finish line , Ká@@ ť@@ ou '@@ s leg@@ s give way , and I help her to the ra@@ iling , where she can rest for a while .
she is visibly exhausted , but also visibly happy about her good performance .
after a while , I gradually take her out from the space of the finish line .
the euphoria prevents us from notic@@ ing the mad da@@ sh to the loc@@ kers .
here , it is obvious that Ko@@ zí L@@ ane was not the narro@@ west place .
that place is here , beyond the finish at the river bank , which is being sw@@ armed by almost 10,000 run@@ ners squeezed together .
if anyone does n@@ '@@ t like crowds , then this is not the place for them .
after a while , I too lose my mind and wonder if those beautiful views and the more interesting route than in previous years were worth experiencing what '@@ s happening now .
from my own experience , I know that hosting an event is nothing to lau@@ gh at .
when combined with 10,000 people , a rich accompanying program and closure of the entire center of Prague to all traffic , it '@@ s a huge challenge .
this year '@@ s change of route showed the run@@ ners many interesting places , which also brought a few really unpleasant surprises .
the excellent atmosphere pumped out of the Y@@ el@@ low sp@@ a found a place among run@@ ners and in the race itself .
the organizers around the route and random spec@@ tat@@ ors intensified it at each meter of the route .
during the run through the historic city center , unfortunately there are obstacles that can not be eliminated , but I do n@@ '@@ t consider putting the finish to the huge race in a location where one side is b@@ ordered by a wall and the other by a river to be the best solution .
if I were to say that the race ended when the run@@ ners ran to the finish , then I would evaluate it as very successful .
beyond the route , I was a little afraid for the health of the participants , but in the end everything turned out well .
please write to us in the discussion forum whether you liked the route and what your thoughts are about the situation with the finish point .
Bulgaria '@@ s P@@ ris@@ on Off@@ ic@@ ers stage National protest
hundreds of prison workers from across Bulgaria have held a national protest in front the Justice Ministry in the capital So@@ fia .
in a peaceful demonstration , they have reiter@@ ated their calls for the old working conditions , which were recently changed , to be restored .
higher salaries are also among a list of requests due to be discussed with interim Justice Minister H@@ rist@@ o Ivanov .
for a month , officers have protested symbolic@@ ally against the new working hours , demanding to return to the old 24 hour shifts .
despite the meetings between the prison officers union and the Justice Ministry representatives , an agreement was not reached , Bulgarian National R@@ adi@@ o -LRB- B@@ N@@ R -RRB- inform@@ s .
negotiations are ongoing , the head of the Chief Direc@@ torate on the execution of Pen@@ alties Ros@@ en Z@@ hel@@ y@@ az@@ kov told B@@ N@@ R .
the protest of the prison workers union is expected to be joined by members of the Trade Union Federation of the Emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es in the Ministry of Interior .
why can the universe have multiple dimensions and we ca n@@ '@@ t see them ?
phys@@ icists do n@@ '@@ t often write best sellers , but Bri@@ an Green from Columbia University managed to hit the bul@@ l '@@ s eye in 1999 .
his book , `` The eleg@@ ant Uni@@ verse , '@@ ' has become for members of the general public the easiest way to del@@ ve into issues being addressed today by several theoretical phys@@ icists , an effort to unite two excell@@ ently functioning , but mutually incompatible , discoveries of the 20th century , quantum theory and the theory of general relativity .
one of the causes of the success of `` The eleg@@ ant Uni@@ verse '@@ ' is undoubtedly that when searching for united physical theories , it '@@ s not a boring story .
phys@@ icists have addressed the basic problem between two key theories -LRB- after all , at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws -RRB- and are resolving it so well that it '@@ s worth it even to explain it to ordinary people .
Green@@ e even cop@@ ed so well with the difficult material , that he ca n@@ '@@ t be criticized for how much interesting information he did n@@ '@@ t include in his book .
furthermore , he has mostly made up for his `` mistake '@@ ' in another two books : `` The S@@ tru@@ cture of the Uni@@ verse '@@ ' and `` The H@@ idden reality . '@@ '
the author obviously would not even object if his book became obsolete more quickly , but it '@@ s a fact that even after 15 years `` The eleg@@ ant Uni@@ verse '@@ ' continues to provide almost everything important that an informed lay@@ man with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics .
it is relatively likely that in the years to come the situation in this area will be somewhat more lively -LRB- for example , since the L@@ H@@ C acceler@@ ator will finally run on `` full gas '@@ ' -RRB- , and so this is a good opportunity to enter the world of modern physics through doors opened up by Green@@ e without force .
how many dimensions could our universe have ?
the idea that our universe may have more than three sp@@ a@@ tial dimensions certainly could seem far-fetched , strange or my@@ st@@ ical .
nonetheless , it is specific and entirely acceptable .
in order for us to understand it , let '@@ s shift our vision for a moment from the universe as a whole to something more down to earth , specifically a long and thin basic gar@@ den ho@@ se .
imagine stret@@ ching a 10@@ 0-@@ meter gar@@ den ho@@ se from one side of a C@@ any@@ on to another and monitoring the entire sc@@ ener@@ y from a distance of half a kilome@@ ter away -LRB- like in the image on the following page -RRB- .
from such a distance , you can easily recognize a long ho@@ se stretched in a horizon@@ tal direction , but if you happen to suffer from per@@ sp@@ ic@@ acity , then you will have difficulty fig@@ uring out the th@@ ick@@ ness of the ho@@ se .
because of your long distance from the ho@@ se , you would think that an ant forced to live on the ho@@ se has only one dimension in which it can walk : a left-@@ right dimension along the ho@@ se .
when someone asks you where the ant is at a particular moment , you can respond to him with only one detail : the ant '@@ s distance from the left -LRB- or right -RRB- end of the ho@@ se .
all that we want to say here is that from a half-@@ kilome@@ ter distance a long piece of ho@@ se looks like a one-@@ dimensional object .
in the real world , the ho@@ se has th@@ ick@@ ness .
if we en@@ large everything , we will suddenly see a second dimension , in the shape of a ring w@@ rap@@ ping around the ho@@ se .
in such an enlarged view , it is obvious that the ant in reality could move in two independent dimensions : in the already well known left-@@ right dimensions along the length of the ho@@ se , but also in `` a clo@@ ck@@ wise or counter@@ clo@@ ck@@ wise direction , '@@ ' meaning around the circ@@ ular cross-@@ section of the ho@@ se .
you will start to understand that in order to determine the position of the small ant , you have to enter two numbers : how far it is from the end of the ho@@ se and where it is on the ring w@@ rap@@ ping around the ho@@ se .
this reflects the fact that the surface of the ho@@ se is two-@@ dimensional . -LRB- N@@ ote : experts point out that this chapter focuses purely on the rupture theory of str@@ ings .
the non-@@ rup@@ turing aspects are addressed in chapters 12 and 13 . -RRB-
the surface of the ho@@ se is two-@@ dimensional : one long parallel dimension is illustrated by a direct ar@@ row , a dimension in the direction of the per@@ im@@ e@@ ter , indicated by a circ@@ ular ar@@ row , is short and co@@ iled .
nonetheless , there is a clear difference between these two dimensions .
the dimension along the ho@@ se is long and easily visible .
the dimension w@@ rap@@ ping the per@@ im@@ e@@ ter of the ho@@ se is short , co@@ iled and harder to recognize .
in order for us to realize the existence of the circ@@ ular dimension , we had to examine a ho@@ se with much better characteristics .
the mentioned example illustrates the important property of sp@@ a@@ tial dimensions .
that it is divided into two groups .
they can be either large , extensive and therefore not directly obvious , or they can be small , co@@ iled and much harder to observe .
of course , in the specified case we did not exactly re-@@ rub in order to un@@ cover the co@@ iled dimension w@@ rap@@ ping the th@@ ick@@ ness of the ho@@ se .
it was enough to pick up a tele@@ scope for help .
but if the ho@@ se were thin@@ ner , like a piece of hair or a cap@@ illary , we could un@@ cover the co@@ iled dimension only with great effort .
in 1919 , K@@ alu@@ za sent Einstein his article , in which he to@@ iled with a huge thought , that the sp@@ a@@ tial geome@@ try of the universe could have more than three of the dimensions that we know .
K@@ alu@@ za explained his radical claim by pointing out that an additional dimension provides an eleg@@ ant and convincing framework , in which Einstein '@@ s general relativity and Ma@@ x@@ well '@@ s elec@@ tro@@ magne@@ tic theory could be combined into one unified concept .
this immediately gives rise the question of how this discovery by K@@ alu@@ za goes together with the obvious fact that we see three dimensions of space .
the answer that K@@ alu@@ za predicted quietly between the lines , and which was clearly expressed and clari@@ fied by Swedish mathema@@ tici@@ an Oskar K@@ le@@ in in 19@@ 26 , rests and falls with the claim that the sp@@ a@@ tial geome@@ try of our universe could have both large and co@@ iled dimensions .
that means that just like the dimension in the direction of the length of the ho@@ se , our universe too has a large , extensive and easily visible set of three dimensions , the existence of which we realize at every moment .
but analog@@ ically to the circum@@ ference of a gar@@ den ho@@ se , the universe too can have additional dimensions , firmly co@@ iled into space with it not obvious that until now they have remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental appar@@ at@@ uses .
in order to get a clearer idea of the basis of K@@ alu@@ za '@@ s note@@ worthy proposal , let '@@ s continue focusing on that ho@@ se for a while .
imagine that on the circum@@ ference of the ho@@ se we draw a relatively th@@ ick row of r@@ ings in black color .
from a distance , the ho@@ se still appears as a thin one-@@ dimensional line .
now with a tele@@ scope , thanks to drawing , we can un@@ cover a co@@ iled dimension even more easily , as shown in figure 2 .
we can clearly see that the surface of the ho@@ se is two-@@ dimensional , with one dimension that is large and almost unlimited , and with another short one and a ring .
K@@ alu@@ za and K@@ le@@ in came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure , but besides one small circ@@ ular dimension it has three large sp@@ a@@ tial dimensions , meaning together four sp@@ a@@ tial dimensions .
it is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions .
in order to help our imagination a little , we should notice the illustra@@ tion in figure 3 ; it shows two large dimensions and one small circ@@ ular dimension .
in the image we can en@@ large the view of the geome@@ try of the space in a way similar to how we enlarged the surface of the ho@@ se .
each of the following levels represents a major enlargement of the geome@@ try of the space from the previous level .
our universe can have additional dimensions -LRB- we see them in the fourth level of enlargement -RRB- , if they are co@@ iled into a sufficiently small space ; this is how we explain that we have not observed them directly so far .
the grid illustrates the well known `` large '@@ ' dimension , while the ring illustrates the new , small and co@@ iled dimension .
just like lo@@ ops of thre@@ ad in a th@@ ick car@@ pet , these r@@ ings too exist in every place with usual dimensions , but for illustra@@ tion we have sk@@ et@@ ched them only in inter@@ w@@ ov@@ en patterns in a grid .
the background of figure 4 illustrates the well known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in typical measuring units , such as meters , illustrated with the side of a small square in a grid .
on each subsequent image , we will focus on the small area of the previous image ; we will en@@ large it so that it becomes visible .
from the beginning , nothing special happens , as we can see in several of the first levels of enlargement .
but when we move further along our path to discover the micro@@ sc@@ opic properties of the geome@@ try of space - to the fourth level of enlargement in figure 3 - then we will suddenly encounter a new dimension co@@ iled in a ring shape , similar to lo@@ ops of thre@@ ad in a th@@ ick piece w@@ ov@@ en piece of car@@ pet .
K@@ alu@@ za and K@@ le@@ in came up with the idea that an additional circ@@ ular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions similar to that of circum@@ ference of a ho@@ se along each point of its length .
for illustra@@ tive purposes , we have drawn the circ@@ ular dimension only in certain regularly placed points .
figure 4 summar@@ izes K@@ alu@@ za '@@ s and K@@ le@@ in '@@ s idea about the micro@@ sc@@ opic structure of geome@@ try of space .
the simil@@ arity to the ho@@ se is obvious , but we can even notice some important differences .
first , the universe has three large sp@@ a@@ tial dimensions far spra@@ wling from each other -LRB- of which we have drawn only two -RRB- , and only ho@@ se has a large dimension .
an even more important difference is that now we are talking about sp@@ a@@ tial geome@@ try of the universe itself , not about any object within the universe , such as our ho@@ se .
but the basic idea is the same .
if the additional circ@@ ularly co@@ iled dimension is extremely mini@@ ature , it can be recognized , just like the round circum@@ ference of the host , much more difficul@@ tly than observ@@ ing obvious , large and extensive dimensions .
if the size of an additional dimension is sufficiently small , un@@ covering it will in fact be beyond the capabilities of our most modern enlargement tools .
however , the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not a mere round pro@@ tuber@@ ance inside regular dimensions , as the two-@@ dimensional illustra@@ tion er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously indicates .
the circ@@ ular dimension is a new dimension , which exists in every point of three regular extensive dimensions .
it is a dimension that is independent of the remaining three dimensions , just as the top-@@ bottom , left-@@ right and front-@@ back dimensions are mutually independent -LRB- and diag@@ onal -RRB- .
a small enough ant could move in all four dimensions , and in order to determine its position we would need four pieces of information , besides the three usual details also the position in the circ@@ ular dimension ; if we figure in time as well , then there are five details , but in any case it there is one more than we would normally expect .

much to our surprise , we are finding out that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space , K@@ alu@@ za '@@ s and K@@ le@@ in '@@ s considerations show that the existence of additional co@@ iled dimensions can not be ruled out , if they are small enough .
the universe could even have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye .
how small should they be ?
the most modern technical equipment can recognize the structure of a billion@@ th of a billion@@ th of a meter .
we rarely can observe smaller co@@ iled dimensions .
in 19@@ 26 , K@@ le@@ in combined K@@ alu@@ za '@@ s original idea with a few ideas from quantum mechan@@ ics , a subject which was becoming known at the time .
his calculations indicated that an additional circ@@ ular dimension could have the size of approximately one Plan@@ ck length , a size far beyond the recognition capabilities of today '@@ s machines .
since then , the phys@@ icists have referred to the possibility of additional small sp@@ a@@ tial dimensions as the K@@ alu@@ za@@ -@@ K@@ le@@ in The@@ ory .
W@@ oh@@ nout member Hon@@ za H@@ om@@ ola gives advice about how to practice on an electric gu@@ it@@ ar : part 5
the overall basis of the `` 12 '@@ ' is the 12@@ -@@ tactic harmon@@ ic form , which you can repeat random@@ ly .
whoever del@@ ves into mus@@ ical theory will find its principle explained in detail here .
Jan H@@ om@@ ola , or Hon@@ za H@@ om@@ ol@@ ka Tob@@ ol@@ ka -LRB- 1976 -RRB-
this trained pup@@ pe@@ te@@ er and string pup@@ pet master , whose Facebook profile can be viewed here , has been living as a gra@@ phic artist since gradu@@ ating from high school twelve years ago .
he is a gu@@ it@@ arist in the band W@@ oh@@ nout , which it is reportedly impossible to quit .
by becoming a gu@@ it@@ arist , he has followed in his father '@@ s foot@@ steps , just like is brother Mat@@ ě@@ j , the leader of W@@ oh@@ nout .
you can begin with training on one string .
`` They r@@ hy@@ th@@ m@@ ic model is up to you , and you can think up anything and then simply apply it to the harmon@@ ic model of the twelve , '@@ ' advis@@ es Hon@@ za .
when you add another string , you can then change the figure again .
it '@@ s enough just to listen to and what Hon@@ za , what can be thought up with the twel@@ ve-@@ member harmony on two str@@ ings and how nice it is beginning to sound .
if you take the third string , you can already flir@@ t with the mel@@ ody of a certain s@@ ong .
and when you finally add the fourth , be atten@@ tive to changes in tun@@ ing , Hon@@ za explains in the video .
then Hon@@ za returns to the p@@ ent@@ at@@ onic , and you can try to put it together with the twel@@ ve-@@ member group .
so practice it di@@ li@@ gently .
you can read about how best to do so in the interview with Jan H@@ om@@ ola during the first lesson of his electr@@ ic-@@ gu@@ it@@ ar-@@ playing school .
another goal without waiting ?
it '@@ s not anything to celebrate a lot about , admits H@@ ra@@ dec player D@@ vo@@ řá@@ k .
we will accept a point , and we are happy for it .
during the first half , the other home team , had more chances , '@@ ' recal@@ ls the offensive player , who this time scored from a penalty kick .
were n@@ '@@ t you nervous when playing it , since , after all there was a lot of boo@@ ing ?
I did n@@ '@@ t really notice it much , even though at the other goal , there the home@@ town fans site , it was probably worse .
after half an hour you made up for the penalty , but you also got the goal out of the penalty in just under four minutes .
what happened ?
we slep@@ t through the beginning , we were passive , and this led to a corner and then a penalty .
after that , you rose , and during the first half you were still a better team that had more chances .
why did that change after the break ?
it '@@ s difficult to say .
I agree that after achieving the goal , we played well until the break .
in the cab@@ in , we said we wanted to sustain the pace of the game after it , but we did not achieve that .
to be honest , I ca n@@ '@@ t even explain why .
it '@@ s probably also true that the home team players said something to each other about their game during the break , and they probably were not satisfied with it .
you first scored on your rival '@@ s field , while at home you have n@@ '@@ t yet gotten even one goal .
why such a difference ?
I would n@@ '@@ t say that it '@@ s such a difference , but it depends on how we battle .
we began well in Br@@ no , but it went down@@ hill for us from then , and P@@ l@@ zeň is an entirely different category .
for four games you waited for a goal , but were you afraid that it could end up the same after the last game ?
well , I do n@@ '@@ t think so , but we are understandably happy that since the last game we have not had to listen to talk about waiting for a goal .
now we have added another without waiting , but there are still only three in six games , which is not yet much to celebrate about .
Iceland - la@@ va flows from a cra@@ ter kilometers away .
la@@ va bub@@ bling to the surface in the Hol@@ u@@ hra@@ un region , near the V@@ at@@ naj@@ ö@@ kul@@ l glaci@@ er , is flowing through an underground tun@@ nel from a cra@@ ter kilometers away .
it is located beneath a glaci@@ er , like part of the mentioned underground la@@ va tun@@ nel .
this situation is now unsettling scientists the most .
however , so far the situation remains unchanged .
since yesterday morning -LRB- August 31
2014 -RRB- about the same amount of la@@ va has been erup@@ ting from the top of the vol@@ c@@ ano .
however , despite original estimates , its amount is lower than 1,000 M@@ 3 , but `` only '@@ ' 3@@ 00-@@ 400 M@@ 3 .
compared to the previous eruption from August 29
2014 , it is 5@@ 0@@ x greater .
however , scientists are worried that the la@@ va tun@@ nel could open up in places where it is below ice .
if that happened , furthermore with intensity similar to that of the current eruption , it would result in major flooding , both at the J@@ ö@@ kul@@ s@@ á á F@@ j@@ ö@@ l@@ lum River and at other rivers .
in the surro@@ und@@ ings of the eruption , there is a strong sm@@ ell of sul@@ fur , and gases and steam are rising from the top .
this certainly is not an eruption suitable for tourism , as was the case with the eruption at F@@ imm@@ v@@ ör@@ ð@@ uh@@ ál@@ s in 2010 .
`` This one is much larger , and there are also a lot more gases , '@@ ' says vol@@ c@@ ano expert Á@@ r@@ mann H@@ ö@@ sk@@ ul@@ d@@ sson .
however , since yesterday the weather has greatly improved , and in the morning it was almost calm in the area .
the tra@@ ces of the sand@@ storm have been wa@@ shed away by rain .
the scientists can continue in their work .

avi@@ ation ac@@ rob@@ at Pe@@ g@@ gy Wal@@ ent@@ in has performed on a Boeing Ste@@ arm@@ an P@@ T-@@ 17 , and during the flight she climbed out of the co@@ ck@@ pit and made her way to the ra@@ ck on the top wing of the bi@@ plane as well as between the wings .
there she is only at the mercy of the strength of her mus@@ cles .
avi@@ ation Day in Ch@@ eb was held this year for the fifth in a row , and the organizers again managed to prepare several interesting air performan@@ ces .
the premi@@ ere at the event at the oldest Czech airport was not only `` the walk on wings '@@ ' by German avi@@ ation ac@@ rob@@ at Pe@@ g@@ gy Wal@@ ent@@ in , but also fe@@ atured the legendary P@@ -@@ 51 D Mu@@ stan@@ g fighter plane and the Be@@ ech@@ craft 18 aircraft .
it drew attention to itself with its bright co@@ ating .
the ac@@ rob@@ atic practice known as W@@ ing@@ walking origin@@ ates from the United States .
after the First World War , many former war pilots attempted it .
however , because of the large number of fatal inju@@ ries , it was banned .
today it is slowly returning to the agenda of air show .
`` After the start , Pe@@ g@@ gy clim@@ bs out of the co@@ ck@@ pit and onto the top wing .
there she demonstrates different exercises .
near the end of the performance , she moves to the space between the aircraft '@@ s wings , where her show continues , '@@ ' explained Lu@@ dě@@ k Mat@@ ě@@ jí@@ ček from the Ch@@ eb U@@ l@@ tr@@ ali@@ ght Club , the organiz@@ er of Avi@@ ation Day .
Wal@@ ent@@ in '@@ s husband Friedrich is the pilot of the Boeing Ste@@ arm@@ an 75 E .
if Pe@@ g@@ gy '@@ s performance was the main attraction of the program , then the demonstration of the Mu@@ stan@@ g fighter plane was the cher@@ ry on the c@@ ake .
the legendary fighter plane was accompanied by G@@ ri@@ p@@ pen@@ s from the Czech Air Force -LRB- in numbers -RRB- .
this was the first time avi@@ ation fans have been able to see such a joint performance in the Czech Republic .
pilot Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v S@@ á@@ zav@@ ský then performed breath@@ taking ac@@ rob@@ a@@ tics for everyone with a plane from 1945 .
the plane was manufactured during the war , it was probably never used .
it was assigned to the army reserves .
since 1963 it has served in the civil sphere .
and also as a ra@@ cing plane .
today it has its home hang@@ ar at the airport in Mni@@ ch@@ ově H@@ radi@@ šti .
in the same location there is another pe@@ ar@@ l of the Ch@@ eb Avi@@ ation Day , the two-@@ engine Be@@ ech@@ craft C@@ 4@@ 5@@ H Ex@@ ped@@ itor .
the enormous aircraft can not be overlooked at the airport .
its poli@@ shed alu@@ min@@ um co@@ ating sh@@ ines a long distance .
the Max Hol@@ ste M@@ H 15@@ 2@@ 1@@ M Bro@@ us@@ s@@ ard plane in the colors of the French Air Force has also received admiration .
the small air@@ liner got behind the ren@@ ounced Tur@@ bo@@ let , and from H@@ of , Germany , it brought home part of the German delegation at the air show .
Ch@@ eb '@@ s neighbors from the German side of the border gave performan@@ ces including some with re@@ constructed Jak 18@@ T aircraft and three-@@ member forma@@ tions using B@@ ü@@ cker J@@ ung@@ mann bi@@ planes .

exhibition in Prague in a year ?
the arena would be sold out , according to J@@ á@@ g@@ r '@@ s planned going away party .
`` It would be noble if something like this were done during the World Ch@@ ampi@@ on@@ ship .
but it will depend on what position the association takes , '@@ ' he said in Ji@@ hlava following the Golden match exhibition , during which the impressive team from the Nag@@ ano Olympics met again .
this included players who participated in the golden hat trick .
the players would be in the mood , would n@@ '@@ t they ?
certainly .
in short , it would be good to have a par@@ ting celebration with the golden generation during the champion@@ ship .
I believe that during the tourna@@ ment we can find one or two days when everyone will be completely free and a location where everyone could meet for such a match .
I '@@ ll tell G@@ uma -LRB- Ji@@ ří@@ mu Š@@ lé@@ g@@ rovi -RRB- or Bé@@ ď@@ ovi Š@@ čer@@ ban@@ ovi -LRB- the organiz@@ er of the Ji@@ hlava match -RRB- , would could take responsibility for it ...
the arena would be sold out .
but what if you '@@ re going to participate in the New Jer@@ sey pla@@ y-@@ off ?
then I '@@ ll fly in ...
but do you not want to play on the team ?
or has the Ji@@ hlava match somehow changed your mind ?
the team and exhibition matches are two different things , and performance is decisive in the team .
the only thing is that people would like to see me there , but performance is decisive , especially for the World Ch@@ ampi@@ on@@ ship .
it should be participated in by players who have what it takes , not because they have a good reputation .
my decision has not changed at all .
how did you enjoy the Nag@@ ano re@@ union ?
just meeting with the players was great .
each person recal@@ led events and had a lot of fun .
it was a great experience both for fans and for us ho@@ ckey players .
of course , the most important part was hon@@ oring Ivan H@@ lin@@ ka .
and it '@@ s good to remind everyone of the history of our ho@@ ckey , since one generation is leaving who really ca@@ red about it .
S@@ lav@@ omí@@ r Len@@ er , Vladimír R@@ ů@@ ži@@ čka and Pe@@ tr Čech@@ má@@ nek on the ben@@ ch .
do you yourself still remember your first team match ?
such things are impossible to forget .
it was against the Cal@@ g@@ ary fla@@ mes , and there were three young people , Robert Hol@@ ík , Robert Re@@ ich@@ el and I , and we joined in one group of three .
it was the first team start for everyone .
but it would be in@@ accurate to say that we dominated in any way .
Domini@@ k Ha@@ šek played the goal position in Ji@@ hlava after a long period .
what did you say about his performance ?
Ha@@ š@@ an never surprises me on the ice .
I wanted to give it back to him with criticism , but I can@@ '@@ t . -LRB- Ha@@ šek criticized J@@ á@@ g@@ ra for the reasons why he decided to quit the team . -RRB- He played the goal position excell@@ ently .
H@@ ni@@ lič@@ ka performed great too .
this was even though he trained with me at night once , and he had shortcomings .
now he played the goal position fanta@@ st@@ ically .

it will be followed by auto@@ gra@@ ph signing , at which neither Ros@@ ický nor Č@@ ech will be missing .
otherwise , of course , this meeting of the national team will be cal@@ mer .
this has been praised by co@@ ach V@@ r@@ ba , who in the spring complained about the number of community events .
we will finally be able to devote our attention to what we want to devote it to .
now we will focus on the Netherlands .
there is an advantage when you have players together for eight days .
we will have time to practice things that so far we have not had enough time for , '@@ ' said V@@ r@@ ba , who has headed the national team since January .
when entering the new quali@@ fication cycle , the Czech soccer team will be accompanied by a Mu@@ ske@@ te@@ er image .
the team under V@@ r@@ ba '@@ s leadership has three games behind it , all of them prepar@@ atory matches .
it tied with Norway and Finland 2 : 2 and lost to Austria 1 : 2 .
however , those results were not important any more .
only now .
with the match with the Netherlands , the quali@@ fication is beginning for advancement to the 2016 European Ch@@ ampi@@ on@@ ship .
of course , the Czech men '@@ s team would be aided if it managed the re@@ hear@@ s@@ al game against the USA .
`` The first year was for us to get to know each other .
now results are important .
we have to think about how we can be successful , '@@ ' said V@@ r@@ ba .
the only player in the 2@@ 3-@@ member nomination who has health problems is David Laf@@ ata .
he suffers from a fever .
if he does n@@ '@@ t manage to recover by the W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day game against the USA , co@@ ach V@@ r@@ ba could call up one more offensive player .
genetic disorder often mis@@ diagnosed
a British woman says she spent many years thinking she was going to die after a mis@@ diagnosis .
Kar@@ in Rod@@ gers spent most of her teen@@ age life believing that she only had years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease .
she actually had Char@@ cot@@ -@@ Mari@@ e-@@ To@@ o@@ th disease -LRB- CM@@ T -RRB- - a group of inherited disorders that damage ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ ine .
charity CM@@ T UK said that mis@@ diagnosis is a common problem among people with CM@@ T because so little is known about the condition .
about 2@@ 3,000 people in the UK are thought to have CM@@ T , which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness , an awkward ga@@ it and cur@@ led to@@ es .
suff@@ er@@ ers can also experience num@@ b@@ ness or pain and the condition is inc@@ u@@ rable and progressive , meaning symptoms get worse over time .
when Rod@@ gers was 13 she was under the impression that she suffered from Fried@@ re@@ ich '@@ s at@@ ax@@ ia -LRB- fa -RRB- - a condition which had a very poor prog@@ nos@@ is .
Rod@@ gers thought that she was going to be whe@@ el@@ chair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she reached her 3@@ 0s .
the mo@@ ther@@ -of-@@ two , who is now 51 , said : `` As a child I knew I could n@@ '@@ t do the same things as others .
I was falling daily and everything took me longer to do .
I could never rol@@ ler@@ -@@ sk@@ ate or sk@@ ate@@ board with other kids and got bul@@ lied at school a lot because of the way I wal@@ ked and ran .
Rod@@ gers said when she was aged 13 , after several operations to release her Achil@@ les tend@@ ons and straigh@@ ten out her feet , she took a peak at her medical notes when her consul@@ tant left the room which said that she suffered from fa .
`` I felt guilty because I '@@ d been nosy and so I did n@@ '@@ t tell anybody , but I did come home , look up the condition at the library and wrote to the fa Association , '@@ ' she said .
when I got the information back I was g@@ ob@@ sm@@ ac@@ ked and in the worst state of panic possible .
I thought I '@@ d be in a whe@@ el@@ chair at 18 and dead by the time I was 25 and in between gradually lose all my ability .
I was going through this on my own and I planned my own fun@@ eral .
she said by the time she reached 17 she real@@ ised that her walking abilities had n@@ '@@ t deteriorated as much as she thought they would have and asked her sur@@ ge@@ on about it .
he just stood up and hu@@ gged me and said ` my dear I do n@@ '@@ t think you have it , as you would be in a whe@@ el@@ chair now . '
I think you have something a lot less life threatening .
after some genetic testing she was found to have CM@@ T .
`` When he explained what CM@@ T was , I thought I '@@ d drawn the lucky stra@@ w , '@@ ' she said .
charity CM@@ T UK has launched CM@@ T awareness month to try to draw attention to the condition .
Washing@@ ton-@@ area business owners '@@ ' tax burden moun@@ ts as economy reboun@@ ds
a reboun@@ ding economy means more customers , higher sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax bills for companies across the country grew mode@@ stly last year as the economic recovery accelerated , according to new research released last week , and Washing@@ ton-@@ area firms were no exception .
district , Mary@@ land and Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia businesses collectively paid $ 27@@ .@@ 6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013 , an increase of 3.@@ 8 percent over the $ 2@@ 6.@@ 6 billion collected in 2012 .
businesses '@@ ' state and local tax burdens last year expanded by 4.3 percent , to $ 6@@ 71 billion , compared with 3.@@ 9 percent the year before , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after back@@ -to-@@ back years of shrinking bills in 2009 and 2010 .
state taxes rose at a faster cli@@ p , 4.3 percent , than local levi@@ es , 3.@@ 9 percent , according to the study , which was conducted by professional services firm Er@@ n@@ st & Young and the Center on State Ta@@ x@@ ation , a tax policy group .
more than half of the D@@ ist@@ ric@@ t '@@ s tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from business taxes , while 36 percent of Mary@@ land '@@ s revenue comes from firms .
Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , at 28 percent , generates the least amount of tax revenue , proportion@@ ately , from business .
much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a rebound in companies '@@ ' real estate values , researchers say , which pushed property taxes up 3.@@ 7 percent this year after three consecutive years of sub-@@ 1 percent growth .
while a large share of those gains came from big states such as California , New York and Texas , it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well .
companies in the D@@ ist@@ ric@@ t , Mary@@ land and Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia collectively for@@ ked over $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year , up from $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 - year-@@ over-@@ year growth of 4.@@ 2 percent .
but the apparent boun@@ ce@@ back in property values is n@@ '@@ t doing nearly as much to inf@@ late state and local tax revenues in Mary@@ land , where property taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of companies '@@ ' tax bills .
Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia and D@@ .C. firms pay nearly half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes .
`` What '@@ s happening in Mary@@ land is that so much of their property , especially the tax base surrounding the D@@ .C. area , is owned either by the government or by non@@ profits , which do n@@ '@@ t pay property taxes , '@@ ' said D@@ ou@@ gla@@ s L@@ ind@@ hol@@ m , executive director of the Center on State Ta@@ x@@ ation .
so Mary@@ land is forced to rely much more heavily on , for example , its income taxes to pay for the same services you have in other states .
the recent rebound in business tax revenue can not all be attributed to the recovering real estate market .
business incomes also appear to be on the men@@ d , according to the data .
companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $ 2.3 billion , up from $ 2.@@ 1 billion in 2012 .
Mary@@ land collected $ 1 billion in corporate income tax revenue , the most in the region .
while tr@@ ending in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses is n@@ '@@ t growing at the same pace in all three places .
the D@@ ist@@ ric@@ t '@@ s rate of growth was level with the national average , at 4.3 percent , while Mary@@ land '@@ s growth was substantially faster at 4.@@ 9 percent .
only Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia post@@ ed a bel@@ ow@@ -@@ average tax bill bu@@ mp of 4.@@ 1 percent .
Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia has the lowest corporate income tax by far of the three jurisdictions -LRB- all of which have flat corporate rates -RRB- at 6 percent .
Mary@@ land '@@ s corporate rate is 8.@@ 25 percent , while the D@@ ist@@ ric@@ t '@@ s stands at a relatively high 9.@@ 9@@ 75 percent .
a similar study by the U.S. Cham@@ ber of Com@@ mer@@ ce earlier this year showed that Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia had lower state and local business taxes and an overall better business tax climate than Mary@@ land .
the D@@ ist@@ ric@@ t was n@@ '@@ t evalu@@ ated in the study .
despite its advantage , Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south .
North Ca@@ rol@@ ina recently signed legislation lowering its corporate rate this year from 6.@@ 9 percent to 6 percent , in line with Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year .
if the state continues to meet revenue goals in the coming year , the law could push the state '@@ s business income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 20@@ 17 .
meanwhile , small businesses in the Washington region seem to be f@@ aring better and thus paying more state and local taxes , according to the recent study .
business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - the pas@@ s-@@ through structure by which most small firms are organized - in the D@@ ist@@ ric@@ t , Mary@@ land and Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia surged 20 percent last year to $ 2.4 billion , a much faster rate of growth than overall business taxes .
researchers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nationwide are likely to continue this year , with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.@@ 2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year .
however , the Washington area may lag behind as the slowdown in federal spending takes its toll on the region '@@ s labor market .
what you missed : Tu@@ sk to head Europe , Putin '@@ s Nov@@ oro@@ ssi@@ ya and Laf@@ ata '@@ s sci@@ ss@@ ors
will a new state emerge in Ukraine ?
Putin calls for negotiations about Nov@@ oro@@ ssi@@ ya
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in sou@@ theast Ukraine , where since April government forces have been cla@@ shing with pro@@ -Russian rebels .
he has also warned European companies that now that sanctions have been imposed against Russia , it will be difficult for them to return to the Russian market .
he says the support provided by the West to the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine conflicts with democratic values .
he says when the conflict will end will depend on Kiev , and so he can not say when the Ukrainian crisis will end .
more sanctions for Russia ?
the Czech Republic has reserved the right to disagree with parts of the sanctions .
the European Commission , together with diplomats , will propose within a week what form the next round of sanctions against Russia will take , it decided at the EU summit overnight .
this was told to reporters by Her@@ man V@@ an Rompu@@ y , the permanent chairman of meetings attended by member states .
according to Czech Prime Minister B@@ oh@@ us@@ la@@ v S@@ ob@@ ot@@ ka , the specific proposals for shifting the form of sanctions should be prepared already on M@@ ond@@ ay .
Tu@@ sk will be the new EU `` president . '@@ '
he will replace V@@ an Rompu@@ y in December .
at the EU summit , Polish Prime Minister Donald Tu@@ sk was elected chairman of the European Council , and is therefore the `` EU president , '@@ ' who over@@ sees top meetings attended by member states ' representatives .
as of December , he is replacing Her@@ man V@@ an Rompu@@ y for two and a half years .
Italian Foreign Minister Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini is replacing Ca@@ ther@@ ine Ash@@ ton as the top EU diplomat .
the Italian , who will become deputy cha@@ ir@@ woman of the future European Commission , still needs to be confirmed in the European Parliament before she can take over the position .
assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic that no one talks about .

Jo@@ an rivers ' F@@ am@@ ily Ke@@ eping ` Our fingers crossed '
Jo@@ an rivers has been un@@ conscious since her arrival three days ago at a New York City hospital , but her daughter expressed hope today that the 8@@ 1-@@ year-old com@@ ed@@ ian will recover from her illness .
`` T@@ han@@ k you for your continued love and support , '@@ ' M@@ eli@@ ss@@ a rivers said in a statement today .
we are keeping our fingers crossed .
her mother arrived at M@@ oun@@ t Sinai Ho@@ sp@@ ital T@@ hur@@ sday after an emergency call that she was in car@@ di@@ ac arrest at an Up@@ per East Si@@ de clin@@ ic , Yor@@ kv@@ ille En@@ do@@ sc@@ op@@ y , sources said .
doctors are inten@@ tionally keeping her sed@@ ated and under close supervision until they '@@ re more comfortable with her condition , which remains `` serious . '@@ '
reaction has been widespread , including overwhelming online support from the likes of Donald trump , Mon@@ tel Willi@@ ams and Kel@@ ly Ri@@ pa .
reality is distorted by headlines
the fact that media organizations distort reality with their headlines is -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- nothing new .
I know that headlines `` sell '@@ ' newspapers , but unfortunately I also know that there are a lot of so-called `` readers '@@ ' who do n@@ '@@ t read anything .
and it '@@ s a fact that has really bo@@ thered me recently , or , better put , inf@@ uri@@ ates me .
it has to do with , for example , articles about the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip .
headlines such as `` Israel attacks Gaza '@@ ' are entirely common .
first you read in the text that the Israeli `` attack '@@ ' was a reaction to rockets being fired from Gaza , often during the declared ceasefire .
then you get to a headline that says `` Bo@@ th sides violate ceasefire . '@@ '
does the journ@@ alistic profession realize that with their approach they are directly contributing to anti-Semitic sentiment , which is growing all over Europe -LRB- and not only there -RRB- .
it has n@@ '@@ t been even sixty years since the end of the Second World War .
there are still people alive who survived the Holocaust .
when I saw a video from the Federal Republic of Germany , where a crowd was sh@@ ou@@ ting things like `` Jewish sw@@ ine '@@ ' and similar desp@@ ic@@ able phra@@ ses , it struck me .
does the world want to finish what Hitler did n@@ '@@ t manage to ?
do our journalists realize that after the Jews , the S@@ lav@@ s were targeted for liquid@@ ation ?
ladi@@ es and gentle@@ men in the journalist profession , please be a bit more careful in your work .
you are often referred to as `` watch@@ dogs of democracy . '@@ '
so enhance that .
while it '@@ s still here .
and also promote the right of the only truly democratic country in the Middle East to defend its population .
how would you want our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided that it wanted to liquid@@ ate the Czech nation and er@@ ase the Czech Republic from the world '@@ s map ?
maybe you should realize one more fact .
nearly 20 % of the Arabs on Israel '@@ s territory have Israeli citizenship .
and they feel good there .
when you ask them why they do n@@ '@@ t go to be among `` their own , '@@ ' for example to Gaza , they will ask you why they should .
in Israel , they have work , social certain@@ ties and top quality health care -LRB- I have seen with my own eyes how Arabs too go to the top quality Had@@ ass@@ a hospital , which is financed from spon@@ sorship donations from Jews around the world , and those Arabs are understandably treated there -RRB- .
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its rockets .
the only true way of helping Gaza , and the tense region , is to remove and disarm Hamas .
and not to condemn Israel , even if only indirectly through headlines .
get informed about Hamas ' practices and its use of people as human shi@@ elds .
get informed that Hamas ' goal is to liquid@@ ate the State of Israel at any cost .
even if it causes the death of innocent Arab children .
get informed that Hamas is on the list of global terrorist organizations .
get informed that in the nine years of self-@@ governance in Gaza , it could have blo@@ ss@@ omed thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world .
even from Israel , which supplies water and electricity , for which of course the rulers of Gaza do n@@ '@@ t pay , and then they even get upset when power supplies are sometimes interrupted .
if Hamas did not invest its money into constructing underground tun@@ ne@@ ls to enable suicide bombers to penetra@@ te into Israel , but instead into activities such as construction of residential housing , hospitals and schools , its Arab brothers from Gaza would live much better .
Amazon buys Twit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion
Amazon just confirmed what the In@@ formation reported M@@ ond@@ ay morning : the online re@@ tail@@ er - and video producer , and a hundred other things - is buying video stre@@ aming service Twit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion -LRB- $ US@@ 9@@ 70 million -RRB- .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected Twit@@ ch to be bought , but because You@@ Tu@@ be was widely expected to be the buyer .
three months ago the sale of Twit@@ ch to Google '@@ s video service , for a cool billion , looked all w@@ rap@@ ped up , and the pa@@ iring seemed natural .
Twit@@ ch , founded only three years ago as Just@@ in@@ .@@ t@@ v , set out to be a general stre@@ aming service - a live version of You@@ Tu@@ be .
instead , it quickly became a platform for gam@@ ers to broadcast their in-@@ game fe@@ ats ; a `` You@@ Tu@@ be for live gam@@ ing , '@@ ' in Business insider '@@ s words .
Twit@@ ch '@@ s inter@@ face .
and `` let '@@ s play , '@@ ' a gen@@ re of vide@@ os in which wi@@ se@@ ac@@ res give -LRB- mostly older -RRB- games the mystery Science The@@ ater treatment , are already popular on You@@ Tu@@ be .
the point is , You@@ Tu@@ be comes up a lot when describing Twit@@ ch , so the news that You@@ Tu@@ be was acquiring Twit@@ ch was greeted with a y@@ a@@ wn , a textbook example of an entrenched tech company buying out a potential competi@@ tor .
it '@@ s a mystery why the deal with You@@ Tu@@ be fell through , considering it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon .
all we have at the moment is this statement from Twit@@ ch CEO Em@@ met@@ t S@@ hear : `` We chose Amazon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us get there faster . '@@ '
another mystery , frankly , is Twit@@ ch '@@ s incredible success .
to s@@ no@@ bs like me who declare that they '@@ d rather play sports than watch them , it '@@ s hard to see the appeal of watching games rather than taking up a control@@ ler myself .
it '@@ s one thing to look over your friend '@@ s shoulder at 3 in the morning as she cre@@ ep@@ s through re@@ sident Ev@@ il , and quite another to watch some ran@@ do get 20 head@@ sh@@ ots in a row in C@@ all of duty .
all the games you could be watching right now .
another problem is that many of today '@@ s most popular games are first-@@ person , so watching foot@@ age of them , without controlling the view@@ point yourself , can be a Do It R@@ igh@@ t-@@ worthy recipe for a head@@ ach@@ e .
I concede that spe@@ ed@@ runs , in which the R@@ og@@ er Ban@@ n@@ ist@@ ers of our electronic age complete entire games in record time , are enter@@ taining .
but unless someone is a virtu@@ o@@ so at gam@@ ing or hum@@ our , his Twit@@ ch channel is n@@ '@@ t likely to be all that interesting .
but what do scep@@ tics like me know ?
Twit@@ ch has 55 million unique visitors monthly and is the four@@ th-@@ largest source of peak internet traffic .
how , exactly , will Amazon capit@@ ali@@ se on this ?
it '@@ s hard to imagine Twit@@ ch being fol@@ ded into Amazon instant V@@ ide@@ o as eleg@@ antly as You@@ Tu@@ be could have just sw@@ allowed Twit@@ ch .
but Twit@@ ch has something any company would love to attract : hor@@ des of adver@@ ti@@ ser@@ -@@ cov@@ eted young men .
as Twit@@ ch chief S@@ hear said , Amazon and Twit@@ ch `` are both believers in the future of gam@@ ing , '@@ ' and the medium shows no sign of shrinking , even - gul@@ p - as a spec@@ tat@@ or sport .
the Second foun@@ da@@ tional fal@@ se@@ hood of crea@@ tionism .
another trans@@ lation into Czech of a writing by American athe@@ ist vlo@@ gg@@ er A@@ ron@@ R@@ a .
this time on the topic : `` S@@ cri@@ p@@ tures are the Wor@@ d of God . '@@ '
original video attached .
the 2@@ n@@ d foun@@ da@@ tional fal@@ se@@ hood of crea@@ tionism is the belief that sacred scrip@@ tures were written by a g@@ od rather than by the actual human authors .
when believers argue over any of the many things which contradic@@ t their religion , they often challenge us to decide whom we are going to believe .
the alleged `` word '@@ ' of God ? or that of M@@ en ?
as if human inquiry had no chance against the authority they imagine their doctrine to be .
but when they say , `` men , '@@ ' they '@@ re talking about science .
and when they refer to the `` word of God , '@@ ' they '@@ re talking about myths written about God by men .
if there really is an intelligent and pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful cre@@ ator , then it would have to be he who constructed the fossil record revealing evolutionary history , and he has to be the one who conceived the genetic patterns which also trace that same course , and it must have been he who added the other lines of evidence which point to the evolutionary conclusion exclusively and in brilliant detail .
why else would all these things exist ?
it '@@ s as if he were trying to tell us something !
men could n@@ '@@ t create any of those things .
but men can tell stories , wh@@ op@@ p@@ ers in fact .
and it was men who wrote all the scrip@@ tures preten@@ ding to speak for God .
every one of the world '@@ s supposedly `` holy '@@ ' doctrines of any religion describe themselves as being written by men , not g@@ ods .
men who were `` moved by '@@ ' or inspired by their favorite g@@ ods , or perhaps taking dic@@ tation from ang@@ els , but they were written by low@@ ly imag@@ in@@ ative yet imperfect mort@@ als none the less ; not by ang@@ els , and certainly not by g@@ ods .
if there really was one true g@@ od , it should be a sing@@ ular com@@ posite of every religion '@@ s g@@ ods , an u@@ ber@@ -@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic super-@@ genius , and the ultimate entity of the entire cosmo@@ s .
if a being of that magnitude ever wrote a book , then there would only be one such document ; one book of God .
it would be dominant everywhere in the world with no predecessors or parallels or alternatives in any language , because mere human authors could n@@ '@@ t possibly compete with it .
and you would n@@ '@@ t need faith to believe it , because it would be consistent with all evidence and demonstra@@ bly true , revealing profound morality and wisdom far beyond contemporary human capacity .
it would invariably inspire a unity of common belief for every read@@ er .
if God wrote it , we could expect no less .
but what we see instead is the very opposite of that .
instead of only one religion leading to one ultimate truth , we have many different religions with no common origin , all constantly shar@@ ding into ever more dee@@ ply@@ -@@ divided denomin@@ ations , seeking conflicting truths , and each somehow claiming divine guidance despite their ongoing divergence in every direction .
the Jewish Tor@@ ah , the Christian Go@@ sp@@ els , the Q@@ ur@@ '@@ an of Islam , the K@@ it@@ ab@@ -@@ i-@@ A@@ q@@ d@@ as of Ba@@ há@@ '@@ u@@ '@@ l@@ láh , the Hindu Ved@@ as , the A@@ vest@@ as of Zar@@ a@@ thu@@ stra , the A@@ di@@ -@@ Gran@@ th of the S@@ ik@@ hs , the Ma@@ hab@@ ar@@ ata '@@ s B@@ ha@@ g@@ av@@ ad@@ -@@ G@@ ita , the Bo@@ ok of M@@ orm@@ on , and the U@@ ran@@ tia book are all declared to be the `` absolute truth '@@ ' and the `` revealed word '@@ ' of the `` one true '@@ ' g@@ od , and believers of each say the others are decei@@ ved .
the only logical probability is that they all are â € '@@ ' at least to some degree .
none of these have any particular advantage over the others .
none of them have any ev@@ identi@@ ary support , and none of them are historically veri@@ fiable .
`` I '@@ m Dr. Paul Ma@@ ier , professor of ancient history at Western Mich@@ ig@@ an University .
I '@@ m not saying that now I have proven the Bi@@ ble is authorit@@ ative , is accurate historically .
of course not .
you still have to have faith . '@@ '
all of them require faith , and apolo@@ ge@@ tics as well , because they also contain in@@ consist@@ encies , absur@@ di@@ ties , and primitive notions once held true but which have since been dis@@ proved .
so they can claim no evidence of divine wisdom .
many of them promote he@@ inous atrocities in place of morality , and many claim to be vali@@ dated by prophec@@ ies now fulfilled â € '@@ ' where each may also contain prop@@ he@@ sies which failed to come to pass as predicted .
leading the@@ ologi@@ ans admit that all of the scrip@@ tures of any religion were written by human hands and were thus subject to the interpretations , im@@ pres@@ sions and per@@ spec@@ tives of their primitive and often prejud@@ ic@@ ed and politic@@ ally-@@ motivated authors , and they cite this as the explanation behind many of the contradictions in those books , especially those in the Bi@@ ble .
`` Well I would n@@ '@@ t call them contradictions as much as comment@@ aries , the one on the other .
again , let '@@ s point out , we probably do have two different authors here who '@@ s work was b@@ len@@ ded together then in editorial revi@@ sion@@ ing somewhat . '@@ '
he '@@ s right about there being more than one author for Gen@@ es@@ is , and it was definitely not an eye@@ witness account !
some experts now recognize four different sources just for the P@@ ent@@ ate@@ u@@ ch , the five books of `` Mos@@ es , '@@ ' and they do n@@ '@@ t credit Mos@@ es as the author of any of them as he evidently never existed as described .
the schol@@ arly consensus is that Gen@@ es@@ is was comp@@ iled , -LRB- probably by E@@ z@@ ra -RRB- from several unrelated or@@ al traditions less than 2,@@ 500 years ago .
other documents fil@@ tered in at the same time , all of which attributed to human authors .
the Bi@@ ble is nowhere near as old as believers say it is !
the De@@ ad Sea sc@@ rolls are the oldest archa@@ e@@ ological texts known for the still un@@ finished basis of all of western mono@@ the@@ ism , yet they '@@ re each centuries younger than the origins of Zo@@ ro@@ ast@@ ri@@ an , Buddhist , Hindu , Hel@@ len@@ ist , Dru@@ id@@ ic , Chinese and Egyptian religions .
Christianity began with the G@@ nost@@ ic faith , and then the D@@ oce@@ tics , and E@@ bi@@ oni@@ tes , and their completely different per@@ spec@@ tives of Je@@ sus were eventually combined into a kind of compromise called Or@@ thodoxy .
other Christian sub@@ sets like the Lu@@ cifer@@ ians were over@@ run and discredited by further Bi@@ b@@ lical revi@@ sions .
one of these revi@@ sions rela@@ tes to the king of U@@ gar@@ it around 3,@@ 500 years ago .
as his followers were the principle competition with the emerging religion of Mos@@ es , scri@@ bes working on the New T@@ est@@ ament chose to demon@@ ize Ba@@ '@@ al Ze@@ Bu@@ l , the `` Lord on High , '@@ ' by distorting his name to Be@@ el@@ ze@@ bu@@ b , the `` Lord of the flies . '@@ '
so the Bi@@ ble has been deliberately and de@@ cep@@ tively altered for both religious and political reasons .
the rest of what became the New T@@ est@@ ament was can@@ onized in the 4@@ th century in a series of committee decisions at a convention at Nic@@ e@@ a .
four Go@@ sp@@ els were accepted and six@@ teen more were rejected , all by a show of hands , as if the facts of the matter could be evalu@@ ated or dismissed by popular vote .
`` The way the can@@ on developed was by what was being read on Sunday in the centers of Christianity .
what do you read on the 2@@ n@@ d Sunday after East@@ er in the church in Jerusalem ?
what '@@ s the church of Rome reading at this time ?
and they found that again and again , they were zer@@ o@@ ing in on the same stories in the Go@@ sp@@ els .
and so the core of the can@@ on kind of developed from the usage of the early church . '@@ '
so the council simply accepted as go@@ sp@@ el whatever few relevant stories the une@@ du@@ cated masses happened to like at that time .
but they still opted to remove more than a dozen books from the Bi@@ ble even though they were still referen@@ ced by other books they chose to include .
among the rejected items were the writings of both a@@ post@@ les and prop@@ he@@ ts .
why would God '@@ s word refer us to other books which were some human '@@ s word , and@@ /@@ or are no longer available ?
who were the real editors here ?
the Bi@@ ble often names human authors .
but how could it make such an admission if God were the real author and editor of this hap@@ hazard j@@ um@@ ble of F@@ ables , par@@ ables , and ps@@ al@@ m ly@@ ric@@ s ?
the Bi@@ ble was very definitely written by men , and not superior men either ; far from it !
this is why so much of it can be shown to be historically and scientifically dead wrong about dam@@ ne@@ d-@@ near everything back@@ -to-@@ front .
we '@@ re talking about people who believe s@@ nak@@ es and don@@ keys can talk , who believe in inc@@ an@@ tations , blood sacrifice , ritual sp@@ ells , en@@ chan@@ ted arti@@ facts , py@@ ro@@ tech@@ nic po@@ tions , astro@@ logy , and the five elements of wit@@ ch@@ craft .
they thought that if you use a magic w@@ and to s@@ prin@@ kle blood all over someone , it will cure them of le@@ pro@@ sy .
we '@@ re talking about people who think that rab@@ bits ch@@ ew cu@@ d , and that b@@ ats are birds , and whales are fish , and that P@@ i is a round number .
these fol@@ ks believed that if you display stri@@ ped patterns to a pregnant cow , it would bare stri@@ ped cal@@ ves .
how could anyone say that who knows anything about genetics ?
obviously the authors of this book did n@@ '@@ t .
if the Bi@@ ble had been written by a supreme being , then it would n@@ '@@ t contain the mistakes that it does .
if it was written by a truly superior being , and meant to be read as a liter@@ al history , then the Bi@@ ble would n@@ '@@ t contain anything that it does .
as a moral guide , it utterly fails , because much of the original He@@ bre@@ w scrip@@ tures were written by ignorant and big@@ oted sav@@ ages who con@@ don@@ ed and promoted animal cruelty , in@@ cest , slavery , abuse of sla@@ ves , spo@@ usal abuse , child abuse , child mole@@ station , abortion , p@@ illa@@ ge , murder , c@@ anni@@ bal@@ ism , genocide , and prejudice against race , nationality , religion , sex , and sexual orientation .
to justify their own in@@ humanity by claiming to do the will of God .
but crea@@ tionists still continue to ignore all of that .
some of their sites even admit that wherever reality conflicts with the Bi@@ ble , then reality must be ignored !
and why is that ?
because if crea@@ tionists did n@@ '@@ t have their bel@@ ov@@ ed books , they would n@@ '@@ t have a g@@ od either .
one is the other in their world .
ironically , the faithful reject the `` works '@@ ' of God as `` wor@@ shipping creation over the cre@@ ator . '@@ '
but then they prop up the words of men before God , as God , and even insist that dis@@ proving their supposedly `` holy '@@ ' books would somehow dis@@ prove God too .
not just their version of God , but everyone else '@@ s version of God as well .
Cre@@ a@@ tionist Christians think that if the Bi@@ ble is wrong , then God lied .
they can not accept that God could exist but the Bi@@ ble be wrong because they ca n@@ '@@ t distinguish doctrine from de@@ ity .
so it is a form of i@@ dola@@ try where@@ in the believers wor@@ ship man-made comp@@ il@@ ations as though those books were God himself -@@ because they think it is his word .
but God never wrote or dictated any of the scrip@@ tures of any religion .
everything men chose to reject from or include in their supposedly `` in@@ alter@@ able word '@@ ' of whatever g@@ od was conceived , composed , comp@@ iled , translated , interpreted , ed@@ ited , and often deliberately altered and enhanced by mere fal@@ li@@ ble men .

Apple i@@ C@@ loud reportedly hac@@ ked , naked celebrity photos le@@ aked
S@@ cre@@ en@@ shot with a list of le@@ aked files
a so far anonymous user on the 4@@ ch@@ an web@@ site has been publishing naked and even pornogra@@ phic photos of American celebri@@ ties , the U.S. web@@ site Ma@@ sh@@ ab@@ le@@ .com reports .
it reportedly gained u@@ nau@@ th@@ ori@@ zed access to user accounts on Apple '@@ s serv@@ ers , where the affected users had up@@ loaded them via automatic back@@ -@@ ups of images from i@@ P@@ hon@@ es and i@@ P@@ ads .
Apple has not yet com@@ mented about the problem .
some celebri@@ ties are denying the authen@@ tic@@ ity of the pictures , say they are for@@ ger@@ ies , but others have already admitted that they are genuine .
they include ac@@ tre@@ ss J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence , known from the title role of Kat@@ n@@ iss in the `` Hun@@ ger Games '@@ ' movie series and M@@ ary Eli@@ za@@ be@@ th W@@ instead , who has played in movies such as `` D@@ ie hard 4.@@ 0 . '@@ '
the h@@ ack@@ er '@@ s aim is to use the photos and vide@@ os to get rich .
interest in them has reportedly been expressed by American magaz@@ ines , but according to report on 4@@ ch@@ an , the h@@ ack@@ er would rather get money from the community .
according to the web@@ site The N@@ ex@@ t Web , the incident is very likely due to a weakness in security of the i@@ C@@ loud .
two days ago , a tool reported on the web@@ site G@@ it@@ Hu@@ b , which made it possible to gain pass@@ words to user accounts through bru@@ te force , by automatically repeating log@@ -@@ in attempts with various pass@@ words .
that tool prov@@ ably worked , but Apple pat@@ ched the hole two days later .
however , it is clear that potential attac@@ kers had a lot of time to gain access to various accounts before the tool was made available to the public .
as a preventive precau@@ tion , i@@ C@@ loud users should change their Apple I@@ D pass@@ words .
what '@@ s important is the length of the pass@@ word , not how complex it is .
a good length is at least 12 charac@@ ters .
the le@@ ak of naked photos of celebri@@ ties can be considered a reminder of the need to use online services secu@@ rely .
although the serv@@ ers of companies such as Apple , Google and Microsoft are secured much better than computers in homes and small companies , up@@ lo@@ ading of sensitive photographs in un@@ protected form is an unnecessary risk .
if you want to back up explicit photos or any sensitive cont@@ ents online , you should en@@ cry@@ pt the files before up@@ lo@@ ading them .
it also makes sense to set up automatic back@@ -@@ ups from a phone in a way that ensures that they occur only over Wi@@ F@@ i and after the phone is connected to a char@@ ger .
that way you will be able to move sensitive photos to a `` safe place '@@ ' in time , and mainly you will have time to dele@@ te bad photos , so they will not unnecessarily take up space in online storage services .
we are offering readers of H@@ N and I@@ H@@ NE@@ D@@ .@@ c@@ z a guide explaining how to en@@ cry@@ pt files and communication in the form of an e-@@ book by Mich@@ al Al@@ ta@@ ir Val@@ á@@ ška in P@@ D@@ F format .
smart ways to save on college textbooks
with the cost of college textbooks sur@@ passing $ 1,000 a year for many students , so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be sop@@ hom@@ ore Mat@@ t Schroeder came up with a smart way to tri@@ m costs .
he worked out a system of borrowing books from up@@ per@@ class@@ men , offering nominal compensation to get them to delay selling them back .
`` My calculus book that usually costs $ 180 , I got for the sem@@ est@@ er for $ 10 and a Ch@@ ick@@ -@@ fil@@ -@@ A bis@@ cu@@ it , '@@ ' says Schroeder , 19 , who atten@@ ds C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant College in Georgia .
required texts for his last sem@@ est@@ er would have cost $ 4@@ 30 , he says .
he spent $ 120 .
the College Board says the average student will spend more than $ 1,@@ 200 a year on textbooks and school supplies , but students have a variety of options for managing these costs .
online outlets and creative approaches like Schroeder '@@ s are increasingly the go@@ -@@ to choices for students .
R@@ enting textbooks is on the rise , allowing students to use a book for the sem@@ est@@ er , often at a significant discount to buying .
Ne@@ e@@ bo In@@ c , which operates more than 250 cam@@ pus book@@ stores , says textbook rent@@ als have doubled since 2011 .
industry research shows that about one-@@ fourth of books at college book@@ stores in this past spring sem@@ est@@ er were ren@@ ted , says Ne@@ e@@ bo Vice President Tre@@ vor M@@ ey@@ er .
fewer than half of all texts are purchased at cam@@ pus book@@ stores , according to the National Association of College stores trade association .
here is the 10@@ 1 on the best ways to score a deal .
buying online
some new book prices can be one-third of what you might find at the cam@@ pus book@@ store if you go online .
the nin@@ th edi@@ tion of `` calculus '@@ ' by R@@ on Lar@@ son , Bru@@ ce Ed@@ wards , and Robert H@@ ost@@ et@@ ler carries a list price of nearly $ 2@@ 90 but can be purchased new for $ 2@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 99 at speci@@ alty textbook re@@ tail@@ er Ch@@ egg@@ .com .
buying used
if you do not mind other people '@@ s notes or wear and te@@ ar , used texts are a good option .
`` calculus '@@ ' is selling for $ 9@@ 3.@@ 49 used on Ch@@ egg@@ .com .
Mat@@ t Cas@@ ad@@ ay , 25 , a senior at Brig@@ ham Young University , says he had paid 42 cents on Amaz@@ on@@ .com for a used copy of `` Strategic Media decisions : understanding The Business En@@ d O@@ f The advertising Business . '@@ '
the book was selling for $ 48 new .
academics like In@@ grid Bra@@ ce@@ y , director of the University of Massachusetts at Am@@ her@@ st '@@ s College Wi@@ th@@ out walls , suggest students check with their professors to see if previous edi@@ tions are acceptable .
sometimes the up@@ dates are not relevant to the class@@ work .
if so , old edi@@ tions can often be found for a tiny fraction of the cost of the latest version .
besides Ch@@ egg and Amazon , e@@ Bay In@@ c '@@ s Hal@@ f@@ .com is a popular alternative for used books .
R@@ enting
R@@ enting your textbooks is worth considering if you take reasonable care of them , you remember to return them and you do not care to own them after you complete the class .
you can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of buying a book new .
for example , a student could rent `` calculus '@@ ' for the length of the sem@@ est@@ er for about $ 20 .
know the rules of the store you rent from , including any penalties you could be assessed for taking notes , highlighting , or wear and te@@ ar .
R@@ enter , be@@ ware : if you fail to return the book , penalties can actually exceed the cost of buying it new .
E@@ -@@ books
getting e-@@ books instead of traditional texts is another option .
sometimes those books are essentially ren@@ ted by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distribu@@ tors such as Amaz@@ on@@ .com , Ch@@ egg and Bar@@ nes & noble In@@ c .
Ch@@ egg will rent `` calculus '@@ ' for six months for about $ 61 .
Bra@@ ce@@ y says students in literature classes can often find the best bar@@ gains since many class@@ ics are now available to down@@ load for free , while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive .
no matter what , shop around .
Joe Ga@@ ult , 29 , who is about to enter P@@ ep@@ per@@ d@@ ine Law School , recommen@@ ds using the IS@@ B@@ N number to price books since it ensures you are shopping for the right text .
before ordering online , Ga@@ ult says , be sure to check if the book is actually in stock .
he learned that lesson the hard way .
a book he purchased was back@@ -@@ ordered for four weeks , and he ended up paying full price at the college book@@ store .
mu@@ d , nothing but mu@@ d .
and then in a well they found the tor@@ so of a ri@@ f@@ le from the end of the war .
that well is located not far from the Church of St. George .
`` We uncovered the surrounding ve@@ ge@@ tation and began pulling out an aged de@@ position , about a meter and a half of mu@@ d and rot@@ ten leaves .
when we got close to the cla@@ y bottom , we reached a barrel , '@@ ' Rad@@ om@@ il N@@ ová@@ k recal@@ led .
we pulled it out , clean@@ ed it and discovered that it was the tor@@ so of a German assault ri@@ f@@ le used by S@@ S units .
the finding was reportedly unusual .
`` Accor@@ ding to information available to me , these types of ri@@ f@@ les were not manufactured until near the end of the war .
and there were about 300,000 of them , '@@ ' N@@ ová@@ k added .
all items built with wood eventually de@@ com@@ pose , and therefore it is not us@@ able .
of course , its body has been preserved and retains its shape .
how did it end up in the well ?
one explanation exists .
`` maybe people who needed to get rid of weapons used by the S@@ S threw it in their , probably out of fear of being expelled .
fas@@ cists fleeing certainly did not do it .
they discarded weapons in the forest , '@@ ' say the founders .
the ri@@ f@@ le was the only thing found in the well by the fin@@ ders , members of the J@@ es@@ en@@ íky chapter of Fri@@ ends of the Earth .
`` There could have been hand g@@ ren@@ ades there as well , since there used to be a lot of them everywhere around , and therefore we slowed dig@@ ging work and carefully si@@ fted through the mu@@ d , so that nothing unfortunate would happen , but there was nothing else down there , '@@ ' N@@ ová@@ k said .
the finding will end up in the depos@@ itory of a museum at a ch@@ ate@@ au in nearby S@@ le@@ z@@ ských Rud@@ ol@@ tic@@ ích .
Ukrainian general : I have not yet freed the captured Czech
an exclusive interview by Ak@@ tu@@ álně@@ .@@ c@@ z with General Vol@@ od@@ y@@ my@@ r Ru@@ ban , who is freeing Ukrainian soldiers from cap@@ tivity by pro@@ -Russian separatists .
Ki@@ ev@@ /@@ Prague - `` excuse me , I have to pick it up ... they are calling me from Don@@ et@@ sk , '@@ ' he said , apologi@@ zing perhaps eight times during an exclusive interview conducted by Ak@@ tu@@ álně@@ .@@ c@@ z with Ukrainian General Vol@@ od@@ y@@ my@@ r Ru@@ ban , who is also the director of the local Center for Liberation of P@@ ris@@ oners of War .
general Vol@@ od@@ y@@ my@@ r Ru@@ ban in a television debate .
during each such interrup@@ tion , it was not possible to hear the names of the people , their numbers and locations , where they are - or where they should be - which Ru@@ ban will clear up with his counterpart on the other end of the phone line .
`` That '@@ s right , go there , '@@ ' he said , ending a quick discussion with someone in Don@@ et@@ sk , and then he focused on ours again .
Vol@@ od@@ y@@ my@@ r Ru@@ ban is a general in the reserves , a former fighter plane pilot and was an active particip@@ ant in the Ma@@ id@@ an protests .
still yesterday , when we arran@@ ged our interview , he was in Don@@ et@@ sk .
he de@@ votes himself to freeing Ukrainian soldiers captured by pro@@ -Russian separatists 24 hours a day .
Ak@@ tu@@ álně@@ .@@ c@@ z : perhaps you know that there are also Czechs fighting on the pro@@ -Russian separatists ' side .
our counter-@@ intelligence service estimates that there are up to 30 of them .
but of course , there could be many more .
have you already encountered any Czech prisoners of war during your negotiations ?
Vol@@ od@@ y@@ my@@ r Ru@@ ban : I have already freed captured Serbs , Dag@@ est@@ anis , Chechens , one Swed@@ e and a Georgian , but not a Czech yet .
but I know whom to turn to in Prague if we encounter one of your country@@ men among prisoners of war and how to free him .
a Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A@@ .@@ c@@ z : what advice would you give to Czechs who join the pro@@ -Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian soldiers ?
they should understand that if they are fighting as Czechs under Ukrainian ban@@ ners of volunte@@ ers and separatists capture them , then after questioning them they will be shot without a par@@ don , just like any other foreig@@ ner .
the separatists consider these men to be mer@@ cen@@ aries , and they say such people do n@@ '@@ t deserve anything other than death .
but if , for example , Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Don@@ et@@ sk separatists and there is , for example , a Czech among them , they will put him behind bars and negotiate with him as a prisoner of war .
in short , that man will live .
the Ukrainian side beha@@ ves like a country even in war .
A@@ .@@ c@@ z : and how many Ukrainian prisoners of war have you already managed to rescue ?
if I understand well , by ex@@ changing .
some sources say that the number exceeded a hundred men just recently .
long ago , we already stopped counting how many people we '@@ ve helped .
we just freed them , we did not rescue them from war if they decided to continue in battles .
the rescu@@ ers in a war are doctors , sur@@ ge@@ ons , but certainly not us .
that is how it was .
and every day there are more and more .
every day we rescue someone .
sometimes one person , and sometimes four or five .
and there is n@@ '@@ t always an exchange involved .
sometimes just a mere human request is enough to gain the release of prisoners .
A@@ .@@ c@@ z : word has it that in just a few months you have gained a lot of authority in dealings with the pro@@ -Russian separatists and even their trust , just like in Ukrainian society .
how did you manage to earn respect from both war@@ ring parties ?
that '@@ s a difficult question .
one of the officers in Kiev has given me the n@@ ick@@ name `` the crazy general with steel bal@@ ls . '@@ '
that does n@@ '@@ t off@@ end me .
but perhaps it highlights the basis of our work .
as the head of the Ukrainian Off@@ ic@@ ers Association , I had already earned certain authority previously .
I never take advantage of people , I never che@@ at , and I always keep my word .
no matter what '@@ s happening , I act honestly and tell the truth .
I do so even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government or for the representatives in Don@@ et@@ sk or Lu@@ han@@ sk .
and if they torture and kill people ?
then I simply tell them that they are tor@@ turing and killing .
and that those are crimes .
at the same time , they often risk their lives , and they even impressed me during prisoner swaps ... this work can be the end for me at any time ... I do n@@ '@@ t have to return to it .
A@@ .@@ c@@ z : how many execu@@ tions and incidents of torture of prisoners are you aware of ?
... -LRB- long pause -RRB- ... Bo@@ th Ukrainians and separatists resort to tor@@ turing prisoners during questioning .
unfortunately .
and execu@@ tions ?
they take place only on the Don@@ et@@ sk side .
I do n@@ '@@ t have any information about the Ukrainian army exec@@ uting any prisoners .
I do n@@ '@@ t have any information either to suggest that the Ukrainian army would even resort to such a tactic .
we have a guess about the number of execu@@ tions , but I can neither give you any numbers , nor do I want to .
A@@ .@@ c@@ z : please describe to me the character among the pro@@ -Russian separatist and their motives .
they include officers and even veterans from Afghanistan .
they are seeking independence and perhaps even democracy in Don@@ et@@ sk or Lu@@ han@@ sk , or at least they say so .
they no longer want to play their cards with the Ukrainian oligarchs .
the separatists have had enough of the oligarchs an are their un@@ wav@@ ering opponents , for life and death .
as we say , they '@@ re up to their ne@@ cks .
by the way , the same dreams and wishes were expressed by people at the Ma@@ id@@ an .
and now there is some speculation : Russia is supporting the separatists , and the West is supporting Ukraine .
I consider one speculation large and the other small .
but just that sentence hi@@ des within it an im@@ pla@@ cable dispute .
A@@ .@@ c@@ z : for example , what '@@ s your impression of one of the tough@@ est leaders of the pro@@ -Russian separatists , Igor Bez@@ ler ?
whenever I cross the front line , I '@@ m un@@ armed and raise my bare hands to soldier and rebels .
and both sides always have me within a range of 200 or 300 meters of their sight or op@@ tical sen@@ sor .
I can always well see the faces of the people who approach me , and they can press the trigg@@ ers on their weapons at any time .
Par@@ atro@@ op@@ er and experienced col@@ onel of both German and Ukrainian descent .
he considers himself a Russian officer , even though his family -LRB- mother -RRB- lives in Ukraine .
he thinks Ukraine should n@@ '@@ t exist .
and if so , then as a small col@@ ony in a vast Russian Empire .
in any case , he keeps talking about it , and he considers Ukraine somehow to be result of a certain mis@@ understanding .
he says such a state should not exist .
he is also an un@@ wav@@ ering enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs .
A@@ .@@ c@@ z : speaking of charac@@ ters , in a Ukrainian TV discussion show you described your prime minister , Ar@@ seni@@ y Y@@ at@@ sen@@ yu@@ k , as a weak , clu@@ e@@ less and tired `` leader '@@ ' who would do best if he left quickly .
in walking three meters , I always become scared at least five@@ fold .
why should I conce@@ al my opinion that Y@@ at@@ sen@@ yu@@ k is a very weak prime minister and is h@@ arming our country ?
A@@ .@@ c@@ z : do you believe he is a particip@@ ant in the war in Ukraine ?
perhaps you know that the Ukrainians call Y@@ at@@ sen@@ yu@@ k a `` rab@@ bit . '@@ '
a rab@@ bit in the eyes of Ukrainians is not an animal that would prompt fear or earn respect and authority from others .
his behavior copies the behavior of a rab@@ bit .
maybe he '@@ s a good economist , but as a prime minister in a war , he does n@@ '@@ t have the right to cry in Parliament , make requests , play with it using his intri@@ gue and threaten to re@@ sign@@ .. he has to lead the country , manage it and protected it during the war .
when putting the country at risk , the prime minister is not entitled to a family , friends , rest or c@@ rying .
after all , he '@@ s the prime minister of Ukraine .
and Y@@ at@@ sen@@ yu@@ k ?
he beha@@ ves like a girl in pub@@ er@@ ty .
yes , he '@@ s tired , but he '@@ s also weak , because he has never been strong , and he does n@@ '@@ t fight for Ukraine , he just compla@@ ins about everything .
therefore , he should leave .
the sooner he does , the better for Ukraine .
why the Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ ans of the gal@@ ax@@ y could n@@ '@@ t save the box office
Sy@@ l@@ vest@@ er Stal@@ lone '@@ s The Ex@@ pend@@ ables 3 has made back less than $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the US , while sin City : a D@@ ame to kill For has made back only $ 12 million of its $ 70 million budget .
the Cameron Di@@ a@@ z vehicle S@@ ex tape took only $ 1@@ 4.@@ 6 million in its opening weekend , while children '@@ s films such as How To Tra@@ in Y@@ our Dra@@ gon 2 are also showing disappointing box office returns .
an article from Tele@@ gra@@ ph film critic Rob@@ bie Col@@ lin indicates that , when it comes to children '@@ s movies , the poor quality of the films themselves might be to blame .
Col@@ lin called 2014 the `` the worst '@@ ' year yet for children '@@ s films , and described How To Tra@@ in Y@@ our Dra@@ gon 2 as a merely `` functional '@@ ' fantasy sequ@@ el .
but when it comes to film pit@@ ched at a slightly older market , it appears that the issue might not necessarily lie with the quality of the films themselves .
in July , entertainment We@@ ek@@ ly compared the average C@@ in@@ em@@ a@@ S@@ core and Met@@ ac@@ ri@@ tic ratings for every summer release playing on at least 2,000 screens between May '@@ s Mem@@ orial Day holiday and July 20 , for 2013 and for this year .
the results , which take the opinion of both cin@@ em@@ a audiences and film critics into account , suggest that this year '@@ s crop of films are of similar cali@@ br@@ e last year '@@ s hits .
some commentators have suggested that changing viewing habits and the increased popularity of web stre@@ aming services such as Net@@ fli@@ x may be to blame .
director J@@ on F@@ av@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on Dis@@ ney '@@ s forthcoming J@@ ung@@ le Bo@@ ok film , told the web@@ site Hollywood repor@@ ter : `` I think times are changing . '@@ '
we have to acknowledge that and not try to ch@@ ase what used to be .
in contrast to Hollywood '@@ s current box office slump , Net@@ fli@@ x recently saw revenue from its stre@@ aming content service reach $ 1.@@ 2@@ bn , almost doubling last year '@@ s figure of $ 8@@ 3@@ 7@@ m .
last summer , director Ste@@ ven Spi@@ el@@ berg critici@@ sed studi@@ os for relying too much on com@@ ic book franch@@ ises , and predicted a Hollywood `` meltdown . '@@ '
in light of the current downturn , some commentators are arguing that his dire prophecy may have held some truth to it .
with summer 2015 set to usher in a s@@ late of potential big box office hits , including A@@ ven@@ gers : age of U@@ l@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons and Ju@@ ra@@ ss@@ ic World , other figures within the film industry are feeling more optimistic .
X-@@ M@@ en producer Sim@@ on Kin@@ berg recently described the drop in box office tak@@ ings as simply `` cyclical , '@@ ' telling Hollywood repor@@ ter : `` N@@ ex@@ t summer will be the biggest bo@@ x@@ -@@ office summer in history , and nobody will be worrying about the business . '@@ '
North Korea threatens Seoul again by firing rocket
North Korea has fired another short-@@ range rocket into the sea , Seoul has announced .
the rocket test reportedly occurred shortly after the end of joint military maneu@@ vers by the United States and South Korea , which Pyongyang views as preparation for an invasion .
the Cha@@ gang province is located in the nor@@ thwest part of the DP@@ R@@ K , along the country '@@ s border with China .
a spokes@@ man for the South Korean Defense Ministry was quoted by the DP@@ A news agency as saying that the rockets had been fired from a location in the nor@@ thwest part of the DP@@ R@@ K and had reached a distance of about 200 k@@ m .
this is apparently the first time North Korea has fired a rocket from the Cha@@ gang province , South Korean media reported , citing military sources .
there is reportedly an underground launching ra@@ mp for S@@ cu@@ d rockets in the province .
this is another of a series of similar tests , which the isolated North Korean regime has carried out in recent weeks .
this year North Korea carried out an unusually high number of rocket and arti@@ l@@ lery tests .
NATO summit : first protests in New@@ port and Car@@ di@@ ff

te@@ ens air@@ lifted from Blu@@ e mountains
two teen@@ age bu@@ sh@@ wal@@ kers have been win@@ ched to safety after spending the night stran@@ ded in the N@@ S@@ W Blu@@ e mountains .
the 16@@ -year-old girl and 18@@ -year-old man went hi@@ king just after mid@@ day on Sunday at G@@ ov@@ et@@ ts Le@@ ap in Black@@ he@@ ath .
concerned relatives called police about 8@@ p@@ m when they had n@@ '@@ t returned home .
a search party involving local police and rescue squ@@ ad was sent out and the pa@@ ir were found about 11@@ p@@ m near brid@@ al veil Fal@@ ls .
the girl had injured her kne@@ e and the man had fallen and hit his head .
officers remained with the pa@@ ir overnight and they were win@@ ched out on M@@ ond@@ ay morning .
they were taken by am@@ bul@@ ance in a stable condition to Blu@@ e mountains Ho@@ sp@@ ital .
O@@ lom@@ ou@@ c took away one point from O@@ pav@@ a , and Va@@ ší@@ ček had the potential winning goal on his foot .
the 2@@ 3-@@ year-old forward was able to decide , but in his two biggest chances he did not succeed .
after the goal , there was mainly a shot from nearby three minutes before the end , but instead of in the net it was caught by O@@ pav@@ a go@@ al@@ keep@@ er Jose@@ f K@@ vě@@ to@@ ň@@ ovi .
`` I had it on my foot , and I have to take advantage of such a chance .
I '@@ m angry at myself , '@@ ' Va@@ ší@@ ček , dumping ash@@ es onto his head .
`` I guess I should have shot higher below top of the net , '@@ ' he said .
S@@ ig@@ ma '@@ s defense did not allow O@@ pav@@ a much , but an exception was Mi@@ ku@@ l '@@ s shot from the 11th minute , which , however , was blocked by go@@ al@@ keep@@ er Ri@@ ech@@ l .
then the Han@@ áci players began putting on pressure , but the defending home players did not give them a chance , and K@@ vě@@ to@@ ň@@ ovi blocked goal attempts from a distance .
we compared for fifteen minutes , and then we took up the initiative .
we were already better in the second half , we had more of the game , and O@@ pav@@ a posed a threat to us only in standard situations .
but Va@@ ší@@ ček did not turn around the failed opportunity , and so it ended 0 : 0 , '@@ ' said Han@@ áků co@@ ach Le@@ o@@ še Kal@@ voda , expressing his disappointment .
O@@ pav@@ a took the point also due to absen@@ ces besides two injured players , Pe@@ tr V@@ av@@ ří@@ k and three-@@ goal shoot@@ er Pe@@ tr Š@@ ev@@ čí@@ kem , hosting in Si@@ le@@ sia from S@@ ig@@ ma , were also missing .
that team did not enable them to play , despite its previous policy .
substitutes deserve closure .
`` S@@ ig@@ ma took more of a so@@ c@@ cer@@ -like approach , but except for one standard we did not let them do anything , '@@ ' com@@ mented the Si@@ le@@ sians ' co@@ ach , Pe@@ tr Bar@@ á@@ nek .
a lot of emphasis , aggres@@ siveness and com@@ ba@@ tiveness could be seen .
`` The draw is probably deserved , because a point for us is a decent gain , '@@ ' he added .
with the draw , S@@ ig@@ ma got to four points , which means thir@@ teenth place .
nothing that could satisfy team head Jose@@ f L@@ é@@ br@@ a , who following defeat in a match with Z@@ no@@ jm@@ o conditioned his investment of a million on diametr@@ ically differ@@ ing performance in subsequent matches .
`` We realized Mr. L@@ é@@ br@@ a '@@ s warning , so there can be no talk about the gu@@ ys not wanting to fight , '@@ ' Kal@@ voda noted , addressing top shoot@@ er Va@@ ší@@ ček , and he added , `` I am confident that the moment will come , and as soon as he shoots a goal , it will start hitting the target .
but after the first successful shot , I will replace him immediately , so that he can shoot goals during other games too , '@@ ' Kal@@ voda said , laugh@@ ing .
Al P@@ ac@@ ino has cap@@ tiv@@ ated Ven@@ ice twice .
otherwise , the film festi@@ val is experiencing a crisis .
following the major enthusiasm about the starting movie `` Bir@@ d@@ man , '@@ ' whose director , A@@ le@@ j@@ an@@ dr@@ o G@@ on@@ zále@@ z I@@ ň@@ ár@@ rit@@ u , was included among the serious candidates for the Golden Li@@ on award , the days that followed gave the impression that interest in the 7@@ 1-@@ year-old festi@@ val in Ven@@ ice had somewhat faded .
whether because the number of seats in the largest theater has increased to 1,@@ 400 or because `` Bir@@ d@@ man '@@ ' was followed by critically ac@@ claimed , but for viewers less attractive , films such as a document@@ ary about the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s , `` view of silence , '@@ ' and other films with social themes , from the American movie `` 99 homes '@@ ' to Iranian `` tal@@ es , '@@ ' seats still remained empty in cin@@ em@@ as .
com@@ ics heroes
even the red car@@ pet in front of the movie palace did not draw as many crowds as in the past , and it reportedly ceased to be a problem to get a hotel room at the last minute .
the crisis is being talked about in Italy more than anywhere else , and it '@@ s no wonder that it has even affected established events such as the Bi@@ en@@ n@@ ale and the oldest film festi@@ val in the world .
fortunately , the crisis does not feature a lack of celebri@@ ties , but they have been present only in connection with movies .
while young fans have crav@@ ed auto@@ gra@@ ph@@ s of com@@ ic sup@@ er hero actors Michael S@@ han@@ non and Andrew Gar@@ field , who played the roles successfully in `` 99 homes , '@@ ' for all generations without any differences the main event was the visit by the legendary actor Al P@@ ac@@ ino .
he even appeared immediately in two movies .
in the story `` epi@@ ph@@ any , '@@ ' scre@@ ened outside of the competition and fil@@ med by Osc@@ ar-@@ winning Bar@@ ry Lev@@ ison according to the novel by Ph@@ illi@@ p Ro@@ th , 7@@ 4-@@ year-old P@@ ac@@ ino has a role that is close to him : a highly celebrated actor who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life .
but seeing him immediately on the second day as the ner@@ dy owner of an iron@@ mon@@ gery from a small rural town in the movie `` M@@ ang@@ le@@ hor@@ n , '@@ ' fil@@ med by David Gordon Green , was truly an un@@ for@@ get@@ table experience .
the Vol@@ pi Cup for the best acting performance is not expected to miss him , but does an artist with P@@ ac@@ ino '@@ s style need prizes ?
maybe admiration from the public is the greatest satisfaction for him , especially Italian admiration , since although he was born in New York , Al P@@ ac@@ ino is proud of the country from which his great grand@@ parents origin@@ ate .
points for Italy
Italian film is generally doing very well in Ven@@ ice .
`` Black Sou@@ ls , '@@ ' directed by Fran@@ ces@@ co Mun@@ zi , became after `` Bir@@ d@@ man '@@ ' the first movie that received a lengthy round of appla@@ use .
a Cal@@ ab@@ re@@ se off@@ shoot of the Ma@@ fia in it is viewed through family relationships between clans , who are fighting with each other over power and money , and the director managed to fulfill all expectations for a good film : good scre@@ en@@ play , camer@@ a sh@@ ots , music and actors .
the psych@@ o thr@@ ill@@ er `` The hungry heart , '@@ ' fil@@ med by Sav@@ eri@@ o Co@@ stan@@ z@@ o with ALBA R@@ oh@@ r@@ w@@ ach@@ er in the role of a woman who through her fits of rage nearly kil@@ ls her own child , also received ac@@ claim .
however , the competing French films did not enjoy such a warm recep@@ tion , neither `` ran@@ so@@ m for glory '@@ ' nor `` 3 hearts , '@@ ' both of which follow the traditional model of movies for consumption , which rely on the popularity of acting personalities .
but in the end , two really excellent films , `` Bir@@ d@@ man '@@ ' and `` Black Sou@@ ls , '@@ ' are not so few for the first half of the festi@@ val .
and while the festi@@ val films have somewhat de@@ pressive themes , the new film by Peter B@@ og@@ dan@@ ov@@ ich entitled `` S@@ he '@@ s fun@@ ny That Way , '@@ ' a hu@@ mo@@ rous com@@ edy shown in Ven@@ ice outside of the competition and fil@@ med in the style of American com@@ edies from the 194@@ 0s , managed to lift everyone '@@ s mood for more than a day .
police in Prague have captured four producers of me@@ th , who were bringing medic@@ ations from Poland .
`` In the past few days , dete@@ c@@ tives arrested three men ages 42 , 42 , and 37 and a woman , 25 , who from last November to this August produced and sold me@@ th in Prague 9 , '@@ ' said police spokes@@ woman Jana R@@ ö@@ ss@@ ler@@ ová .
first on Tu@@ es@@ day , August 12 , the deployment unit on Ci@@ hlá@@ řské Street caught the 4@@ 2-@@ year-old organiz@@ er and deal@@ er and a young woman , who figured in the group as a buyer of medic@@ ations in Poland and a seller of doses .
based on prior permission from the state prosecutor , police then arrested another member of the group the next day , a 3@@ 7-@@ year-old man .
the police caught the last of the four in the morning hours of W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , August 20 , at the site of the M@@ ale@@ š@@ ické inc@@ iner@@ ation plant , '@@ ' the spokes@@ woman said .
the woman received a third of the drugs in exchange for bringing in the medic@@ ations .
the main organiz@@ er was active in many places .
at a work@@ shop in L@@ et@@ ná , in a cot@@ t@@ age in Ho@@ ro@@ mě@@ ř@@ icích , in an apartment on Kon@@ ě@@ v@@ ově Street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced me@@ th , obtained various supplies and chemicals necessary for its production and ensured the transport of drugs containing pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ hed@@ r@@ ine from Poland .
he then weighed the produced drug , placed amounts of it in pla@@ stic sac@@ ks and then sold the me@@ th .
a woman , who has yet to be punished , helped him with the transfer of the medic@@ ations from Poland and with sales to drug users .
`` S@@ he received a third of the produced drugs from the organiz@@ er in exchange for her services , '@@ ' R@@ ö@@ ss@@ ler@@ ová added .
based on a court order , law enforcement officials also conducted several home search@@ es , where they found drugs , industrial chemicals , digital sc@@ ales , pla@@ stic sac@@ ks , injec@@ tion syr@@ ing@@ es , ho@@ ses and other supplies and items , which according to experts can be considered a complete set of supplies for meth@@ amp@@ h@@ et@@ am@@ ine production .
the deal@@ er had already been punished seven times since 1995 .
`` F@@ rom the available evidence , the police discovered that the main organiz@@ er had been convicted in court of property crimes a total of seven times since 1995 , and the woman had never been convicted , '@@ ' the police spo@@ ke@@ sper@@ son added .
the last man arrested was condi@@ tionally sentenced in 2006 for sexual assault , and a 3@@ 7-@@ year-old auto mechan@@ ic , who is not being held in cust@@ ody during prosecution , has received nine court convictions since 2009 .
he was mostly sentenced for property crimes .
the investig@@ ator has charged three men and a woman with prohibited production and other handling of nar@@ co@@ tic and psych@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic substan@@ ces and pois@@ ons , for which they could face up to 10 years in prison .
`` For three persons , the investig@@ ator eventually filed a request with the state prosecutor asking that they be re@@ man@@ ded into cust@@ ody , and a judge eventually honored the request and placed them there , '@@ ' said the spo@@ ke@@ sper@@ son .
the fourth accused , a 3@@ 7-@@ year-old reci@@ divi@@ st , remains free .
his position and role in the activity was not as significant as the other accused .
police are continuing to work with that man .

cancel@@ ing high schools and secondary schools does n@@ '@@ t make sense .
the Czech Republic does not have enough generally education people , and moreover statistics show that high school students have good prospects .
the beginning of the school year is here .
major preparations have been carried out in schools in the past four@@ teen days .
most of this has been routine preparation , such as bringing flow@@ ers from their summer storage areas back to the class@@ rooms and preparing ch@@ al@@ k .
at Ho@@ ř@@ ický High School , there will be a bit more to do .
a couple of days before the start of the season , they are looking for fur@@ nit@@ ure , computers and other technical equipment as well as literature for the library .
this is neither the result of bur@@ gl@@ ary or em@@ bez@@ z@@ le@@ ment . after three years , Ho@@ ř@@ ický High School is re@@ opening and resum@@ ing its activities .
not on a public , but on a private platform .
the shortage of material fur@@ ni@@ sh@@ ings is not because the founders were incompetent .
they had to expect that the school '@@ s existence would be confirmed by its entry into the register of schools administered by the Czech Ministry of Education , You@@ th and S@@ ports .
France '@@ s Socialists should ` shut up and sort France out ' , Fran@@ co@@ is Hollande '@@ s key ally says
Mr Val@@ ls called on the deeply divided Left to `` show its affec@@ tion '@@ ' for the emb@@ att@@ led Socialist president , whose re@@ shuff@@ le has failed to meet the approval of the vast majority of French .
the president deserves everyone '@@ s respect , he deserves our loy@@ ality , he deserves our support .
`` It is our duty to remain at his sides , '@@ ' he said , to appla@@ use .
as a pla@@ cat@@ ory gesture , the prime minister insisted his government would not call into question France '@@ s controversial 3@@ 5-@@ hour working week , despite infla@@ m@@ mat@@ ory suggestions it should relax the rules earlier in the week by Em@@ manuel Mac@@ ron , the new economy minister .
on Satur@@ day , Mr Hollande had implo@@ red his fellow Socialists to remain `` united '@@ ' with the government .
but Christi@@ ane T@@ au@@ bir@@ a , the justice minister , put a span@@ ner in the works by turning up to a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs and critici@@ sing the Socialist Party for letting the French `` lose faith in their future . '@@ '
marine Le Pen , the far-right National Front leader , he@@ ap@@ ed scor@@ n on the Socialists ' constant in-@@ fighting by saying she did not see the new Val@@ ls government lasting more than just a few months .
Fran@@ co@@ is Hollande the Emp@@ er@@ or has no clothes , but neither has Prince Manuel Val@@ ls , forced to put together a new government when the previous one did n@@ '@@ t even survive the summer .
`` And the new one wo n@@ '@@ t survive the fall or the winter either , '@@ ' M@@ iss Le Pen told supporters .
she reiter@@ ated her party '@@ s call for a parliamentary dissol@@ ution , saying she was confident it could win early elections and stood ready to govern .
France '@@ s ruling party suffered a dru@@ b@@ bing in March municipal elections and the far-right National Front came out on top in EU elections in May .
a poll in Sunday '@@ s Journal du Dim@@ anch@@ e found 76 per cent of French believe the Socialist Party risks breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Mr Hollande '@@ s presidential term in 20@@ 17 .
Pas@@ cal Per@@ r@@ ine@@ au , a political scientist at Sciences Po university , warned the French would fast lose patience unless the new Socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record unemployment .
`` It has a small window of opportunity , but public opinion needs to quickly feel things are changing , '@@ ' he warned .
otherwise , the situation could further de@@ generate .
Prague wo n@@ '@@ t restrict gambling , bu@@ sk@@ ing before elections
amendments to relevant regulations are not expected to be prepared and approved until after the capital city '@@ s new leaders take their positions .
additional gambling hal@@ ls will not disappear from Prague '@@ s streets before the municipal elections , and the city will not restrict street art .
even walking dogs will not be restricted .
Prague will not manage by the October elections to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant regulations in the City Assembly .
`` furthermore , the decisions about changes are not expected to be made by the city '@@ s current leaders , whose mandate ends in a few weeks , '@@ ' said council member Lu@@ ká@@ š Man@@ har@@ t -LRB- top 0@@ 9 -RRB- .
several local town hal@@ ls have decided to ban gambling facilities on their territory immediately in recent weeks , such as Prague 5 and 7 .
however , the gambling hal@@ ls are not going away , and the regulations will not be changed for now .
that task will be up to the city '@@ s new leaders after the elections .
`` Right now we would not even technically be able to manage it in time , because of , for example , the dead@@ lines for sub@@ mitting feedback , etc . '@@ ' Man@@ har@@ t explained .
he pointed out that the last session of the current City Council , which must approve the change , will take place on September 11 .
a referendum on a total ban on gambling hal@@ ls will take place on the day of the municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8 .
there is currently a ban on gambling hal@@ ls in locations such as Prague 2 and Prague 12 .
for the same reasons , the regulation will not be changed even for street art , known as bu@@ sk@@ ing .
that activity has been complained about mainly by Prague 1 , which has already sent City H@@ all a proposed list of locations which it would like to add to the locations where it is already banned .
Prague 5 does not want mus@@ icians near An@@ dě@@ la either .
a directive that would regulate dog walking has been planned by the city for several months , but its preparation is not yet finished .
locations of gambling hal@@ ls and the issue of bu@@ sk@@ ing are being resolved by municipal decre@@ es .
they can be issued and amended only by the Prague City Council .
the town hal@@ ls have only an advisory say , and they themselves can not issue decre@@ es .
last week , supporters of Scottish independence were in reach of a victory .
the campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making the same mistake three times , when it almost placed bill@@ boards all over Scotland asking if Sc@@ ots wanted to be rich .
however , you will not win over the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wal@@ lets , and you will not even gain their respect when you start threatening them .
the morals in the New T@@ est@@ ament are still very relevant in Scotland , even though only a small number of Sc@@ ots still go to church .
Sc@@ ots have a much greater tendency to push money chan@@ gers out of their houses of wor@@ ship rather than allowing others to dictate to them how they should vote .
the Scottish nationalists ' leader , A@@ lex Sal@@ mon@@ d , knows this very well , and therefore in the television discussion he repeatedly asked his rival , uni@@ onist Dar@@ ling , whether he would be willing to respect `` the sovereign will of the Scottish people , '@@ ' if Scottish voters chose independence , and whether he would begin supporting a single currency for Scotland as well as for England .
this forced Dar@@ ling to choose between Scottish civil society and London bankers , and this situation made him gri@@ ma@@ ce .
of course , Dar@@ ling will not support the mandate of Scottish voters .
although this discussion about what currency Scotland would have has been more or less neutr@@ alized .
what really motiv@@ ates Scottish voters are fairness , job opportunities and protection of the state health care system , which citizens enjoy free of charge .
regarding the issue of the currency , Dar@@ ling has supported London bankers and has also created the impression that he will not protest against privatization of health care .
in doing so , Sal@@ mon@@ d said , `` G@@ et in bed with Conservatives . '@@ '
that is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician .
every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with Conservatives .
this has been confirmed by David Cameron , who spoke in Scotland not to voters , but to an association of `` bosses , '@@ ' the Con@@ federation of British Indu@@ stry .
it is becoming clear that Cameron '@@ s refusal to debate about independence with Scottish Prime Minister Sal@@ mon@@ d was a major mistake for the uni@@ onist campaign .
it makes Cameron look like a co@@ war@@ dly absen@@ tee at home .
the Sc@@ ots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish prime minister .
Cameron at least managed to say that Scotland could be `` a successful independent country . '@@ '
Ali@@ sta@@ ir Dar@@ ling can not manage to say anything like that , and it almost causes him physical pain .
what he is sharing is clear : Sc@@ ots should n@@ '@@ t jump up and down and must accept things as they are .

she let her un@@ born daughters die .
she may face an exceptional sentence - Nov@@ in@@ ky@@ .@@ c@@ z
the first birth occurred in March 2012 in a public re@@ stro@@ om stall at the bus station in Ji@@ hlava .
without anyone else '@@ s help , she gave birth to a small girl , and after cutting off her um@@ bili@@ cal cord she placed the baby in a prepared blanket , hid the child under her jack@@ et and took her to a side road , where she left her in the bu@@ shes just a few dozen meters from the road@@ way .
she gave birth on the way to school .
it happened a little early .
`` I was on the way to school .
in the bus , I felt like I needed to go to the re@@ stro@@ om , and that '@@ s where I gave birth .
she was born live and looked at me .
I cut off the um@@ bili@@ cal cord with sci@@ ss@@ ors , which I was carrying to school , '@@ ' the accused said , adding that she was ash@@ amed to be pregnant .
`` On the next day , she returned to the location , placed the child '@@ s body in a back@@ pack and carried it away , then removed the body from the back@@ pack , w@@ rap@@ ped it in a black pla@@ stic bag and hid it under the sta@@ ir@@ way at her grand@@ mother '@@ s home in Hav@@ lí@@ č@@ k@@ obrod@@ sku '@@ ' the law@@ suit read@@ s , adding that it is not entirely clear when the new@@ born '@@ s death occurred .
it could have been within fifteen minutes to half an hour , but even several hours after birth , through suffoc@@ ation by the blanket or during pla@@ cement beneath the jack@@ et , freez@@ ing to death or ble@@ eding from the un@@ band@@ aged ab@@ dom@@ en .
a similar incident occurred next year in the spring .
the woman at an unclear time between February and April 12 , when the child '@@ s body was found by pas@@ ser@@ s@@ by below the bu@@ shes near a pon@@ d in Hav@@ lí@@ č@@ k@@ obrod@@ sku , again gave birth by herself in secret .
this time in the ba@@ th@@ room of an at@@ tic apartment in a family house .
even without chec@@ king whether the child had been born alive and even without cutting the um@@ bili@@ cal cord , which was stretched around the ne@@ ck , she placed the child into several pieces of pla@@ stic w@@ rap@@ ping , including a pla@@ stic bag , and left her in the ba@@ th@@ room .
then in the after@@ no@@ on hours , she and her partner at the time took the child to a pon@@ d .
the boy@@ friend eventually turned her in
both children '@@ s father was the defen@@ dant '@@ s boy@@ friend , who , however , reportedly did n@@ '@@ t know about his partner '@@ s pregnancy .
that '@@ s another reason why he '@@ s not currently facing court proceedings , because he was punished for a mis@@ de@@ mean@@ or violation legislation governing fun@@ er@@ als .
he was also the one who later cont@@ acted police .
I do n@@ '@@ t like that he is not being punished as an accompli@@ ce .
he manipulated with the child against my wishes .
I know that my solution was not right , but at the time it seemed humane to me , '@@ ' the accused , who allegedly submitted to the man in the relationship and was afraid of him , said , not hiding her anger .
during her testimony , the young woman spoke relatively cal@@ m@@ ly .
she did n@@ '@@ t begin c@@ rying until she started talking about her relationship with her parents , from whom she had left after reaching adul@@ thood .
she said she did n@@ '@@ t want to kill .
`` They have been visiting me every 14 days , and they are doing everything they can for me , even though I know that I do n@@ '@@ t deserve it , '@@ ' she said .
`` I did n@@ '@@ t get baby clothes , because I did n@@ '@@ t want children , I thought I was too young .
I kept wanting to put the child in a baby box , but I do n@@ '@@ t know what happened or why I did n@@ '@@ t do that .
that '@@ s something I ca n@@ '@@ t explain to you , '@@ ' she said in response to the judge .
however , she denied that she had acted with the intention to kill the new@@ born .
she said furthermore that the second child had been born dead .
she had not stopped drinking alcohol even during pregnancy .
`` But I limited it .
and I did n@@ '@@ t drink hard liqu@@ or .
and I limited smoking too , '@@ ' she said .
although her pregnancy was visible in both cases , she always claimed repeatedly in response to questions that she had health problems and was retaining water .
she even told this to her boy@@ friend .
the main hearing will continue at the court in H@@ ra@@ dec on Tu@@ es@@ day with testimony from court experts .
the verdict could be handed down as early as W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day .
the woman could face up to 18 years in prison or even an exceptional punishment .

Hong Kong pro-democracy activists hec@@ kle China official day after vote ruling
a group of Beijing loyalists stood nearby wav@@ ing China '@@ s flag .
the NP@@ C Stan@@ ding Committee on Sunday endorsed a framework to let only two or three candidates run in Hong Kong '@@ s 20@@ 17 leadership vote .
all candidates must first obtain majority backing from a nomin@@ ating committee likely to be st@@ ac@@ ked with Beijing loyalists .
the decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot prompted pro-democracy activists to renew their vo@@ w to bring Hong Kong '@@ s financial hu@@ b to a halt with `` occupy Central '@@ ' protests .
political reform has been a major source of tension in Hong Kong , with China party leaders fearful of calls for democracy spreading to other cities .
following the publication by Beijing of a white paper out@@ lining China '@@ s authority over Hong Kong in June , democracy activists held an uno@@ ff@@ ici@@ al referendum on voting in the special administrative region , and hundreds of thousands mar@@ ched to the city '@@ s business district and staged a s@@ it-@@ in .

Putin demands Kiev open ` statehood ' talks with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease batt@@ ling separatists in the country '@@ s east and immediately begin negotiations on the breakaway region '@@ s `` statehood , '@@ ' according to Russian news accounts of his remarks .
his spokes@@ man , Dmitry Pe@@ sk@@ ov , later clari@@ fied that Putin did n@@ '@@ t mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia , but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian-@@ speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests .
but Putin '@@ s call upon the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro@@ -Russia insurgents as equals cor@@ responded with the apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five months ago : help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Nov@@ oro@@ ssi@@ ya region virtual independence to align with Russia instead of the West .
in an interview with state-@@ run Chan@@ nel One television , Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to recover separati@@ st-@@ held territory in the eastern Don@@ et@@ sk and Lu@@ han@@ sk regions that were seized in March and April , after Moscow an@@ ne@@ xed Ukraine '@@ s Cri@@ mean peninsula on March 18 .
the Kremlin and the separatists have lately bran@@ ded the seized territory `` Nov@@ oro@@ ssi@@ ya , '@@ ' or `` New Russia , '@@ ' a term that har@@ k@@ ens to pre-@@ revolutionary glory days of the Russian empire .
Putin said that anyone who believed peace talks are in the off@@ ing as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns for an Oct@@ . 26 parliamentary election and while government troops are attacking civilian communities in separati@@ st-@@ held regions is `` a prisoner to illusions , '@@ ' I@@ tar@@ -@@ T@@ ass reported .
`` We must immediately comm@@ ence substantive talks and not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the statehood status of sou@@ theast Ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there , '@@ ' he said .
Pe@@ sk@@ ov said Putin '@@ s reference to statehood was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership as it struggles to al@@ lay fears in the Russian-@@ speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger .
only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy , Pe@@ sk@@ ov said .
it '@@ s not a matter to be negotiated between Ukraine and Russia , Pe@@ sk@@ ov said , `` because it '@@ s not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal Ukrainian conflict . '@@ '
the Kremlin spokes@@ man '@@ s inter@@ cession to correct the `` mis@@ interpretation '@@ ' of Putin '@@ s remarks underscored the Russian leadership '@@ s approach to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east differently from its outright seiz@@ ure of Crimea , where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian .
Moscow would have a much more difficult fight to an@@ ne@@ x even the Don@@ et@@ sk and Lu@@ han@@ sk regions of eastern Ukraine , as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian and pre-@@ conflict polls showed broad support for staying within Ukraine .
the autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international for@@ ums would grant regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations , effectively handing the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea .
the Black Sea peninsula an@@ ne@@ xed five months ago is home to Russia '@@ s main naval fleet as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic coastal re@@ sorts .
the regions between Russia '@@ s R@@ ost@@ ov area and Crimea are also home to mines , factories and foun@@ dri@@ es that produce vital components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian President Pe@@ tr@@ o Po@@ ro@@ shenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections -- weigh constitutional amendments to give more control to the disparate regions over their finances and the status of languages .
but his vision of autonomy appears to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels Moscow is accused of arming and instig@@ ating .
Putin '@@ s latest call on Kiev to deal with the separatist leaders as equals followed new advances by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of A@@ z@@ ov .
the Russian-@@ backed separatists took control of the town of Nov@@ o@@ az@@ ov@@ sk in a drive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the opening of a campaign to seize the strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea .
that has spurred a massive civilian and military effort to for@@ tify Mari@@ upo@@ l , a ste@@ el@@ making port of 5@@ 00,000 that lies between Nov@@ o@@ az@@ ov@@ sk and the narrow g@@ ate@@ way into the Cri@@ mean peninsula .
Po@@ ro@@ shenko on Satur@@ day addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to urge action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
`` We are close to the point of no return , '@@ ' Po@@ ro@@ shenko warned .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
the EU summit took no definitive action ; the leaders called for drafting more punishing sanctions on Russia to be imposed in the event of an un@@ specified escalation of the Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in I@@ lov@@ ay@@ sk after two colum@@ ns of Russian arm@@ or and 1,000 troops last week moved into the Don@@ et@@ sk region to bolster the be@@ le@@ agu@@ ered separatists , Col@@ . An@@ dri@@ y Ly@@ sen@@ ko , spokes@@ man for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council , told reporters in Kiev on Satur@@ day .
the first of a reported 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped in I@@ lov@@ ay@@ sk by the Russian incur@@ sion were swap@@ ped Sunday for 10 Russian par@@ atro@@ op@@ ers captured inside Ukrainian territory a week ago , Ly@@ sen@@ ko said Sunday .

if we had played that way from the start of the season , then I am convinced that we would n@@ '@@ t have lost , '@@ ' L@@ é@@ br@@ a said .
in O@@ pav@@ a , S@@ ig@@ ma put a stop to the initial pressure from the home team , and then it balanced the game , and in the second half it was already better .
following victory , Kal@@ voda '@@ s ent@@ ru@@ sted players exer@@ ted efforts , but they did not achieve any goals , and so they could n@@ '@@ t win .
`` The result is not what we expected .
but for complete satisfaction , we were missing only one transformed opportunity , '@@ ' said L@@ é@@ br@@ a , who believes , however , that the change in the players ' approach was caused only by his threat .
`` There were certainly multiple aspects .
both from my side and from the side of the co@@ ach or fans , '@@ ' L@@ é@@ br@@ a said .
S@@ ig@@ ma has to anticipate pressure .
after the game in O@@ pav@@ a , the players did not want to comment much regarding the events from last week .
`` I '@@ m trying to put these things completely behind me .
I have tried not to concede the situation , '@@ ' young go@@ al@@ keep@@ er Mich@@ al Re@@ ich@@ l said , shaking his head .
L@@ é@@ br@@ a '@@ s statement from last week was left entirely without comment by offensive player Václav Va@@ ší@@ ček , who did not fulfill S@@ ig@@ ma '@@ s biggest opportunity in the Satur@@ day game .
however , he eventually spoke about it just a little .
`` We '@@ ll always be under pressure .
everyone wants to te@@ ar us apart .
today we demonstrated that if we fight and kick everyone '@@ s ass , then it works , '@@ ' he said .
they took the warning to heart .
even co@@ ach Le@@ o@@ š Kal@@ voda did not hesitate to say that the preparation for the game were not the easiest , given the atmosphere that was present in O@@ lom@@ ou@@ c last week .
it was very difficult .
but I think that the boys realized that , and today it was clear that they had taken Mr. L@@ é@@ br@@ a '@@ s warning to heart .
this is true although even previously they did not want to fight and they sla@@ cked off , '@@ ' the O@@ lom@@ ou@@ c co@@ ach said .
`` It was similar to today in the first fifteen minutes .
it lasted until we came to terms with the tough@@ ness and realized what a second league is all about .
that it '@@ s not about soccer , but mainly about fighting , '@@ ' Kal@@ voda said .
all that is left to do is hope that in the next games things will work for S@@ ig@@ ma from the beginning .
`` I would really like to believe that , '@@ ' he added .
