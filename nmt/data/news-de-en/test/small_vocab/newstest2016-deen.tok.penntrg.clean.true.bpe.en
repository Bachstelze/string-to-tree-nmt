Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teheran &apos;s destabili@@ sing activities in the Middle East .
the meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disputed two state solution .
relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been strained for years .
Washington critici@@ ses the continuous building of settlements in Israel and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
the relationship between the two has further deteriorated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran &apos;s atomic programme , .
in March , at the invitation of the Republicans , Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time impending in Israel .
in 9@@ 11 C@@ all , Professor admits to shooting G@@ ir@@ l@@ friend
in a 9@@ 11 call , his voice only slightly shaky , college professor Sh@@ ann@@ on lam@@ b told police he had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and officers needed to get over to their house .
lam@@ b made a point to say his `` swe@@ et dog &apos;&apos; was there alive and probably upset , and said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on her phone .
inside the home , officers found Am@@ y P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss &apos; body and a hand-@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white legal pa@@ d : `` I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Am@@ y and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &apos;&apos; read the letter authorities say was signed by lam@@ b .
there was no indication that lam@@ b , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in C@@ le@@ vel@@ and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , had already traveled 300 miles to the school &apos;s campus , where police believe he shot and killed a well-@@ liked history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , in the door@@ way to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a@@ .@@ m .
he said lam@@ b made the fateful 9@@ 11 call sometime after that .
by the end of the day , there would be one more death : lam@@ b took his own life as police closed in on him .
a day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated lam@@ b .
the details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
students said they looked forward to his class .
police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmidt himself had included lam@@ b in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the `` wonderful people &apos;&apos; he shared his academic life with .
both taught in the Di@@ vision of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 faculty members , and many students took courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations of problems .
a student who praised lam@@ b , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , said he also seemed ag@@ itated and j@@ it@@ tery , `` like there was something wrong with him . &apos;&apos;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said lam@@ b told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 201@@ 4-@@ 15 academic year .
lam@@ b had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
this year , he was only teaching two online classes .
recent changes in the university &apos;s hiring policies meant that the doc@@ torate lam@@ b had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assi@@ stant professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did n&apos;t know of any conflict between lam@@ b and Schmidt but `` obviously there was something in Mr. lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &apos;&apos;
those are questions lam@@ b can no longer answer .
after fleeing the campus , police later picked up lam@@ b &apos;s tra@@ il when he crossed back into Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be ap@@ preh@@ ended , lam@@ b killed himself with a single .@@ 3@@ 8-@@ cali@@ ber pi@@ sto@@ l in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of Gre@@ envi@@ lle , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , said Washington Coun@@ ty cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to that home , though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lam@@ b grew up in the area .
lam@@ b started working at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 , in 2009 and taught geography and education classes .
he received a doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
one of lam@@ b &apos;s longtime friends described him as smart , charismatic and fun@@ ny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play gu@@ it@@ ar .
he was quite the heart@@ thro@@ b back then .
all the girls would melt when he was around , &apos;&apos; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
lam@@ b and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss had apparently been dating for some time .
in the 9@@ 11 call , lam@@ b said `` I killed my wife , &apos;&apos; but there was no record of them ever mar@@ rying .
they had a dog named ligh@@ tn@@ ing that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
police said the dog was OK .
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss &apos; ex-@@ husband , Sha@@ wn O&apos;@@ St@@ een , said they divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who &apos;s now 19 .
`` S@@ he was completely devastated , &apos;&apos; O&apos;@@ St@@ een said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O&apos;@@ St@@ een said he had not met lam@@ b but heard through his daughter A@@ bi@@ g@@ ail that lam@@ b was interested in music and played the blu@@ es .
lam@@ b met P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss when he and A@@ bi@@ g@@ ail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
later , they played together in the occasional gi@@ g .
O&apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sh@@ aff@@ er , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Ro@@ om , a di@@ m@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he last saw lam@@ b and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss the night of S@@ ept . 5 , after lam@@ b had finished playing his gu@@ it@@ ar and harmon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crowd .
there was no sign of anything a@@ miss .
`` Just a happy couple , &apos;&apos; he said .
we were cutting up and throwing one-@@ liners at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of wi@@ t about them .
Schmidt , the sla@@ in professor , directed the first-@@ year semin@@ ar program and specialized in N@@ ative American and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three young children .
he studied at Em@@ por@@ ia State University in Kansas and was president of his frat@@ ernity and student government .
on the Delta State campus in C@@ le@@ vel@@ and on Tu@@ es@@ day night , about 900 people , including faculty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a cand@@ le@@ light mem@@ orial .
Schmidt &apos;s wife , Li@@ z , and brother J@@ eff Schmidt also attended the vigi@@ l , during which the university cho@@ ir s@@ ang `` B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &apos;&apos; and `` amazing grace . &apos;&apos;
classes resume W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
`` We &apos;re trying to get our students to come back , &apos;&apos; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Am@@ y and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from C@@ le@@ vel@@ and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i .
associated Press writers Emi@@ ly Wag@@ ster Pet@@ tus in Gre@@ envi@@ lle , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , and Re@@ be@@ cc@@ a Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying lam@@ b made the 9@@ 11 call after shooting Schmidt , and that while lam@@ b referred to P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss as his wife in the 9@@ 11 call , there is no indication the two ever married .

UN Chief says There Is No Military Sol@@ ution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia &apos;s stepped up military support for Syria is that `` there is no military solution &apos;&apos; to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the U.@@ N@@ . chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.@@ N@@ . Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly &apos;s ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers `` made this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &apos;&apos;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Pol@@ l N@@ um@@ bers That S@@ how Donald trump Is For Real
some have tried to label him a fli@@ p@@ -@@ fl@@ op@@ per .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are holding out for an implosion .
but no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald trump down from atop the polls , it has n&apos;t worked -LRB- yet -RRB- .
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald trump &apos;s lead at double dig@@ its , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l &apos;s nomination chances .
of course , it &apos;s still early in the election cycle .
none of this is to say that trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
pundits point out that at this time in 2011 , R@@ ick Perry &apos;s lead was giving way to a rising Herman C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Sup@@ er PA@@ C and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing trump &apos;s staying power and beginning to un@@ load their dollars to topple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is n&apos;t just a passing phase :
trump &apos;s favor@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
right before Donald trump announced his candidacy in mid-@@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid-@@ July , it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald trump .
roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac poll in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of trump .
two-thirds of G@@ O@@ P voters would be happy with trump as the nominee .
in a CNN @/@ OR@@ C poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either `` enthusiastic &apos;&apos; or `` satisfied &apos;&apos; if trump were the nominee .
only two in 10 say they would be `` upset &apos;&apos; if he were the nominee .
only Ben Car@@ son generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as trump -LRB- 43 percent say they would be `` enthusiastic &apos;&apos; v@@ s. 40 percent who say the same of trump -RRB- .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
Mar@@ co Ru@@ bi@@ o with only 21 percent .
on the fli@@ p side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be `` dissatis@@ fied &apos;&apos; or `` upset &apos;&apos; if establishment favorite Je@@ b Bush becomes the nominee .
a majority of Republicans do n&apos;t see trump &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald trump has been widely criticized for his bomb@@ ast and insults , 52 percent of le@@ aned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament to be president , according to Mon@@ day &apos;s A@@ BC News @/@ Washington Post poll .
the same number holds in the first-@@ in-@@ the-@@ nation cau@@ cus state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
still , 44 percent think he does n&apos;t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 indepen@@ dents say his temper@@ ament does not belong in the White House , according to A@@ BC @/@ Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their pundi@@ t hat@@ s , Republican voters think trump is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the G@@ O@@ P nomination , four in 10 said trump was the best bet , according to a CNN @/@ OR@@ C poll out last week .
that &apos;s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Je@@ b Bush in late July .
full disclosure : G@@ O@@ P voters have n&apos;t had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycle , four in 10 Republicans picked R@@ ick Perry to win the nomination , v@@ s. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney .
still , it shows that a plur@@ ality of G@@ O@@ P voters see trump &apos;s campaign as plausible .
even if Republicans rallied around another candidate , trump still be@@ ats almost everyone .
some pundits point out that the sp@@ l@@ inter@@ ed field is likely contributing to trump &apos;s lead , while anti-@@ Tru@@ mp support is be spread diff@@ us@@ ely among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a Mon@@ mouth University poll in early September shows that , in a hypothetical head@@ -to-@@ head mat@@ ch@@ up between trump and most other Republican candidates , trump almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
he leads C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina by 13 points , Mar@@ co Ru@@ bi@@ o by 14 points , Wal@@ ker by 15 points , Je@@ b Bush by 19 points , and , finally , Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e by 33 points each .
he &apos;s in a dead heat with T@@ ed C@@ ru@@ z .
the only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head@@ -to-@@ head .
a bare majority of Donald trump &apos;s supporters say they &apos;ve made up their minds .
a new CB@@ S @/@ N@@ Y@@ T poll out on Tu@@ es@@ day shows that just more than half of voters who support trump say they have locked in their votes .
obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to swit@@ ching candidates .
still , trump &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for trump .
six in 10 Republicans say they agree with trump on immigration .
even since Donald trump called immigrants from Mexico `` rapi@@ sts &apos;&apos; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation .
some are worried that trump &apos;s bomb@@ ast will drive crucial Hispan@@ ic voters away from the Republican Party and damage re@@ br@@ anding efforts .
but according to Mon@@ day &apos;s new A@@ BC @/@ Post poll , six in 10 Republicans say they agree with trump on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems Donald trump will remain too .
frustration with government is clim@@ bing to new highs .
Donald trump and Ben Car@@ son now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their outsider status .
six in 10 Republicans in Mon@@ day &apos;s new A@@ BC @/@ Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington , too .
a D@@ es Mo@@ ines register @/@ Bloomberg poll in I@@ owa from two weeks ago shows that three in four I@@ owa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent `` uns@@ atis@@ fied &apos;&apos; and 21 percent `` mad as hell . &apos;&apos;
Munich , Sy@@ lt und C@@ o . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive residential developments are located here in H@@ ob@@ o@@ ok@@ en@@ weg - with a view over the North Sea mu@@ d@@ fl@@ ats .

`` On Sy@@ lt , the number of properties on offer is naturally limited , &apos;&apos; says a study - hence the high prices .
this new study indicates the particular locations with the most expensive accommodation per square met@@ re .
of course , € 18@@ .@@ 70 per square met@@ re for student di@@ gs in Munich is not really low .

more than € 10,000 is nothing there - per qu@@ are met@@ re , mind you .

inci@@ dentally , for once Munich is not in the lead .
champions League : Bay@@ ern off to a dream start thanks to Müll@@ er and G@@ ö@@ tze
double goal scor@@ er in Pi@@ raeus : Bay@@ ern star Thomas Müll@@ er is simply on a roll .
a lucky goal from Thomas Müll@@ er paved the way for a 3 : 0 victory for F@@ C Bay@@ ern at Ol@@ ypi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it got better .
a confident start to the Champi@@ ons League season .
world champions Thomas Müll@@ er and Mario G@@ ö@@ tze brought about a dream start to their `` Milan Mission &apos;&apos; in the se@@ e@@ thing cau@@ l@@ dr@@ on at Pi@@ re@@ aus .
tra@@ iner pe@@ p Gu@@ ardi@@ ola &apos;s team won their opening match in the Champi@@ ons League in a hot atmosphere away to the Greek record holders , thanks to Müll@@ er &apos;s bra@@ ce -LRB- 5@@ 2@@ nd and 90@@ th minutes +@@ 2 -RRB- and G@@ ö@@ tze &apos;s goal -LRB- 8@@ 9@@ th minute -RRB- , ending in a score of 3 : 0 -LRB- 0 : 0 -RRB- .
the twel@@ f@@ th successful start in a row should be the first step toward the final in Italy on 28 May 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to end his third attempt by taking the tro@@ ph@@ y back to Munich .
with his 2@@ 8@@ th goal in the Champi@@ ons League , Müll@@ er took Bay@@ ern into the lead with the gra@@ cious help of Ol@@ y@@ mi@@ ac@@ os go@@ alie Ro@@ berto , who let through a cross shot from the world champion .
`` We are n&apos;t going to underestimate them , &apos;&apos; promised Bay@@ ern captain Ph@@ illi@@ p@@ p Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ kak@@ is Stadium in front of 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot@@ -@@ blo@@ o@@ ded fans - and the Munich player kept his word .
they demonstrated a concentrated and committed performance without being show@@ y .
Pi@@ raeus had won their six most recent pre@@ mi@@ ere class home games , including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ le@@ ti@@ co Madrid and Ju@@ vent@@ us Tur@@ in .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mund st@@ umb@@ led here too .
but Bay@@ ern , un@@ defeated in seven Europa Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went to work boldly , but often too un@@ inspired in their offensive efforts .
attacks were too often initiated by bringing left w@@ inger Dou@@ glas Costa , who rarely got past former Br@@ uns@@ wi@@ ck player Omar E@@ lab@@ del@@ la@@ ou@@ i , into play .
Müll@@ er had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field drove into the top left corner of the goal .
in the 6@@ 7@@ th minute the world champion missed the chance of taking the match to 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best opportunities in the first half .
first when Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Pol@@ e &apos;s he@@ ader from the line in the 2@@ 6@@ th minute .
then with a shot which the go@@ alie par@@ ried with his kne@@ e in the 3@@ 5@@ th minute .
although Bay@@ ern is used to playing a dominant game , Pi@@ raeus were able to need@@ le them .
but they could count on go@@ al@@ ke@@ ep@@ er Manuel Neu@@ er .
for example when he ste@@ ered a shot from Ide@@ ye over the cross@@ bar in the 5@@ 6@@ th minute .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a four-@@ man back@@ field def@@ ence deployed in front of Neu@@ er , with David Alb@@ a in the centr@@ e next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng .
Mario G@@ ö@@ tze , back in the squ@@ ad following muscle problems , initially sat on the sidelines .
the world c@@ up hero had only been given the green light following final training , said spor@@ ting Director Mat@@ thi@@ as Sam@@ mer on Sk@@ y : `` If anyone wants to make something else out of that , they are being mal@@ ici@@ ous . &apos;&apos;
at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him , when he brought in K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the stri@@ cken Le@@ wand@@ owski in the 5@@ 9@@ th minute .
G@@ ö@@ tze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal in the 7@@ 6@@ th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later ; Müll@@ er put another one in with a penalty .
before the match there was a ri@@ ot in the stadium .
after a small group of Bay@@ ern fans , some wearing mas@@ ks , had apparently provoked supporters of hosts Pi@@ raeus from behind their fence with words and gestures , security forces attacked them and used bat@@ ons against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bay@@ ern fan was taken injured from the stadium .
smokers at a greater risk of losing teeth
smokers damage not only their lung@@ s but also their teeth , concludes a long-term study in Pot@@ s@@ dam .
the good news is : if you give up the risk decreases fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this emerges from a long-term study by an international team of researchers , including a number of employees of the German Institute for nutritional Research -LRB- D@@ If@@ E -RRB- in Pot@@ s@@ dam .
compared to non-@@ smokers , the risk of losing their teeth prematurely is between 2.5 and 3.6 times higher for smokers .
the scientists monitored more than 2@@ 3,@@ 300 participants .
the main reasons for to@@ oth loss are c@@ aries and infl@@ amm@@ ation of the g@@ ums , the D@@ If@@ E states .
smoking is a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphasi@@ se the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more frequent g@@ um infl@@ amm@@ ation in smokers .
it has not been clari@@ fied to what extent smoking raises the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the `` Journal of D@@ ental Research . &apos;&apos;
it could however take 10 years before the danger once more drops to the level of non-@@ smokers &apos; , declared lead author Thomas Di@@ et@@ rich of the University of Bir@@ min@@ gh@@ am in England .
people should be persuaded to become non-@@ smokers , declared study leader H@@ einer Boeing of D@@ If@@ E : `` smoking shor@@ tens the li@@ fes@@ pan . &apos;&apos;
not smoking is good for the lung@@ s and vessels and in our experience leads to good dental health to an advanced age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by to@@ oth@@ lessness , according to the D@@ If@@ E .
earlier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early to@@ oth loss .
the new long term study substanti@@ ates these findings .
archa@@ e@@ ologists discover ancient remains on the banks of the R@@ hin@@ e at C@@ olo@@ g@@ ne
archa@@ e@@ ological finds have again been made on the right bank of the R@@ hin@@ e in C@@ olo@@ g@@ ne .
archa@@ e@@ ologists from the Roman Ger@@ man@@ ic Museum have un@@ earth@@ ed sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new R@@ hin@@ e Bou@@ lev@@ ard is being constructed , said museum Director Mar@@ cus Tri@@ er on Tu@@ es@@ day .
historians have been in search of so-called architec@@ tural monuments since the start of construction work on the R@@ hin@@ e .
the museum , as the department for archa@@ e@@ ological mon@@ ument conservation , is always consulted when construction projects are carried out in the city district of C@@ olo@@ g@@ ne .
the archa@@ e@@ ologists made a find in the third construction phase of the R@@ h@@ ein Bou@@ lev@@ ard .
it is already known from text documents that a for@@ tress stood on this spot in the 4@@ th century , and in the 8@@ th century a church , explained Tri@@ er .
besides the remains of the for@@ tress and the church to@@ wer , a c@@ eme@@ tery with around 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belonged to the church , has also been discovered .

EU Commission proposes new court in controversy over T@@ T@@ I@@ P
to defuse the controversy over the planned Tran@@ satlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership , T@@ T@@ I@@ P , the EU Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
according to this , the disputed private arbit@@ ration board for conflicts between corporations and countries would be replaced by a transparent system which cor@@ responds considerably more in its function to traditional courts .
`` We want to set up a system which citizens trust , &apos;&apos; stated the responsible EU Commissioner , C@@ ec@@ i@@ lia Mal@@ strö@@ m , when introducing it .
the Swe@@ de plans to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
the German government has announced its support .
the creation of T@@ T@@ I@@ P will result in the largest free trade zone in the world , covering 800 million people .
plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
they should come in equal proportions from the EU , the USA and from non-@@ member countries .
for the first time , a second instance is also provided for .
this would allow for appeals to be made against jud@@ gements .
up to now , the parties to proceedings have agreed on the arbit@@ rator among themselves and there has been no possibility of appeal against their jud@@ gements .
in the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system to be fair and just , comm@@ ented Mal@@ strö@@ m .
in the long term , according to her statement , she wants to aim at an international investment court .
in this , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be cleared up .
investor State Disp@@ ute S@@ ett@@ lement -LRB- IS@@ DS -RRB- , which is required particularly by large companies , is said to be one of the main reasons for the stiff opposition to the T@@ T@@ I@@ P in Europe .
traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ sed by adversaries as a form of parallel justice through which companies are able to fight for compensation at the expense of tax pay@@ ers , make national laws null and vo@@ id , or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental protection standards .
in initial reactions , anti T@@ T@@ I@@ P organis@@ ations such as Cap@@ act called the EU Commission &apos;s proposals inadequate .
there was criticism in particular that they would not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada -LRB- C@@ eta -RRB- .
the German Secretary of State for the Economy , Mat@@ thi@@ as Mach@@ nig -LRB- SPD -RRB- , on the other hand , referred to the plans as major progress .
the Commission included in the reforms key points which Federal Economics Minister Si@@ g@@ mar Gabriel developed with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is off the table .
the French government , too , welcomed Mal@@ strö@@ m &apos;s plans .
the European business association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned against restricting the options for industry to take legal action with too many new rules .
small and medium sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged , they said .
when talks over the T@@ T@@ I@@ P free trade agreement can be concluded was still unclear on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
negotiations have been taking place since the middle of 2013 .
the issue of investor protection , however , has to date not been discussed with the USA .
it was originally planned for a structure for the agreement to be completed by the end of this year .
this date is no longer tenable .
ex@@ qui@@ site fol@@ k from Su@@ f@@ jan Stevens in Ham@@ burg
el@@ even years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stevens sits on the stage in the Prime Club -LRB- now Lux@@ or -RRB- in C@@ olo@@ g@@ ne .
beside him stands a fli@@ p chart on which the sh@@ y-@@ seeming fol@@ k singer has drawn the pic@@ tu@@ res@@ que US state of Mich@@ i@@ gan in f@@ elt@@ -@@ tip pen .
the entire audience , some 40 people , is virtually mes@@ mer@@ ised by Stevens &apos;s performance .
referring to different places , which each time he marks on the map , he talks about the stories behind his meti@@ culously and sub@@ tly con@@ tri@@ ved son@@ gs .
where they originated , and what it looks like , in his home country .
since then Stevens has proved himself to be a wonder@@ fully creative n@@ ut@@ case .
his third al@@ bu@@ m , `` gre@@ etings from Mich@@ i@@ gan : the Great Lake State , &apos;&apos; released in 2003 , features cle@@ ver@@ ly composed son@@ gs which cling harmon@@ ically to the traditions of American fol@@ k rock of the late six@@ ties , but which might drift at any time into amazing op@@ ul@@ ence .
Ru@@ mo@@ ur has it that `` Mich@@ i@@ gan &apos;&apos; was the first part of a bold series : it was to have been followed by son@@ gs about each of the 50 United States .
but in 2004 in the R@@ hin@@ e area , `` S@@ even Sw@@ ans &apos;&apos; came out , bursting positive expectations .
Stevens seems to have down@@ sized here .
playing live he only needs a gu@@ it@@ ar and ban@@ jo .
one year later the New Yor@@ k@@ -based musi@@ cian returns to his series .
with `` Il@@ lin@@ ois &apos;&apos; -LRB- `` Su@@ f@@ jan Stevens inv@@ ites You To : come On Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ o@@ ise &apos;&apos; -RRB- in 2005 , a widely acc@@ la@@ imed master@@ piece is released .
exuber@@ ant with ideas and sty@@ listic sophistication .
the al@@ bu@@ m clim@@ bs the American bil@@ l@@ board char@@ ts and appears in every best al@@ bu@@ m of the year list in the influential music press .
after extremely productive experiments Stevens then serves up `` The Age of Ad@@ z &apos;&apos; -LRB- 2010 -RRB- , an elaborate electronic set piece .
this sixth proper studi@@ o al@@ bu@@ m is still broadly orchestrated , but supported by program@@ med sequences or be@@ ats and plays with a variety of effects and echoes .
long since moved on from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here are becoming c@@ olo@@ ur@@ ful spectac@@ les with ne@@ on head@@ bands and huge flu@@ or@@ escent stage dec@@ or@@ ations .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stevens is to@@ uring Germany as part of a five-@@ man band .
Ham@@ burg Me@@ hr kept in the dark !
since March the the@@ at@@ re has primarily presented `` Car@@ ri@@ e and Lo@@ well . &apos;&apos;
although an audience of almost 2000 sit sp@@ ell@@ bound in their seats , the clearly more mature Stevens returns to intim@@ acy and to fol@@ k .
without directing a word at the public the group of excellent musi@@ cians plays through the widely enriched al@@ bu@@ m .
from the audience one can hear : the performance is more `` op@@ ul@@ ent &apos;&apos; and it makes you want to `` Ch@@ u@@ ck away the al@@ bu@@ m . &apos;&apos;

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n to make de@@ but at Prime Minister &apos;s Qu@@ es@@ tions
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s de@@ but at PM@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ enly awaited
new Labour leader Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his de@@ but at Prime Minister &apos;s Qu@@ es@@ tions later , taking on David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six al@@ lot@@ ted questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance likely to be closely scru@@ tin@@ ised by the media and Labour MPs .
he has called for `` less the@@ at@@ re and more facts &apos;&apos; at the weekly show@@ piece .
he has also said he could sk@@ ip some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the T@@ UC annual congress on Tu@@ es@@ day .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to stand in silence during the sin@@ ging of the national an@@ them at a service on Tu@@ es@@ day to mark the 7@@ 5@@ th anniversary of the B@@ attle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had `` stood in respec@@ tful silence &apos;&apos; and did recogni@@ se the `` hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the B@@ attle of Britain . &apos;&apos;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told BBC Two &apos;s New@@ sni@@ ght programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them `` irrespective &apos;&apos; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , citing differences over the economy , def@@ ence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspon@@ dent Robin Bran@@ t says policy differences are also `` st@@ ack@@ ing up &apos;&apos; within Labour following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment over its position on the European Union and the government &apos;s cap on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the T@@ UC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secretary , said the party was `` very clear &apos;&apos; that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 2@@ 6,000 to £ 2@@ 3,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the desp@@ at@@ ch box over the past decade since he became T@@ ory leader .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has `` crowd sourced &apos;&apos; ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ ling@@ ton North M@@ P has said PM@@ Q@@ s is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refrain from both `` repar@@ tee &apos;&apos; and trading bar@@ bs , instead vo@@ wing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela E@@ ag@@ le , the shadow business secretary , will de@@ pu@@ tise for him at PM@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is trav@@ elling abroad .
he has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had approached the Comm@@ ons Speaker John Ber@@ cow to discuss the issue .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the `` Pun@@ ch and Ju@@ dy &apos;&apos; style of politics often associated with PM@@ Q@@ s but admitted some years later that he had failed .
since it was first televised in 1990 , PM@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key bar@@ ometer of a leader &apos;s jud@@ gement , their command of the Comm@@ ons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caric@@ ature and is in need of far-reaching reforms .

pound rises as UK wage growth acceler@@ ates
the pound jumped following data showing a p@@ ick@@ -up in UK wage growth , while the FT@@ S@@ E 100 was led higher by bid target SA@@ B@@ Mil@@ ler .
between May and July , UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9 % compared with the same period last year .
the rate was the fastest since 2009 , and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise .
sterling rose more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up 0.@@ 84 % against the euro at € 1.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 30 .
the FT@@ S@@ E 100 index closed up 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 2@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Mil@@ ler was the stand@@ -out stock on the market , jump@@ ing 20 % after it received a bid approach from rival A@@ B In@@ Bev .
a deal would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wers , bringing together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stell@@ a Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ ber@@ ry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ ont &apos;s latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ ber@@ ry - had begun to grow again .
shares in Glen@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said it had raised $ 2.@@ 5@@ bn through a share plac@@ ement as part of its debt-@@ cutting strategy .
shares in pack@@ aging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest fall@@ ers on the index , down 4.3 % , after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the firm to `` sell . &apos;&apos;
J@@ D S@@ ports rose 3.1 % after the spor@@ ts@@ wear firm reported an 83 % jump in half-@@ year pre-@@ tax profits to £ 4@@ 6.@@ 6@@ m .
J@@ D S@@ ports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
J@@ D S@@ ports Executive Chairman Peter Cow@@ gi@@ ll says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean `` more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers . &apos;&apos;
but that spending power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs at his firm , he says .
the costs could hit J@@ D S@@ ports &apos; expansion plans , he added , which could mean fewer extra jobs .

a ridi@@ culous 21 years young , a wi@@ mp@@ y k@@ id with a too tr@@ end@@ y haircut .

probably even more .
at the moment Mon@@ sie@@ ur B@@ ie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the under-@@ 17 generation is going ber@@ ser@@ k .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ sk@@ a .
the 15-@@ year-old has never heard the name Rit@@ z Car@@ l@@ ton .
not so bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Justi@@ n yesterday .
including E@@ va and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
but the Poles have been sitting on the cold stone sl@@ ab in front of the luxury Berlin hotel on the Pot@@ s@@ dam@@ er Platz since 7 o@@ &apos;@@ clock in the morning .
the B@@ ie@@ ber building : their i@@ do@@ l , whose face appears on huge numbers of post@@ ers in Sz@@ c@@ z@@ ec@@ in , has been staying here since Mon@@ day evening .
the su@@ ite where the Canadian singer is staying costs as much for one night as her mother E@@ wa earns in six months .
at least .
she says : `` My Vik@@ tori@@ a should really be sitting in the 10@@ th class in the gra@@ m@@ mar school at the moment . &apos;&apos;
`` I &apos;m fulfilling her dream for her . &apos;&apos;
compulsory education ?
who wants that ?
not the fans .

he is financially secure anyway .
he is earning three million for advertising in the commercial break at the Sup@@ er bo@@ wl , a two-year deal with an anti-@@ spot company po@@ urs many many dollars into B@@ ie@@ ber &apos;s account .

some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others point out that after all B@@ ie@@ ber is char@@ ting in both the USA and Great Britain with his new single `` What do you mean ? &apos;&apos; at number one .

Pe@@ gi@@ da po@@ ster suggests the idea of po@@ tat@@ o don@@ er Ke@@ bab@@ s to Lebanese man
po@@ tat@@ oes or don@@ er ke@@ b@@ ab ?
you can have both - in the po@@ tat@@ o ke@@ b@@ ab that Ol@@ den@@ burg sn@@ ack bar owner H@@ ani Al@@ ha@@ y has created .
inspired by the slogan `` po@@ tat@@ oes instead of Ke@@ bab@@ s &apos;&apos; on a Pe@@ gi@@ da movement po@@ ster , Al@@ ha@@ y put po@@ tat@@ oes and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
a po@@ ster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the slogan `` po@@ tat@@ oes instead of Ke@@ bab@@ s &apos;&apos; which he happened to see on television gave him the idea .
since then a sp@@ it laden with meat and po@@ tat@@ oes has been rotating in his shop .
`` That is multi-@@ cultural food ! &apos;&apos; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
now he has registered his idea at the patent office in Munich .
according to officials there it is now protected as a registered design .
because of this , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to reveal how much meat and how many po@@ tat@@ oes the sp@@ it holds .
just enough so that , `` They taste much better together , &apos;&apos; he reck@@ ons .
customers also appreciate this international cul@@ inary understanding .
Met@@ cash laun@@ ches grassroots campaign to fight Al@@ di incur@@ sion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect its I@@ G@@ A stores from an Al@@ di ons@@ laught in South Australia and Western Australia .
gro@@ cer@@ y whol@@ es@@ aler Met@@ cash has k@@ icked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of I@@ G@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
as Al@@ di prepar@@ es to open two distribution cent@@ res and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ G@@ A super@@ markets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the I@@ G@@ A brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Ad@@ el@@ ai@@ de show .
I@@ G@@ A retailers and suppliers are jump@@ ing on board , with brands such as D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ -based ice cre@@ am maker Sim@@ mo &apos;s offering taste testing at I@@ G@@ A stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league ti@@ ckets to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to reveal more details of its def@@ ence strategy on September 29 , when the food , li@@ qu@@ or and hardware whol@@ es@@ aler hosts its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ cash &apos;s I@@ G@@ A store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ cash &apos;s I@@ G@@ A network in the eastern states .
South Australian and Western Australian sh@@ opp@@ ers are notoriously par@@ och@@ ial and I@@ G@@ A retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in N@@ S@@ W , Victoria and Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in wa compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Al@@ di will sn@@ are around 5 per cent of the gro@@ cer@@ y market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers .
in a report this week , Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Ki@@ er@@ ath estimated that I@@ G@@ A retailers could lose $ 3@@ 60 million a year in sales and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in wa next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss of food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales and volumes on Met@@ cash &apos;s high fixed-@@ cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , even though a recent Ro@@ y Morgan survey found I@@ G@@ A sh@@ opp@@ ers were most loyal .
Morgan Stanley believes Met@@ cash &apos;s food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016 , 4.@@ 1 per cent in 201@@ 7 and 2.1 per cent in 201@@ 8 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 1@@ 0.3 per cent by 2020 .
last week , leading fund manager Hami@@ sh Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash could `` highly , probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos; comments .
but it is understood that a Met@@ cash board member cont@@ acted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
I@@ G@@ A &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Met@@ cash &apos;s food and gro@@ cer@@ y business , which supplies about 1@@ 200 I@@ G@@ A retailers , have fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating delever@@ age as sales and margins come under pressure .
however , the whol@@ es@@ aler is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year matching shel@@ f prices at Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week , helping I@@ G@@ A retailers ref@@ ur@@ bi@@ sh stores by adding fa@@ ster@@ -@@ growing fresh food , and rolling out a better range of private label gro@@ c@@ eries .
Met@@ cash chief executive I@@ an Mor@@ rice says the price matching and store ref@@ ur@@ bish@@ ment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the whol@@ es@@ aler will return to underlying profit growth in 201@@ 7 , for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is backed by ten@@ nis Australia president Steve He@@ al@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves ku@@ do@@ s rather than criticism for his behavi@@ our .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend N@@ ick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves ku@@ do@@ s rather than criticism for his own behavi@@ our , according to ten@@ nis Australia president Steve He@@ al@@ y .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ o regularly referred to as the `` Special K@@ s , &apos;&apos; was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyr@@ gi@@ os sle@@ dge of St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Ma@@ sters .
in a fi@@ ery quali@@ fying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ ris@@ on twice had to be separated by the chair ump@@ ire , with Har@@ ris@@ on declaring : `` W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka should &apos;ve deck@@ ed Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should de@@ ck that k@@ id . &apos;&apos;
while he was last seen sm@@ ashing a ra@@ c@@ qu@@ et after cra@@ mp fo@@ iled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gas@@ qu@@ et , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is has been defended staun@@ ch@@ ly by He@@ al@@ y .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ go@@ w , competing with Sam Gro@@ th for the second sing@@ les ber@@ th behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi-@@ final against Britain .
`` One thing I do feel quite ke@@ enly about is I think Th@@ an@@ asi &apos;s been dragged into the fra@@ y a little bit , &apos;&apos; He@@ al@@ y said .
he did break a ra@@ c@@ qu@@ et when he lost when he cra@@ mp@@ ed in the US , but he &apos;s not the first player to break a ra@@ c@@ qu@@ et out of frustration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he would n&apos;t be proud of that .
but , really , he &apos;s handled himself extremely well , in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Har@@ ris@@ on and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of credit .
he &apos;s a great team around him , he &apos;s got a great family around him and I just think he &apos;s been a little hard done by .
he &apos;s a very mature 19@@ -year-old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he has n&apos;t ever had an issue with the other players , he &apos;s well respected in the lock@@ er room , he trains hard , he &apos;s in great shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
He@@ al@@ y also backed the decision to overlook Kyr@@ gi@@ os for the important tie , starting on Fri@@ day , describing the `` mutual decision &apos;&apos; as the right thing for all , but backing the Can@@ ber@@ ran to return as a long-term fix@@ ture in the team .
`` First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around -LSB- Kyr@@ gi@@ os -RSB- , &apos;&apos; He@@ al@@ y said .
and I think N@@ ick , he &apos;s risen very quickly , as people like Fe@@ derer and Mur@@ ray have pointed out , he &apos;s growing up in the public eye and he &apos;s made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we &apos;re trying to support him , we &apos;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the li@@ me@@ light where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe migrant crisis : Hungary declar@@ es emergency , se@@ als border , deta@@ ins migrants
declaring a state of emergency , Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tu@@ es@@ day and detained those trying to enter illegally , aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in .
chaos ensued at the border , as hundreds of migrants p@@ iled up in a no man &apos;s land , and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries &apos; check@@ points , those fleeing violence in their hom@@ el@@ ands pit@@ ched t@@ ents and settled in .
but frustrations were on the rise .
as a police helicopter ho@@ vered above , migrants chan@@ ted `` Open the border ! &apos;&apos; and sh@@ ou@@ ted insults at Hungarian ri@@ ot police .
some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it was `` unacceptable &apos;&apos; that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
-LRB- Serbia -RRB- wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
there will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &apos;&apos; I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the turmoil at the Hung@@ ari@@ an-@@ Serbian border came a day after the 2@@ 8-@@ nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
the ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hop@@ efully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 1@@ 20,000 more refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tu@@ es@@ day for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , was not p@@ inning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors .
Tu@@ es@@ day &apos;s state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases .
meanwhile , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country is also planning to build a ra@@ z@@ or-@@ wir@@ e fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country , now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border .
CB@@ S News correspon@@ dent Char@@ lie D@@ &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison inmates were en@@ listed in the race to finish the ra@@ z@@ or wir@@ e fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the last few months , Hungary has become a major bottlen@@ eck and entry point into the European Union for migrants , many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Orban , however , has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life , not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations , including Germany .
the new laws that took effect at mid@@ night in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-@@ meter -LRB- 13@@ -@@ foot -RRB- ra@@ z@@ or-@@ wir@@ e fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers .
`` due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es a state of crisis , &apos;&apos; government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Ko@@ vac@@ s told reporters in the southern city of S@@ ze@@ ged .
we are very clear on this : illegal border crossing is a crime .
technically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
G@@ y@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , homeland security adviser to Orban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country .
they got across by damaging the fence , are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws .
authorities are quickly repairing the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border cro@@ s@@ sings with Serbia on Tu@@ es@@ day morning after deploying a train car covered with ra@@ z@@ or wir@@ e to close one of them .
chaos en@@ velop@@ ed the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hung@@ arians opened a tiny office in a metal con@@ tain@@ er to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside .
about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary , saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary .

former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally , but Sen@@ . Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters -LRB- down from 58 percent -RRB- , while S@@ anders comes in second , with 27 percent -LRB- up from 17 percent -RRB- .
vice President Joe Biden , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
more than five months before the start of the primary con@@ tests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
since last month &apos;s CB@@ S News Pol@@ l , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders has made some gains .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates , but those leads have narrowed .
her support among men has dropped considerably and S@@ anders only tra@@ ils her by 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evap@@ orated , and she and S@@ anders are now even .
however , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders by double-@@ dig@@ its among liberals , but S@@ anders now has a 5-@@ point edge with this group .
about half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusias@@ tically support Clinton if she became the party &apos;s nominee .
a quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee .
six percent would not support her .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her .
views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support her .
while 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusias@@ tically back Clinton , fewer Republican voters say that about their fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner , Donald trump -LRB- 35 percent -RRB- .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee , the top answer is that she has the right experience -LRB- 16 percent -RRB- , followed by it &apos;s time for a woman president -LRB- 13 percent -RRB- , and that she is the best candidate for the job -LRB- 10 percent -RRB- .
also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton -LRB- 9 percent -RRB- .
agreement on the issues , and elec@@ tability are also cited .
as the vice president weighs a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third do n&apos;t think he should .
when Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party &apos;s nomination , Biden is the top pick .
among Clinton supporters , more than half say Biden would be their second choice , far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead over S@@ anders wi@@ dens , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
Fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
Biden is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most elec@@ table has risen .
still , when asked which is more important in a nominee , Democratic voters pick issues over elec@@ tability .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key characteristics among their party &apos;s primary voters .
majorities see Clinton , S@@ anders and Biden as honest and trust@@ worthy and as having strong leadership qualities .
Biden does the best of the three on honesty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
thirty percent of Democratic primary voters do n&apos;t think Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many as say that about S@@ anders -LRB- 15 percent -RRB- , but 27 percent do n&apos;t have an opinion of him on this .
democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Biden as in line with their views ideologically .
on all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions continue about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and ser@@ ver while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it has n&apos;t imp@@ acted their overall views of her .
but it &apos;s a different story among the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dissatis@@ fied with her explanation , while just about a third are satisfied .
the public &apos;s views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
it is mainly Republicans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trust@@ worthy by her party &apos;s voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and trust@@ worthy , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
Six@@ ty-@@ two percent of registered voters do n&apos;t think of her as honest and trust@@ worthy .
at the same time , 55 percent of registered voters nationwide do n&apos;t see trump as honest and trust@@ worthy either .
both Clinton and trump , however , get good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Biden , Car@@ son and Bush do the best on honesty .
more see S@@ anders as honest than not , but like Car@@ son , many do n&apos;t have an opinion of him .
the margin of error for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws close behind Donald trump in national poll
Ben Car@@ son is running close behind Donald trump in the newest CB@@ S News @/@ New York Times poll
the two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll , leaving others sc@@ ro@@ ung@@ ing for a fo@@ oth@@ old
Republican voters nationwide continue to back trump in large numbers , clim@@ bing from 23 % support in the last CB@@ S poll , conducted before the Fox News debate last month , to 27 % in the poll out Tu@@ es@@ day .
but Car@@ son rock@@ eted in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also found Car@@ son doing well across demographic groups , ed@@ ging out trump among colle@@ ge-@@ educated Republican voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and O@@ hi@@ o Go@@ v. John Ka@@ sich , has sli@@ pped behind with Wis@@ consi@@ n Go@@ v. Scot@@ t Wal@@ ker falling far@@ th@@ est from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
former Florida Go@@ v. Je@@ b Bush , former Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Go@@ v. Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ . Mar@@ co Ru@@ bi@@ o all tied for third place with 6 % .
the margin of error for the 3@@ 7@@ 6-@@ person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is pl@@ us-@@ or-@@ minus 6 % , and was conducted S@@ ept .
the latest CNN @/@ OR@@ C survey , released last week , showed Car@@ son rising in the polls -- landing at 19 % support among Republicans , behind trump &apos;s 32 % support .
the latest poll from A@@ BC News @/@ Washington Post also showed trump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
facing a rising Car@@ son last week , trump took some pot@@ shots at the retired neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on , even as Car@@ son apologi@@ zed for questioning trump &apos;s faith .
`` We need energy , &apos;&apos; trump said last Satur@@ day during a campaign stop in I@@ owa .
pleasant temperatures for ba@@ thing : the eastern Mediterranean is currently as warm as 29 degrees
even if peak levels are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for be@@ ach lovers to find warm water .
a dip in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea can only be a brief treat with temperatures at a maximum of 17 degrees .
many people no longer go into the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic this week is a maximum of 18 degrees , according to the German Met@@ eor@@ ological office -LRB- D@@ W@@ D -RRB- .
the Mediterranean , by contrast , offers suitable temperatures for ba@@ thing : in the east they are as high as 29 degrees .
in the A@@ dri@@ atic peak temperatures are 25 degrees , and in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five frat@@ ernity members charged in death of Bar@@ uch College fre@@ sh@@ man
nearly two years after a college student died during a frat@@ ernity ha@@ zing ritual in Pennsylvania &apos;s Po@@ con@@ o Mo@@ un@@ tains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
members of New York City &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i Delta P@@ S@@ I frat@@ ernity brutally assaul@@ ted Ch@@ un `` Michael &apos;&apos; Deng during an initi@@ ation ri@@ te in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
officials said he was blin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded , saddled with a 30-@@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field .
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious .
P@@ i Delta P@@ S@@ I frat@@ ernity members did not call 9@@ 11 after Deng passed out , and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
they did , however , find time to change Deng &apos;s clothes , Google his symptoms , and contact An@@ dy Men@@ g , the frat@@ ernity &apos;s national president to seek advice , Poli@@ ce Chief Chris Wag@@ ner said at a news conference .
`` At this point , members began to hide par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and basically put the frat@@ ernity &apos;s well-being over that of Michael Deng &apos;s , &apos;&apos; Chief Wag@@ ner said .
he could not be revived and he died the next morning .
according to an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head , tor@@ so , and thi@@ ghs .
`` To@@ o many families have been devastated as a result of frat@@ ernity ha@@ zing , with at least one student dying every year from ha@@ zing since 1970 , &apos;&apos; Dou@@ glas Fi@@ er@@ berg , an att@@ or@@ ney representing Deng &apos;s family , said in a statement .
F@@ rat@@ erni@@ ties and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
a Mon@@ ro@@ e Coun@@ ty grand jury recommended third-@@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
Thir@@ ty-@@ two other frat@@ ernity members , including Mr. Men@@ g , will also be charged with assault ha@@ zing and criminal conspiracy .
`` We want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there &apos;s an organization that sanctioned it , whether officially or un@@ officially , we &apos;re going to hold them accountable as well , &apos;&apos; Wag@@ ner said at a news conference Tu@@ es@@ day .
Bar@@ uch College banned the frat@@ ernity and the national frat@@ ernity re@@ vo@@ ked its affi@@ liation with the local chapter .
here &apos;s what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
a rate hike will come and the bul@@ l market will stum@@ ble , bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession .
this we know .
what we do n&apos;t know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
a recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressi@@ veness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
that &apos;s why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to norm@@ alize .
there are , indeed , multiple variables at play .
in the end , however , market participants may find that all the rate@@ -@@ hike f@@ uss may have been over@@ done .
`` The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of ` cheap money , &apos; `` Julian J@@ ess@@ op , chief global economist at Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
that &apos;s not to say there wo n&apos;t be effects , however .
here &apos;s a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
once the hike hits , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
`` It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12@@ -@@ 24 months after the first hike , which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy , &apos;&apos; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes .
more specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days after -LRB- average gain of 2.6 percent -RRB- then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cycles of 14@@ .@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis Bob dol@@ l , chief equity strategi@@ st at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , post@@ ed on Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate@@ -@@ hi@@ king cycle and returns begin to diminish .
recessions are a fact of economic life , but rate hikes often help them along .
in the current case , the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could ha@@ sten a recession .
most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike .
according to Deutsche Bank , in the 1@@ 18 rate hikes since 1950 , only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent , according to the Atlanta Fed .
hi@@ king rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of `` whether this time is different , &apos;&apos; Deutsche said .
market participants have been bra@@ cing for a Fed hike all year , with all eyes turned toward this week &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which ends Th@@ urs@@ day .
while many strategists and economists believe the FO@@ M@@ C could approve a hike at this meeting , futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability .
`` In our study since 1950 , all hi@@ king cycles to date have been in a sup@@ er cycle of increasing leverage with GDP eclip@@ sing pr@@ er@@ ec@@ ession pe@@ aks very quickly post the recovery commen@@ cing , &apos;&apos; the report said .
by contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
the current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticip@@ ates a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience .
the principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy .
for bonds , it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike @/@ cut in the cycle arrives .
at the end of the hi@@ king cycle bond yields fall immediately , &apos;&apos; Deutsche said .
Charles Schw@@ ab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer@@ - and shor@@ ter-@@ dated bonds to move closer together , fl@@ atten@@ ing the curve .
high-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though `` we are still cautious about stret@@ ching for yield , &apos;&apos; Kath@@ y Jones , fixed income analyst at Schw@@ ab , said in an analysis .
interestingly , Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations .
`` In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , &apos;&apos; she wrote .
short-term interest rates are up , the yield curve is flat@@ ter , credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tigh@@ tens policy .
broadly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinationals with lots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
`` History shows that ` quality &apos; stocks tend to out@@ perform during the three months following an initial rate hike , &apos;&apos; Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients .
firms with strong balance sheets out@@ paced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hikes , by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also out@@ performed their lower quality counterparts , by an average of 4 -LRB- percentage points -RRB- and 3 -LRB- percentage points -RRB- , respectively .
debt will become a big issue .
companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most , Goldman said .
outside pure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar .
savers could see gains as well through higher yields at the , though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of C@@ las@@ sic F@@ M says M@@ P Andrew Bin@@ gh@@ am
conservative M@@ P Andrew Bin@@ gh@@ am critici@@ sed station for ` dum@@ bing down &apos;
argues it &apos;s becoming increasingly indi@@ st@@ ingui@@ shable from commercial rival
also took aim at the BBC Musi@@ c A@@ wards , saying they just ri@@ p off the Bri@@ ts
colleague D@@ ami@@ en Coll@@ ins M@@ P attacked The Vo@@ ice , saying that too was n&apos;t original
BBC Radio 3 is `` turning into &apos;&apos; C@@ las@@ sic F@@ M , a leading M@@ P has claimed , pil@@ ing fresh pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that it does something that commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers do not .
conservative M@@ P Andrew Bin@@ gh@@ am also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be `` dum@@ bing down &apos;&apos; and is becoming increasingly indi@@ st@@ ingui@@ shable from its commercial rival .
`` Radio 3 seems to be - I do n&apos;t like to use the word `` dum@@ bing down &apos;&apos; - but it seems to be turning into C@@ las@@ sic F@@ M , &apos;&apos; he said .
he also took aim at the BBC Musi@@ c A@@ wards , launched last December .
the BBC Musi@@ c A@@ wards which started last year seem to be the Bri@@ ts by another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you &apos;re actually just mi@@ mi@@ cking what is already on the market , &apos;&apos; Mr Bin@@ gh@@ am said .
BBC director general denied the charges , arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else .
and it &apos;s commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
`` And also , Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and commission@@ ing new works I think is also really important , &apos;&apos; he said .
earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 controll@@ er Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past , because Britons are less educated about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC &apos;s output which came under fire for tre@@ ading on the to@@ es of commercial rivals , during the Cul@@ ture , Medi@@ a and sport select committee hearing .
T@@ ory M@@ P D@@ ami@@ en Coll@@ ins attacked The Vo@@ ice - the musi@@ cal talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Medi@@ a at an estimated cost of £ 2@@ 2@@ million .
can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive ?
Lord H@@ all insisted that the B@@ BC@@ 1 show - which stars Pal@@ oma Fai@@ th and Bo@@ y George as judges - was produced `` in a particularly BBC way . &apos;&apos;
he added that he wants the Corporation to `` find a hit from our own in-@@ house stable &apos;&apos; next time it laun@@ ches an entertainment series .
however , he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Vo@@ ice in the future , or spending L@@ ic@@ ence fee pay@@ ers &apos; money on other entertainment form@@ ats .
Internet sales increased at slow@@ est ever rate in August and Black Fri@@ day may be to blame
first three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
experts believe November &apos;s Black Fri@@ day could be holding back spending
for over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain &apos;s high streets into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales are le@@ veling off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
experts say there are signs that online sales are le@@ veling off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
` If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to ration@@ ali@@ se over time , &apos; An@@ dy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of IM@@ R@@ G sales index , told the Gu@@ ardi@@ an .
he explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when sh@@ opp@@ ers started using their mobile phones to make purchases .
it meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts , such as on the sof@@ a .
but now that is plat@@ e@@ au@@ ing a bit , you might see -LRB- growth -RRB- fall away .
the Black Fri@@ day phenomenon , which has been imported from America , is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales .
experts believe sh@@ opp@@ ers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Fri@@ day in November .
last year five times the average number of sh@@ opp@@ ers flo@@ cked to their computers to sn@@ ap up deals cra@@ shing a number of retailers web@@ sites .
experts believe Black Fri@@ day , which saw sh@@ opp@@ ers fight over bar@@ gains , could be holding sh@@ opp@@ ers off from making purchases
research published by the British retail Con@@ sortium found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
for some products , such as T@@ Vs and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online , rather than using high street fashion chains .
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca c@@ rane crash as Bin Laden family sanctioned
bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first fun@@ er@@ als take place in Mecca
come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Bin@@ ladi@@ n Group
the Health Ministry said a total of 3@@ 94 people were also injured after the c@@ rane cra@@ shed down
carried alo@@ ft through the streets , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a c@@ rane collapsed at Mecca &apos;s Grand mosque .
dressed largely in white , mour@@ ners pack@@ ed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-@@ Mo@@ ais@@ s@@ em c@@ eme@@ tery .
the sad possession passed by the holy site , where just days earlier a construction c@@ rane cra@@ shed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto wor@@ shi@@ pers .
the bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 of the wor@@ shi@@ pers killed when a c@@ rane cra@@ shed collapsed at Mecca &apos;s Grand Central Mos@@ que were carried through the streets
among the dead was fa@@ ther@@ -of-@@ four Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ra@@ m , from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , who was on his first pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge when the c@@ rane cra@@ shed down .
Mr Ak@@ ra@@ m had been in the Grand Mos@@ que with his parents ahead of the start of the annual Ha@@ j@@ j pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge .
Saudi officials have already vowed that the Ha@@ j@@ j to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to desc@@ end on the city .
today , King Salman said the Bin@@ ladi@@ n Group should not have left the c@@ rane &apos;s arm up when it was not in use .
an Arabic version of the decree , carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency , said the Bin@@ ladi@@ n Group was partly to blame for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English service did not report that detail , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from trav@@ elling abroad .
earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the c@@ rane to topple into a cour@@ ty@@ ard of the Grand Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have conver@@ ged ahead of the Ha@@ j@@ j pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge later this month .
Bin@@ ladi@@ n Group has not released any statements about the c@@ rane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment .
the royal decree also blamed the group for not using up@@ -to-@@ date safety measures and failing to coordinate with Met@@ eor@@ ological officials .
dozens of c@@ ran@@ es surround Mecca &apos;s Grand Mos@@ que , part of the massive construction effort headed by the Bin@@ ladi@@ n Group .
the Bin@@ ladi@@ n family has been close to Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and runs major building projects .
Al Qaida &apos;s late leader Osama bin Laden was a ren@@ eg@@ ade son di@@ sow@@ ned by the family in the 1990s .
the crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge , which is required at least once in the life of every able-@@ bo@@ died Muslim .
officials said 15@@ 8 people remain in hospital .
officials ordered one million ri@@ y@@ als -LRB- £ 17@@ 4,000 -RRB- be paid to the relatives of those killed , and the same amount to those permanently injured .
others injured will receive half that amount .
B &amp; Q boss says Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men working cheap is behind trend
Britons are increasingly employing hand@@ y@@ men says Ver@@ oni@@ que La@@ ury
number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe behind rise
resulting in 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , opening
at same time K@@ ing@@ fish@@ er is closing 60 B &amp; Q outlets across the country
by Rupert St@@ einer , Chief City correspon@@ dent for the Daily Mail
Britons are said to be putting down their ham@@ mers and pain@@ t@@ br@@ ush@@ es in fa@@ vo@@ ur of employing skilled Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men to carry out work in their home
if you are hand@@ y with a ham@@ mer or a whi@@ z@@ z at pain@@ ting walls , it seems you are in the minority these days .
because Britons are increasingly employing hand@@ y@@ men to carry out D@@ I@@ Y jobs in their homes , according to the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Ver@@ oni@@ que La@@ ury , new chief executive of K@@ ing@@ fish@@ er , which owns the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-@@ bottom prices is behind the trend .
as a result , K@@ ing@@ fish@@ er is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , while closing 60 B &amp; Q outlets .
M@@ rs La@@ ury said she wants more women to be employed in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex .
currently the majority of staff are men .
she said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
M@@ rs La@@ ury said : `` We still have a majority of men working in our stores .
we need to move more towards a balance .
fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women .
women play a big part in the decision-making process .
M@@ rs La@@ ury , who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain &apos;s FT@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading firms , has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors .
K@@ ing@@ fish@@ er is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
M@@ rs La@@ ury said : `` This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
K@@ ing@@ fish@@ er post@@ ed a fall in both half-@@ year profit and sales after the group shoul@@ dered the cost of sh@@ utting stores .
as a result of the trend K@@ ing@@ fish@@ er , which owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , is opening 200 new stores
officials from A@@ ich@@ -@@ D@@ ob in court for breach of trust
two officials from the Austrian vol@@ le@@ y@@ ball run@@ ner@@ -up champion team A@@ ich@@ -@@ D@@ ob attended the K@@ lagen@@ fur@@ t regional court on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day to answer charges of breach of trust and tax evasion .
the defendants p@@ lead@@ ed not guilty .
one of them had also also been charged with abuse of his position .
he was legally acqu@@ itted of this charge in May .
the current case was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to senior Public Prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ff@@ el , it emerged during preliminary investigations that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defendants used mon@@ ies from the club &apos;s accounts , to which they had access due to their roles , for private purposes .
the loss is estimated at around € 400,000 .
the sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences .
the chair@@ woman of the L@@ ay Judge Senate , Judge Mich@@ a@@ ela San@@ in , ordered proceedings on this fact to be postponed .
it will be tried at a later date .
on the charge of breach of trust , the def@@ ence argued that the club had never at any time suffered any pec@@ uni@@ ary disadvantage
the sports officials had only offset expense allowances , and brought the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested much time and money , out of debt - liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 60@@ 0,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings -LRB- around € 4@@ 4,000 -RRB- .
`` At that time we were faced with the situation of whether we should continue with the club or close it down , &apos;&apos; said one of the def@@ end@@ ents , who makes his living as an Au@@ di@@ tor of large companies for the tax authorities .
with his colleague and co-@@ def@@ endant , he had then resolved to undertake this task .
with all the risks .
`` We advanced money and deposi@@ ted our life insurance policies with the bank as security , &apos;&apos; he said during the examination .
it was agreed with the club that they had a free hand to manage the money , but they were not permitted to run up any debts .
furthermore , if there was appropriate financial success , retro@@ spec@@ tive payment of the expense allow@@ ance back to 1991 was agreed .
as a result , a part of the expense allow@@ ance was paid off years later , that is to say from the year 2003 when the account went into credit .
this is why general and not detailed deb@@ it ent@@ ries appeared , was the former chairman &apos;s explanation for the processes .
the two defendants managed the accounts and pass@@ books together , said the second def@@ endant .
the Judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the club in detail .
the club was not interested in details of the financial arrangements , it was only important that it should be debt free , was the answer .
when investigations into abuse of his position against one of the officers began in 2011 , a sum of € 1@@ 20,000 was transferred into the club &apos;s account .
those were reserves , explained the def@@ endant .
this securities account was run in the name of the two defendants and according to a statement by the club its existence was not known to the club .
`` Why ? &apos;&apos; the Judge wanted to know .
there was no answer to this for a long time .
then he finally said that he had thought it would be best for the club .
had something happen to him then nobody would have known anything about this money , the State Prosec@@ utor put to the room .
the co-@@ def@@ endant knew about it , the official justified himself .
the purpose of the transfer was given as compensation for damages .
`` Why compensation for damages ? &apos;&apos; the Judge and the State Prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
in response , the first def@@ endant said that he had dis@@ agreed with this wor@@ ding because no damage had ever occurred to the club .
but what can I do when the lawyer says , `` This lets us all off the hook &apos;&apos; ?
`` Am I a legal representative ? &apos;&apos; he asked .
the official carried on that he had never received a cent in salary , he had only charged for mi@@ lea@@ ge and a per di@@ em allow@@ ance .
the club had set aside € 1,000 per month for per di@@ em allowances , which were in fact expenses which would have been much higher , he added .
the defendants were not able to provide accurate docum@@ entation for the earlier years .
this was no longer kept since an audi@@ t in which everything was properly assessed , they explained .
the second def@@ endant had also obtained a mi@@ lea@@ ge allow@@ ance .
all adjustments were made in cash , for which he had to drive from his home in Völker@@ markt to the bank in Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard cutting a further 30,000 jobs
in addition to the job cuts that have been taking place for the past three years , the computer giant is going to lay off even more staff with the split@@ ting of the company .
there seems to be no end to the job cuts at the US computer giant He@@ wle@@ t@@ t-@@ Pack@@ ard -LRB- H@@ P -RRB- .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to lay off between 25,000 and 30,000 staff in its corporate custom@@ er section .
this should lead to cost savings of around $ 2.7 billion -LRB- € 2.4 billion -RRB- , the company disclosed on Tu@@ es@@ day .
the step will lead to a one-@@ off charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs which has been taking place for three years is not yet completed .
at the end of the 2013 @/@ 14 business year H@@ P still employed around 30@@ 2,000 staff .
at the end of trading He@@ wle@@ t@@ t-@@ Pack@@ ard shares had fallen by 2.3 percent .
the group based in Palo Al@@ to , California , which initially grew through its prin@@ ter sales , is currently split@@ ting its business : this year the computer and prin@@ ter side will be combined in a new company , separated from the the promising areas of computer ser@@ vers and data storage for business as well as other services .
both operations will be listed on the stock exchange .
repeatedly disappointing sales of PC@@ s as well as a slow demand from business customers for their services have recently afflicted the world &apos;s second-largest PC manufactur@@ er after Len@@ o@@ vo .
in the third fiscal quarter to the end of July , sales of PC@@ s and pr@@ inter@@ s fell by 1@@ 1.5 percent .
revenue dropped by eight percent to just under $ 25@@ .@@ 4 billion .
this means profits have dropped in 15 out of 16 quarters .
H@@ P responded to the changes in the industry with a split and massive layoffs .
the 7@@ 6-@@ year-old business headed by Me@@ g Wh@@ it@@ man has been slow to react to the rise in customers buying smar@@ t@@ phones and tab@@ lets instead of conventional computers and equally carrying out business more and more online .
Wh@@ it@@ man &apos;s plans for restructuring include around 5@@ 5,000 job losses .
conflicts : the majority support anti IS@@ IS training mission
the majority of people , however , are opposed to direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq : 54 percent were against it , 35 percent have expressed themselves in fa@@ vo@@ ur .
Six@@ ty-@@ one percent reacted positively to other countries carrying out air attacks against IS@@ IS in Iraq and Syria .
twenty-@@ four percent are against intervening in the conflict .
Fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ one percent of those surve@@ yed are against cooperating with the Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad , but 20 percent were in fa@@ vo@@ ur .
twenty-@@ nine percent were un@@ decided .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence on the Serbi@@ an-@@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have used te@@ ar gas and water c@@ ann@@ ons against several hundred angry refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
Eur@@ on@@ e@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el B@@ oz@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
a line of police was formed behind it and behind the police a water c@@ ann@@ on stood at the ready .
between 40 and 50 refugees started to throw stones , sticks and pl@@ astic bott@@ les at the officers .
at first the officers used a continuous spra@@ y of pe@@ pper spra@@ y .
then the police used te@@ ar gas .
a lot of te@@ ar gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
this caused the group to break up .
the group has now reluct@@ antly withdrawn .
a pregnant and obviously injured woman has been carried away from the area .
children who have in@@ hal@@ ed te@@ ar gas are scre@@ aming .
other refugees have sl@@ ump@@ ed down together and are suffering from respiratory distress .
the press spokesman for the Serbian police also sustained injuries from the use of te@@ ar gas and pe@@ pper spra@@ y .
decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
the world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day and Th@@ urs@@ day , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
a survey of 80 economists poll@@ ed by Re@@ u@@ ters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-@@ 0.@@ 25 percent range .
it &apos;s a historical event because it &apos;s been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero .
for the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates , &apos;&apos; said An@@ gel U@@ bi@@ de , senior fellow at the Pe@@ ter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation .
however the Fed can not ignore the less rosy global outlook .
it has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move .
the decision is due to be announced at 20@@ .@@ 00 CE@@ T on Th@@ urs@@ day .
Delta State University sho@@ oter left note of apo@@ logy
after shooting and killing his gir@@ l@@ friend in Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i on Mon@@ day morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Sh@@ ann@@ on lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was `` sorry &apos;&apos; for the first murder and wished he `` could take it back , &apos;&apos; authorities revealed Tu@@ es@@ day .
police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ . said lam@@ b , a geography and social science education instruc@@ tor at Delta State University , called 9@@ 11 around 10 a@@ .@@ m .
Mon@@ day and said he had shot and killed someone .
lam@@ b told the dispat@@ cher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
he said `` I shot my wife last night &apos;&apos; and also mentioned that there is a `` swe@@ et dog &apos;&apos; in the house that is `` not going to bother anyone &apos;&apos; but is likely upset .
police asked the call@@ er his name , but he did n&apos;t give it .
lam@@ b did not provide an explanation for the shooting .
when police got to the scene they found the body of Am@@ y P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from lam@@ b , 45 , that said : `` I am so sorry I wish I could take it back .
I loved Am@@ y and she is the only person who ever loved me .
after writing the note , lam@@ b drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a history professor , before eventually taking his own life late Mon@@ day as c@@ ops closed in .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did n&apos;t know of any conflict between lam@@ b and Schmidt but `` obviously there was something in Mr. lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &apos;&apos;
despite reports Mon@@ day that lam@@ b allegedly believed P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss was also roman@@ tically involved with Schmidt , authorities said Tu@@ es@@ day that there was `` no information , no evidence &apos;&apos; of a `` love tri@@ angle . &apos;&apos;
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss was described as a `` good person &apos;&apos; by Sha@@ wn O&apos;@@ St@@ een , who said he had been married to her for about seven years .
the two divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O&apos;@@ St@@ een said he and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was `` devastated . &apos;&apos;
he said P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss and her daughter were `` absolutely best friends . &apos;&apos;
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss worked an online job from her home , according to L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , identified as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss by the Sun Her@@ ald .
K@@ now@@ les said P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss , who had a ho@@ und dog named ligh@@ tn@@ ing , had been dating lam@@ b for about three years .
`` S@@ he always wanted to help other people , &apos;&apos; K@@ now@@ les said .
police said lam@@ b had ph@@ oned relatives at some point Mon@@ day to tell them `` he &apos;s not going to jail . &apos;&apos;
when c@@ ops caught up with him on High@@ way 1 near Gre@@ envi@@ lle later that night , lam@@ b pulled his car over , bailed out on foot , ran into the wo@@ ods and shot and killed himself .
lam@@ b received a doc@@ torate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015 , according to his resume post@@ ed on the university &apos;s web@@ site .

Eur@@ ow@@ ings : Luf@@ th@@ ans@@ a reconstruc@@ ting group
Luf@@ th@@ ans@@ a is planning a major reconstruction of its group .
the Luf@@ th@@ ans@@ a group will save half a billion Euros per year through improvements to the organisation alone .
reconstruction of the group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs .
meanwhile new negotiations are being carried out with the pi@@ lots &apos; union .
Luf@@ th@@ ans@@ a is re@@ organis@@ ing the structure of its business and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eur@@ ow@@ ings .
the goal of the realignment is a contribution to profits of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue sy@@ ner@@ gies , the airline announced on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
among other things , Luf@@ th@@ ans@@ a in the future will have no executive board for the passen@@ ger business .
the Eur@@ ow@@ ings budget airline will instead be developed to become as independent as possible .
in the future , Karl Ul@@ rich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eur@@ ow@@ ings on the management board headed by Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with this new realignment Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eur@@ ow@@ ings , with which the group wants to compete against Ryanair and E@@ as@@ y@@ jet in the future .
up to now the organisation of the 1@@ 20,000 employees has been extremely complex .
the airline is consolidating the passen@@ ger airline group , which provides three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion , under one umbrella .
new negotiations with pi@@ lots
following the strike which was halted on legal grounds , negotiations with the pi@@ lots &apos; union cock@@ pit -LRB- V@@ C -RRB- in the pay dispute will be resumed on Th@@ urs@@ day .
this was announced by the union .
under discussion will be the pi@@ lots &apos; retirement scheme .
`` In a year with record results predicted &apos;&apos; cock@@ pit wants to come up with a viable solution as quickly as possible
the conflict between the union and the airline had led to a number of strikes over the past months .

Manchester United &apos;s Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w out for months with double frac@@ ture
Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg during Manchester United &apos;s Champi@@ ons League defeat at P@@ S@@ V Ein@@ dho@@ ven .
while this left the full-@@ back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months , Louis van G@@ a@@ al remains hopeful Sha@@ w could play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reckless tackle from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moren@@ o in the 15@@ th minute after the 20-@@ year-old Sha@@ w had burst into the P@@ S@@ V area .
he had nine minutes of treatment on the pit@@ ch and required oxy@@ gen before being taken to hospital .
van G@@ a@@ al said : `` He has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &apos;&apos;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
it is awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fantas@@ tically and then this happens .
when it was in the dressing room he had an oxy@@ gen mask on .
he was c@@ rying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double frac@@ ture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Moren@@ o appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spo@@ t-@@ kick .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pen@@ ali@@ se the Mexican .
van G@@ a@@ al suggested the Italian official had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
it was a very bad tackle with two legs .
a t@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ w &apos;s account read : `` Th@@ ank you everyone for your messages , words ca n&apos;t describe how gut@@ ted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . &apos;&apos;
related : Manchester United suffer Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w blow in defeat at P@@ S@@ V
the England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Champi@@ on@@ ship in France next June .
Ph@@ illi@@ p Co@@ cu , the P@@ S@@ V co@@ ach , said : `` It &apos;s a very bad injury . &apos;&apos;
if any player goes off with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure an opponent .
Moren@@ o suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van G@@ a@@ al &apos;s Holland at the 2014 World Cup .
`` He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to inj@@ ure the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &apos;&apos; Co@@ cu said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he -LSB- Moren@@ o -RSB- touched it , but I could n&apos;t see the tackle on Lu@@ ke .
speaking to S@@ BS@@ 6 , Moren@@ o said : `` I know how it feels , I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it , I am so sorry .
P@@ S@@ V &apos;s Andrés Gu@@ ar@@ dad@@ o was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris S@@ m@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The L@@ or@@ a@@ x better than this ?
it &apos;s one thing any parent soon lear@@ ns : when your child lo@@ ves a book , it wo n&apos;t be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seems , you are David Cameron .
asked by a provider of holiday child@@ care schemes to name his fa@@ vo@@ ur@@ ite kids &apos; book , the prime minister opted for The L@@ or@@ a@@ x , the 1971 environmental f@@ able by D@@ r Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message published on the web@@ site of the Super@@ C@@ amp@@ s company , continuing : `` fun@@ ny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed . &apos;&apos;
all very well , except that the subsequent parag@@ rap@@ h in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a pr@@ é@@ c@@ is of the 2012 film version , which added new charac@@ ters and detail to pa@@ d out the fairly brief original text .
`` S@@ et in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need@@ -@@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Au@@ dre@@ y , by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , &apos;&apos; it reads , chron@@ ic@@ ling a love interest unknown to D@@ r Se@@ uss , real name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 .
if that was n&apos;t suspicious enough , Cameron &apos;s submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the L@@ or@@ a@@ x film provided on the Internet movie datab@@ ase web@@ site , which begins : `` In the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need@@ -@@ Vil@@ le , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Au@@ dre@@ y . &apos;&apos;
given he is an avo@@ w@@ edly hand@@ s-@@ on parent , it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book &apos;s plot , in which a young un@@ named boy he@@ ars how the local environment was devastated by the av@@ ar@@ ici@@ ous , tre@@ e-@@ ch@@ opping , th@@ need@@ -@@ kn@@ it@@ ting On@@ ce-@@ ler , despite the protests of the ep@@ on@@ ymous L@@ or@@ a@@ x , a squ@@ at , mou@@ stach@@ io@@ ed cre@@ ature who `` speaks for the trees . &apos;&apos;
most likely , such a relatively low@@ ly PR task would have been outsourced to an ai@@ de , seemingly one who has never read The L@@ or@@ a@@ x 20 times in a row to a child .
a D@@ owning Street spokes@@ woman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron &apos;s constituency office .
Super@@ C@@ amp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron &apos;s staff , but had no further immediate comment .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly at risk of England om@@ ission but it &apos;s still tough
taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assign@@ ment but after seeing the squ@@ ad England have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3-@@ 0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I would n&apos;t rule out an away win , either .
A@@ last@@ air Co@@ ok &apos;s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that bat@@ ting lin@@ eup and the collective mindset is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a youthful posi@@ tivity .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a sp@@ inner and A@@ di@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , represents an attacking option .
related : Adam Ly@@ th dropped from England Test squ@@ ad and replaced by Ale@@ x H@@ ales
the decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head co@@ ach at Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
his seven tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cri@@ ck@@ eters are judged on output .
there were no question marks over Joe root , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selec@@ tors .
a couple of half-@@ centuries and Ly@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny .
hop@@ efully if he pun@@ ches out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire another opportunity will come along .
the England head co@@ ach , Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss , praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
the question of how long a Test bat@@ sman gets to make his mark is a tough one .
Ly@@ th got seven caps - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while N@@ ick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance home and away .
the only gri@@ pe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Tro@@ tt in the Caribbean first - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now .
Ale@@ x H@@ ales comes in and he is a bat@@ sman I rate highly .
he is an X-@@ factor cri@@ ck@@ eter , which we at Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire saw early this season when he made 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bri@@ dge pit@@ ch that was doing a bit .
he must at least be affor@@ ded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the mak@@ e-up of the side in the U@@ AE .
the idea of Mo@@ een opening the bat@@ ting alongside Co@@ ok , which would get the extra sp@@ inner in while keeping four qu@@ ic@@ ks , has been floated and it is not something I am against .
I do n&apos;t see why a stro@@ k@@ em@@ aker can not bat there and this left-@@ h@@ ander has already shown he is one hell of a cri@@ ck@@ eter .
Mo@@ een may not have done the job for his coun@@ ty , Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ sh@@ ire , but he has been a No@@ 3 for them and there is not much difference .
my old te@@ am@@ -@@ mate Justi@@ n Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001 .
he pe@@ eled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes into the squ@@ ad as back@@ -up sp@@ inner and , in my limited dealings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
people may look at his raw St@@ ats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt but there are not a he@@ ap of sp@@ inn@@ ers putting their hands up and selec@@ tors have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squ@@ ad , England look to have made a couple of shrew@@ d addi@@ tions to their co@@ aching staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the Sri Lanka bat@@ sman , as a consult@@ ant for the Test matches could be a ma@@ st@@ erst@@ ro@@ ke .
he is one of the game &apos;s lo@@ v@@ eli@@ est blo@@ kes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes in for the whit@@ e-@@ ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless stre@@ ak into the set@@ up .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket , be it playing or co@@ aching , and like Mah@@ ela has n@@ ous that can be t@@ apped .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can fre@@ sh@@ en up a side .
Col@@ ly &apos;s D@@ U@@ R@@ HA@@ M te@@ am@@ -@@ mate Ben st@@ okes is rested for the one-@@ da@@ yers , root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
while not everyone will agree , the co@@ aches and selec@@ tors do not set the schedule .
and you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
such decisions are never taken lightly .
Bre@@ x@@ it camp might win the day if economy is in dol@@ dru@@ ms by 201@@ 7
David Cameron &apos;s half-@@ bak@@ ed renegoti@@ ation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes , even without the election of gen@@ ial Jer@@ emy `` Is it Yes or No ? &apos;&apos; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Labour leadership , or the T@@ UC cutting up rough over Europe on Tu@@ es@@ day .
foreigners have their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages too .
a European diplomat ch@@ um explained the other day that , sun@@ k in ass@@ or@@ ted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain &apos;s self-@@ absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes which they mostly do n&apos;t want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton for its annual bean , the T@@ UC decided it did n&apos;t want them either if they eroded social protection .
we could even call it Da@@ ve and George &apos;s sel@@ fi@@ e agenda .
P@@ M and chanc@@ ellor rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local mon@@ ument , with or without local gran@@ de@@ e , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
it &apos;s all about me .
my European p@@ al , who wants an out@@ ward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - `` Do n&apos;t leave us alone with France , &apos;&apos; says Berlin - suggests that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they do n&apos;t care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , Germany &apos;s cau@@ tiously le@@ vel@@ -@@ headed chanc@@ ellor , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for over@@ st@@ ay@@ ers Thatcher -LRB- 11 years -RRB- , Mitterrand -LRB- 14 -RRB- and Kohl -LRB- 16 -RRB- .
France &apos;s François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 201@@ 7 .
he is a fading force too .
Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
it &apos;s hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Sel@@ fi@@ e Bri@@ ts , whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they do n&apos;t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies .
so some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately un@@ helpful remarks , S@@ NP@@ -style , during the UK &apos;s 201@@ 7 referendum campaign to ha@@ sten the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my p@@ al suggests .
`` The renegoti@@ ation was a fix &apos;&apos; and `` Britain got nothing of value out of the renegoti@@ ation . &apos;&apos;
the Europeans know to their cost how predatory Fle@@ et Street can be and how EU-@@ sc@@ ep@@ tic the oligarch press bar@@ ons are , as they were not during the Tony Ben@@ n@@ -@@ inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may di@@ m@@ ly remember Boris Johnson , the arch Euro-@@ opportun@@ ist , making his name as an `` EU straight ban@@ an@@ as &apos;&apos; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 9@@ 0s .
for all his fooli@@ shness E@@ d Miliband knew who his enemies were .
they included the med@@ ley of tax-@@ shy ra@@ sc@@ als , ph@@ one-@@ hack@@ ing foreigners and pseu@@ do non-@@ doms who own most of our great newspapers .
actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them , but realis@@ ed that when you &apos;re in a cage with a rand@@ y gor@@ illa you have to pass the ban@@ an@@ as to distra@@ ct it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact Miliband was more Bla@@ iri@@ te than Blair in opposing Cameron &apos;s referendum whe@@ e@@ ze , since Blair had conc@@ eded the principle over the EU &apos;s abor@@ ted constitution , sun@@ k by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a ge@@ t-@@ out card .
the press never for@@ gave him that either .
but nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly p@@ at on the back at West@@ min@@ ster on Mon@@ day - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-@@ adopting N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boycott Murdoch strategy of the 8@@ 0s , a mistake then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sof@@ a he vac@@ ated on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is what I will kin@@ dly call evolving .
he says he &apos;d like us to stay in a reformed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ K@@ I@@ P &apos;s wo@@ ad@@ -@@ wearing tendency and the wil@@ der shores of T@@ ory little Eng@@ l@@ ander@@ ism can probably say yes to that .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary `` A Ben@@ n , but not a Ben@@ n@@ ite &apos;&apos; Ben@@ n said on radio and TV this week as the boy sc@@ out in him struggled not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of ab@@ ra@@ sive John Mc@@ D@@ onn@@ ell as shadow chanc@@ ellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 7@@ 0s , when his old dad struggled on TV to be dis@@ loyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was more attractive .
but fighting to stay in `` in all circumstances &apos;&apos; - Ben@@ n &apos;s phrase - was not what Mc@@ D@@ onn@@ ell was saying , nor what J@@ C told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Mon@@ day night , by all accounts .
whatever the bottom@@ -up , tou@@ ch@@ y-@@ fe@@ ely image Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember , he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24 @/@ 7 TV and especially in the ma@@ el@@ strom that is social media , a hot@@ bed of paranoia and betrayal .
it &apos;s fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour &apos;s support for granted in the referendum campaign , as Mc@@ D@@ onn@@ ell has said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ D@@ onn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic equi@@ voc@@ ation about EU membership - consistent with their Ben@@ n@@ ite siege economy , anti-@@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic discussion among le@@ ft@@ wing dissidents for whom the nar@@ ci@@ ssi@@ sm of small difference is a central ten@@ et of doctr@@ in@@ al squab@@ bles .
as with his equi@@ voc@@ ation over Nato - Tom Watson is adam@@ ant that J@@ C wo n&apos;t campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless ?
the US is already pretty disappointed with the Bri@@ ts &apos;&apos; feeble military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost-@@ cutting T@@ ory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Mon@@ day .
experts critici@@ se Public Health England e-@@ cigarettes review
claims by a government-@@ funded agency that e-@@ cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
experts writing in the British Medical Journal -LRB- BM@@ J -RRB- joined the Lancet in critici@@ sing the evidence used by Public Health England -LRB- PH@@ E -RRB- in its report on e-@@ cigarettes .
PH@@ E published the `` landmark &apos;&apos; report last month , describing it as a `` comprehensive review of the evidence . &apos;&apos;
but several researchers have questioned the robust@@ ness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the `` extraordinarily f@@ lim@@ sy foundation &apos;&apos; on which PH@@ E based its main conclusion .
writing in the BM@@ J , two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were `` built on rock or sand . &apos;&apos;
Martin Mc@@ Ke@@ e , professor of European public health at the London School of Hy@@ giene and Tro@@ p@@ ical Medic@@ ine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of clinical epidemi@@ ology at the University of Li@@ ver@@ pool , said : `` A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &apos;&apos;
they said the public would expect PH@@ E &apos;s claims that `` the current best estimate is that e-@@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &apos;&apos; would be based on a detailed review of evidence and mod@@ elling .
in fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-@@ criteria decision analysis -LRB- M@@ CD@@ A -RRB- model to synthe@@ si@@ se their opinions on the harms associated with different ni@@ cot@@ ine-@@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research paper .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said one spon@@ sor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco for an independent study .
he also endorsed bat &apos;s public health credentials in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-@@ cigar@@ ette manufactur@@ er but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the rationale for selec@@ ting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e-@@ cigar@@ ette champions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PH@@ E .
the research paper produced by the group `` tell@@ ingly conce@@ des &apos;&apos; there is a lack of `` hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria , &apos;&apos; Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PH@@ E report .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said PH@@ E &apos;s claims that `` there is no evidence so far that e-@@ cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-@@ smokers &apos;&apos; were premature .
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well@@ being at PH@@ E , said the claims in the BM@@ J had been responded to before .
he said : `` E@@ -@@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &apos;&apos;
one in two lifel@@ ong smokers dies from their addiction .
all of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-@@ cigarettes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long-term effects .
PH@@ E has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people a year die of a smo@@ k@@ ing-@@ related illness and smoking costs the N@@ H@@ S £ 2@@ bn a year .
by sp@@ elling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-@@ cigarettes are not risk-free , they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national re@@ mit .
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former Ch@@ ann@@ el 4 chief
the former Ch@@ ann@@ el 4 chairman Lu@@ ke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broad@@ casting program@@ mes such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Vo@@ ice , saying its commercial rivals would `` give their right arm &apos;&apos; for hit shows such as the Albert Square so@@ ap .
Johnson said the L@@ ic@@ ence fee should only be used to make the sort of program@@ mes that are not made by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critici@@ sed the BBC for putting public service program@@ mes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slo@@ ts against its rivals &apos;&apos; biggest rating shows , and on channels such as B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC &apos;s director general , Tony H@@ all , said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organis@@ ations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Ch@@ ann@@ el 4 to do a ti@@ e-up with the BBC without success .
`` I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts program@@ mes that would clearly be shown by un@@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed rivals , &apos;&apos; Johnson told the House of L@@ ords communication committee , as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC .
if you keep the L@@ ic@@ ence fee , which I &apos;m not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to program@@ mes that others are n&apos;t making and commission@@ ing .
they broadcast The Vo@@ ice in a prime s@@ lot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
the idea that no one else would show that is a joke , it &apos;s lu@@ dic@@ rous , it &apos;s obviously nonsense .
Johnson said : `` I do n&apos;t see why a regre@@ ssive tax should fund program@@ mes that could be funded without subsidy .
the Vo@@ ice is one , East@@ En@@ ders is another , admittedly made in-@@ house .
frankly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I struggle to see how it &apos;s public service broad@@ casting .
I do n&apos;t think that would diminish the BBC at all .
Johnson , a seri@@ al entrep@@ rene@@ ur who led Ch@@ ann@@ el 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was guilty of ch@@ asing ratings `` because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support . &apos;&apos;
his comments about the BBC &apos;s most popular shows echo those of former Sk@@ y executive Tony Ball , who used his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t lecture in Ed@@ in@@ burgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said the BBC &apos;s more ni@@ che public service program@@ mes `` go on to B@@ BC@@ 4 where quite often you ca n&apos;t measure the audience but they ful@@ fi@@ l their re@@ mit and they can argue when they go on their sanc@@ tim@@ oni@@ ous missions about justifying £ 4@@ bn in L@@ ic@@ ence fee income , `` Well of course , we do all these obscure program@@ mes that no one watched . &apos;&apos;
they put them on a s@@ lot where no one was ever going to watch them .
on the L@@ ic@@ ence fee , Johnson told the committee : `` I challenge you to find a more regre@@ ssive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
of course you all think , we all think , £ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they do n&apos;t consume a lot of the BBC .
former Sk@@ y and Ch@@ ann@@ el 5 executive David El@@ stein , who also gave evidence to the committee on Tu@@ es@@ day , said the BBC should revise its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to `` inform , educate and enter@@ tain . &apos;&apos;
he said little of the BBC &apos;s output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV output and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada and change it to `` inform , en@@ ligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &apos;&apos;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said only a handful were shown on TV , and enter into alliances with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make them all available to watch online .
` Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
the video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change direction the moment they are b@@ lasted with son@@ ic pul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change direction the moment they are b@@ lasted with son@@ ic pul@@ ses that are too high-@@ pit@@ ched for humans to hear .
the pul@@ ses work by swit@@ ching on motor neur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry mem@@ bran@@ e channels that respond to ultra@@ son@@ ic waves .
related : researchers read and write brain activity with light
researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure , dubbed son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultra@@ sound can be used to activ@@ ate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells from outside the body .
S@@ re@@ e@@ kan@@ th C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani , a rese@@ ar@@ cher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Gu@@ ardi@@ an that the procedure could one day replace deep-@@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pul@@ ses into people &apos;s brains to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
N@@ em@@ at@@ ode worms do not usually react to ultra@@ sound , but C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found , ampli@@ fy the ultra@@ son@@ ic waves which then pass inside the worms .
the amp@@ lified ultra@@ sound waves act on structures called TR@@ P@@ -@@ 4 i@@ on channels , found in the mem@@ bran@@ es of some of the worms &apos;&apos; cells .
the sound waves make these i@@ on channels open up and activ@@ ate the cells they are attached to , according to a report in Nature Commun@@ ications .
to make ultra@@ sound@@ -@@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des , C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TR@@ P@@ -@@ 4 i@@ on channels .
when he applied ultra@@ sound to the modified creatures , the sound waves were amp@@ lified by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted into the worms , where they swit@@ ched on the modified motor neurons .
the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pul@@ ses of light .
but C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani said that son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over that technique .
unlike light , which has to be sent down an op@@ tic fi@@ br@@ e to the desired location inside the brain , low frequency ultra@@ sound waves can pass through tissue un@@ hin@@ dered , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the sk@@ ull .
`` We believe that , using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it may be possible to make target human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultra@@ sound signal in a clinical setting for certain neur@@ ological treatments , &apos;&apos; said C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insu@@ lin@@ -@@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student h@@ alls
it &apos;s been 11 years since I moved into student h@@ alls as an obli@@ vious 19@@ -year-old , still believing in ber@@ ets and moral relati@@ vi@@ sm , but it &apos;s only now I recall the strained s@@ miles of those I anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be di@@ still@@ ed into eight simple rules .
moving into h@@ alls can range from mil@@ dly ner@@ ve-@@ ra@@ cking to totally terrifying .
it &apos;s tempting to bab@@ ble : telling people where you &apos;re from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on Cor@@ by@@ n and why you `` honestly neither love nor hate Mar@@ mit@@ e because seriously guys it &apos;s just ye@@ ast extract HA@@ HA@@ H@@ A I &apos;ll be in my room . &apos;&apos;
take a breath .
and help others take one too - ask questions and show interest .
it ste@@ ers the conversation and helps you to sc@@ out out the people you like versus those you would n&apos;t talk to even if your ey@@ el@@ ashes were on fire and they were disp@@ ens@@ ing extingui@@ shers .
give people space .
people &apos;s rooms often mor@@ ph into drin@@ ks rec@@ eptions , movi@@ e-@@ night ven@@ ues and communal han@@ g@@ out spots , but they &apos;re also where people get dressed and adjust their under@@ wear .
related : do n&apos;t even think about starting university in a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts get a raw deal at university .
your room should be a retreat , yet many h@@ alls form an inter-@@ ro@@ om@@ -@@ st@@ rolling culture that &apos;s friendly , social and conducive to lifel@@ ong friend@@ ships .
that can be hell for someone who &apos;s trying to rech@@ ar@@ ge .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , `` I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I &apos;ve exp@@ ended on inter@@ acting with you . &apos;&apos;
try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ alis@@ ing - and maybe text instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
one guy in my student h@@ alls had a policy that if a door was n&apos;t locked he was invited in .
he saw some things .
make friends through b@@ aking .
since you &apos;re starting uni at the height of bak@@ e-@@ off mani@@ a , kno@@ cking on people &apos;s doors to introduce yourself with a plate of bro@@ w@@ ni@@ es seems margin@@ ally less wei@@ r@@ d , less 1950s `` welcome to the neigh@@ bour@@ hood , I bak@@ ed you something , now smile as I ask you personal questions . &apos;&apos;
offering hom@@ em@@ ade treats is a great way to make friends .
your hous@@ em@@ ates will feel obliged to ch@@ at , and may end up associ@@ ating your face with a ta@@ sty surprise .

ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student h@@ alls .

double check with the milk owner .
chances are they &apos;ll tell you to help yourself even if they &apos;re se@@ e@@ thing inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying and you have my sympath@@ ies - but try to deal with it more mat@@ urely than my hall@@ mate , who tainted her milk with w@@ as@@ hin@@ g-@@ up liquid to punish those who st@@ ole it .
she &apos;s in jail now .
you should n&apos;t make no@@ ise that keeps people from sle@@ eping or studying .
this is n&apos;t just to be a decent human , but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses .
a girl on my cor@@ ri@@ dor asked her neighbo@@ ur if they would n&apos;t mind turning down the dru@@ m and b@@ ass because it was 3@@ am and she had an ex@@ am in the morning .
they responded by turning it up .
when they finally shut up at 5@@ am , she kin@@ dly let them sleep for two hours before b@@ lasting her own music , locking her door as she left for her three-@@ hour ex@@ am .
would n&apos;t it be romantic if your future spo@@ use happened to move into the same hall as you ?
conversely , would n&apos;t it be k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le-@@ bit@@ ingly awkward if you mi@@ sto@@ ok a hall@@ mate for your future spo@@ use , ho@@ oked up , broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get custody of all your mutual friends ?
of course , the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hall@@ mate is definitely not your future spo@@ use , try to at least talk some sense into your gro@@ in .
in the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating moment you re@@ ali@@ se someone &apos;s left their keys inside their un@@ locked room , the line between p@@ ranking and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .

Ter@@ ra@@ ced houses for refugees , single parents , low earners
property entrep@@ rene@@ ur Mark@@ us Gil@@ dner is building ter@@ ra@@ ced houses in the Middle Fran@@ conian town of Eck@@ ental for people who do not have much money .
for example for refugees - but also as a sign : `` Not only refugees need accommodation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes . &apos;&apos;
`` I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays , &apos;&apos; says the 4@@ 4-@@ year-old in an interview .
thousands of refugees are pushing their way onto the housing market .
entrep@@ rene@@ ur Mar@@ cus Gil@@ dner believes he knows how quickly econom@@ ical housing can be developed : with this project he is building ter@@ ra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ dner , thousands of refugees are coming onto the housing market .
what solution are you offering ?
Mark@@ us Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in con@@ tain@@ ers and gy@@ ms is not sustainable .
because most of the people will be staying here .
we will also need sufficient housing space to accommodate the influx of refugees over the next decades .
a totally standard three-@@ stor@@ ey ter@@ ra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a ter@@ ra@@ ced house needs little space .
it facilitates integration .
it is different when the people are hous@@ ed in blocks of fl@@ ats .
each of the six houses which are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three living units each for four asylum seekers .
each living unit has two bedro@@ oms , one b@@ ath@@ room , one kit@@ chen and a lo@@ unge .
it &apos;s possible that many refugees will say ; now that peace has returned I &apos;m going back .
then the houses can easily be converted for different uses .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 m@@ ² of living space per house amounts to € 18@@ 4,000 without land .
that is manageable .
construction took six months .
that is reasonable .
did building regulations complicate your plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I carried out my project in accordance with building regulations .
the sword of Dam@@ oc@@ les threatening special building projects , and par@@ king space regulations , always make it complicated .
scary .
it is still assumed that anyone creating three fl@@ ats in a ter@@ ra@@ ced house needs at least three par@@ king places .
except that there is not enough space in towns .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how have residents reacted to your ter@@ ra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of building luxury accommodation for asylum seekers .
that is definitely not true .
but are n&apos;t you making the competition for affordable housing worse ?
Gil@@ dner : the truth is over the last five years we have had a building boom in Germany , but it is luxury accommodation that has been built , which hardly anybody can afford any longer .
my project gives the message that normal people need housing space too .
not only refugees need accommodation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes .
I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays .
this is what it is about .

`` Not in@@ frequently , too , many services provided by insurers are not used because the complexity of the insurance is so difficult to understand , &apos;&apos; the new manager , J@@ ut@@ ta W@@ eig@@ and , who as head of the services division for old people &apos;s welfare is also responsible for the Ant@@ on@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ spit@@ al as well as for `` Ama@@ de@@ us &apos;&apos; out@@ patient services , explained .
apart from advice , the new accommodation office also offers courses in prevention , health and well@@ ness .
Sal@@ u@@ dis has been taken on board for this .
as a result , additional off@@ er@@ ings such as prevention of falls , memory training or physi@@ other@@ ap@@ y treatment are also available .
the offers from the senior citizens centr@@ e and from Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis represents prevention , precau@@ tion , and rehabilitation .
`` The senior citizens &apos; centr@@ e for care and nursing , &apos;&apos; is how Hei@@ ke Ri@@ ed@@ el , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis describes it .
both managers see the reason behind the opening of the new accommodation office in the town centr@@ e as democratic chan@@ ge@@ ,
as this makes a good decentr@@ alis@@ ed infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg essential in the future .
furthermore , as Mayor Wolfgang M@@ etz@@ ner -LRB- SPD -RRB- under@@ lined at the opening ceremony , the accommodation office is also dedicated to dealing with the isolation of old people . `` There are numerous activities and offers on the programme and these extend inv@@ it@@ ations to regular social gather@@ ings . &apos;&apos;
thus the social foundation makes a big contribution towards making senior citizens as independent as possible and towards enabling them to live well in their familiar environment .

D@@ r Frank Müll@@ er takes over Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen practice and invests € 3@@ 10,000
Sy@@ l@@ via Müll@@ er-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müll@@ er -LRB- from left -RRB- take over practice from Kar@@ l-@@ H@@ ein@@ rich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen .
the mayor of the joint community , Bern@@ d Bor@@ mann , business spon@@ sor U@@ T@@ A Sei@@ m@@ -@@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ f &apos;s mayor H@@ ein@@ fri@@ ed Kab@@ bert are deli@@ ghted at this turn of events .
many areas in the country have no doctor - A@@ sen@@ dor@@ f by contrast is fortunate : on 1 October D@@ r Frank Müll@@ er is taking over the Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen practice .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen is reti@@ ring , her husband Kar@@ l-@@ H@@ ein@@ rich will spend the next few months working part-time with his successor .
D@@ r Müll@@ er re@@ opens the practice on 12 October after a period of ren@@ o@@ vation ; by then he will have invested € 3@@ 10,000 in the premises at St@@ .@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ stra@@ sse 6 .
when the Fel@@ steh@@ aus@@ ens met Frank Müll@@ er and his wife D@@ r Sil@@ via Müll@@ er-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who at the time were fini@@ shing their residen@@ cies in Ver@@ den hospital and also wanted to take on a practice in the next few years , they liked each other immediately
`` It was always in the back of our minds that the Müll@@ ers would fit into this practice well , &apos;&apos; says D@@ r Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen and lau@@ ghs .
`` When we were ready , I simply called them up . &apos;&apos;
the Müll@@ er couple liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dor@@ f in the future .
`` The proximity and the continuous contact with the patients are attractive to us , &apos;&apos; says 3@@ 9-@@ year-old Müll@@ er .
`` We want to get to know the families and support them over the years . &apos;&apos;
he also sees being his own boss as a benefit .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers would buy the house with the practice .
however in the meantime they are living in Bruch@@ haus@@ en-@@ Vil@@ sen .
father of two Frank Müll@@ er also grew up there and after his medical studies in Han@@ over he worked in a number of medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ en@@ burg und Rot@@ en@@ burg .
he is currently working as a consult@@ ant in Sul@@ ingen , furthermore he was appointed chief emergency doctor in the coun@@ ty of Di@@ ep@@ hol@@ z in 2009 and was involved on a voluntary basis in the blood donation service in Bruch@@ haus@@ en-@@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice will be preparing for the new boss .
while sur@@ ge@@ on D@@ r Kar@@ l-@@ H@@ ein@@ rich Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen worked as a general practition@@ er , his wife Ur@@ sel -LRB- a speci@@ alist in internal medicine -RRB- speci@@ alis@@ ed in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both specialists in internal medicine , wanted to establish themselves as general practitioners .
`` So it &apos;s out with the endo@@ sc@@ op@@ y , &apos;&apos; says 3@@ 8-@@ year-old Sy@@ l@@ via Müll@@ er-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultra@@ sound exam@@ in@@ ations as well as long-term and stress E@@ KG@@ s and we need one more consulting room .
the IT system will also be completely renewed .
the Müll@@ ers are receiving a grant tot@@ alling € 50,000 as part of a funding programme from the coun@@ ty -LRB- € 2,@@ 500 -RRB- as well as from the joint community -LRB- € 1@@ 2,@@ 500 -RRB- and the local authority -LRB- € 1@@ 2,@@ 500 -RRB- .
`` This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will carry on , &apos;&apos; stressed the mayor of the joint community Bern@@ d Bor@@ mann .
according to Sy@@ l@@ via Müll@@ er-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll , some 2,000 patients visit the Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen practice every quarter ; in north Germany the average practice sees about 500 .
there is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dor@@ f .
Frank Müll@@ er says that there is another side benefit of their taking over the practice : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen , the chemi@@ st will stay in A@@ sen@@ dor@@ f .
if they had n&apos;t found any successor , it would have closed down .
anyone visiting the Müll@@ ers &apos; surgery will also first of all see familiar faces : they are taking over the seven medical assi@@ stan@@ ts and the cleaner from the Fel@@ steh@@ aus@@ ens .
with their leaving , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dor@@ f ; after all the doctors have had their practice there for 30 years .
`` We started with only two rooms , &apos;&apos; re@@ members Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen with a gr@@ in .
after such a long time she feels a little wi@@ st@@ ful .
`` But we &apos;ll still be living in Hoh@@ en@@ mo@@ or and I &apos;m sure we will be seeing many of our patients often , &apos;&apos; says the internal medicine speci@@ alist .
her husband adds with a smile , `` We &apos;ve got a 6@@ 000 m@@ ² garden . &apos;&apos;
`` U@@ p to now I have n&apos;t done much gar@@ dening , that might change now . &apos;&apos;
the couple also have two grandchildren and enjoy trav@@ elling .
Croatia : `` We are letting the refugees through &apos;&apos;
`` B@@ order control is being brought in now on our southern border too , &apos;&apos; says Interior Minister Johann@@ a Mi@@ kl@@ -L@@ ei@@ tn@@ er .
in parallel , checks on the Hungarian border remain in place .
it is still a priority that anyone wanting to claim asylum can `` of course &apos;&apos; do so .
the care and safety of people is paramount .
it is equally clear `` that obvious signals are needed , &apos;&apos; says the minister .
people must know that we do not accept an unlimited flow of migration , and not over the Austri@@ an-@@ Sloven@@ ian border either .
a controlled procedure is required
Croatia is considering a `` cor@@ ri@@ dor &apos;&apos; - Slovenia has refused .
the Croati@@ an government had earlier announced that Slovenia also wanted to let incoming refugees travel through towards Austria and Germany , and also potentially establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , Interior Minister V@@ es@@ na G@@ y@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in L@@ ai@@ b@@ ach did not see it in quite the same light .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is `` absolutely unacceptable , &apos;&apos; Slov@@ ein@@ a intends rather to step up its surveillance of the borders - especially the border to Hungary .
the border with Croatia , as the external border to the Schengen area , is however already heavily controlled .
but as the Minister stressed , Slovenia is not suggesting se@@ aling its borders for refugees .
`` E@@ very member of the EU has to fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system can not work , &apos;&apos; stressed G@@ y@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
according to the Croati@@ an government , the first refugees attempted to enter Eastern Croatia on Mon@@ day night over the To@@ var@@ nik @/@ Si@@ d border crossing , in order to avoid registration .
the Croati@@ an police were able to pick them up in the nearby maize field .
since then , according to local media , police vehicles are constantly coming across new refugees in Croati@@ an T@@ av@@ ar@@ nik .
they are mostly Syrian and Afghans , among them many women and children .
the emergency se@@ vices and the Red Cro@@ ss are also already in place .
interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic says that his country is expecting around 4@@ 000 refugees in the next few days .
in addition it was reported by both Croati@@ an and Serbian media on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day that b@@ uses from Pre@@ se@@ vo on the Mac@@ ed@@ oni@@ an-@@ Serbian border , which have up to now taken migrants to the Hungarian border , are being diverted to Croatia
the government in Belgrade denied , however , that it is the case that they are giving people instructions to take certain routes . `` We neither can nor want to do that , &apos;&apos; they stated .
according to media reports , at least one bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d in the early hours , and in the course of the day more b@@ uses are expected .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the detainees were trav@@ elling the entire night through Serbia from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , about 500 kilom@@ et@@ res away .
`` We heard that Hungary is closed , so the police said we should come here , &apos;&apos; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to go through Croatia , Sloweni@@ a and Austria to get to Germany .
this implies that a shift in the former Balkan route through Turkey , Greece , Macedonia , Serbia and Hungary to a route somewhat further to the west , which observers have already predicted , could actually now be happening .
Croatia : `` widespread options for border control &apos;&apos;
Croati@@ an Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has already prepared appropriate plans for potential exceptional situations in the event of a large influx of refugees .
he gave no details , but he indicated that Croatia , as a non-@@ member of the Schengen Treaty , has `` widespread options for border control . &apos;&apos;
rigorous checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Sche@@ gen area .
Slovenia has been a member since 2007 , since when its EU partners have presented a consistently good report on the country as far as border controls are concerned .
there are also some 300 refugees stuck on the Serbian side behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to media reports from Belgrade , they spent the past night at the Hor@@ gos border crossing , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the Hungarian authorities claim that both the Hor@@ gos and the B@@ ack@@ i Bre@@ g border cro@@ s@@ sings also remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croati@@ an border is still not clear .
at a local appearance on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day morning , the Serbian Interior Minister , Ne@@ bo@@ j@@ sa St@@ ef@@ ano@@ vi@@ c , tried to reassure people : he considers the debate on the refugees &apos; alternative routes after the closure of the Hungarian border to be premature .
at the moment there is not a large number of refugees involved .
it is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
aid workers advi@@ se migrants to take - dangerous - alternative routes .
but private Hungarian aid workers have already started to distribute ma@@ ps marked with alternative routes through Croatia to refugees
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is however not without danger : in parts of the border region , even 20 years after the end of the Croati@@ an war , there are still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day after@@ no@@ on the Croati@@ an police announced that a team of min@@ es@@ we@@ epers has been sent to the border region .
stock exchange hack@@ er : Ukrainians pay $ 30 million

the information provided enabled insider dealing on the financial markets .
by this means , according to investigators , a total of over $ 100 million was sc@@ am@@ med .
`` current information indicates that even those outside our national borders have finally been caught , &apos;&apos; an SEC report states .

`` It &apos;s about life , which is why we are carrying out this campaign in the middle of the town , right among the people , &apos;&apos; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer .
the head of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice C@@ are is also available to answer questions from and have discussions with pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by , as are voluntary workers .

again and again little discussions develop in cor@@ ners about the campaign itself , about life , about dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also there now .
`` It &apos;s only when I consider that some day the end of this world is going to come for me that I can live responsibly , &apos;&apos; says the Director of the Protestant social charity Di@@ ak@@ onischen Werk in Mann@@ hei@@ m , which is a responsible body along with the Car@@ it@@ as Association for E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice C@@ are .
which is why these high vi@@ sibility campaigns are good for the 20-@@ year-old organisation .
of course it &apos;s understandable that not everyone wants to share their message publicly on the black@@ boards ; in the end it &apos;s a very personal matter .
the topics of life and death are still steep@@ ed in tabo@@ os , according to Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer &apos;s experience , although the hosp@@ ice movement even over the last few years has done much to help people to accept it .

having been confronted with personal experiences of these issues she read a lot of literature and decided she wanted to get involved in helping people who are dying .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice C@@ are organisation appealed for volunte@@ er help@@ ers , she signed up immediately and was with them when they started up in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who help those people affected and their relatives in private households , hospitals , care homes and in the S@@ ankt V@@ inc@@ ent hosp@@ ice .

Fe@@ dex earnings mixed , lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
Fe@@ dex reported disappointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its full-@@ year profit forecast on weaker demand for frei@@ ght services and higher costs in its ground division .
the company also said it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seas@@ onal workers for the holi@@ days .
at this time last year , Fe@@ dex announced it would hire 50,000 seas@@ onal workers for the holi@@ days .
its shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes ahead of W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day &apos;s opening b@@ ell .
Fe@@ dex Cor@@ p@@ . said that it expects to earn between $ 1@@ 0.@@ 40 and $ 1@@ 0.@@ 90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 cents from an earlier prediction .
analysts expected $ 1@@ 0.@@ 84 , according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ S@@ et .
the reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes averaging 4.@@ 9 percent , which will take effect Jan@@ . 4 , and higher sur@@ charges for ground shi@@ pment of heavy or large packages , which begin in November .
the company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-@@ cutting , higher revenue and growth in online commerce .
Chairman and CEO F@@ red Smith said the company was `` performing soli@@ dly given weak@@ er-@@ th@@ an-@@ expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &apos;&apos;
the holi@@ da@@ y-@@ hiring plans were announced a day after rival U@@ PS said that that it plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same that it hired last year .
in the quarter that ended Au@@ g. 31 , Fe@@ dex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 , short of the $ 2.@@ 44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surve@@ yed by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
revenue rose 5 percent , to $ 1@@ 2.3 billion .
six analysts surve@@ yed by Z@@ acks expected $ 1@@ 2.@@ 23 billion .
Fe@@ dex has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping , which has caused revenue in its Ex@@ press unit to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has boosted results at Fe@@ dex Gro@@ und .
in the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-@@ insurance .
the express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the frei@@ ght business on higher labor costs .
in pre@@ market trading about an hour before the opening b@@ ell , Fe@@ dex shares were down $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
they closed Tu@@ es@@ day down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most anticipated meeting in years , Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 2@@ 7-@@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table deciding if it &apos;s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
looming over them at one end of the central bank &apos;s or@@ n@@ ate , two-@@ story bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om will be a m@@ ural of the United States .
the map is a reminder that Fed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L@@ . Y@@ ellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation &apos;s economic interests above all others .
the central bank has a dual charge from Congress : maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable .
but since the Great Recession , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there &apos;s an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and that third mandate could be the X-@@ factor in a too-@@ clo@@ se-@@ to-@@ predict decision , to be announced Th@@ urs@@ day , about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being we@@ aned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-@@ zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
even though most data show the economy growing soli@@ dly , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-@@ cautious Fed officials sk@@ it@@ tish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point .
`` Ob@@ viously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch , &apos;&apos; said Lin@@ dse@@ y M. P@@ ie@@ g@@ za , chief economist at brok@@ er@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; C@@ o .
`` But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further , &apos;&apos; she said .
there &apos;s no consensus about what the Fed will do , which in itself is causing financial market j@@ it@@ ters .
about half of economists surve@@ yed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week .
financial markets , however , are expecting the Fed to hold off , with a key indicator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate , unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
on Tu@@ es@@ day , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 2@@ 2@@ 8.@@ 89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16@@ ,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week , said John L@@ on@@ ski , chief economist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
`` It would be a surprise if the Fed hi@@ ked rates at this point in time , &apos;&apos; he said .
if Fed policymakers did , `` they would have to go to great leng@@ ths in their policy statement to hold financial markets &apos; hands so they do n&apos;t panic . &apos;&apos;
other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act .
just a month ago , the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would vali@@ date the strength of the U.S. recovery .
Y@@ ellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed .
although job creation slowed in August , labor market growth has been solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment .
wage gains have shown signs of picking up .
and although inflation continued to run below the central bank &apos;s annual 2 % target , Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices .
the economy `` can cope with higher rates , and needs them , given the tigh@@ tness of the labor market , &apos;&apos; said I@@ an S@@ he@@ pher@@ d@@ son , chief economist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but financial markets around the world started con@@ vul@@ sing late last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth .
the market has rebo@@ unded somewhat this month , with the Dow now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
for Fed policymakers , the market turmoil adds to the complex calculus of when to raise the interest rate .
`` absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tightening at this meeting , &apos;&apos; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , a senior research fellow at the UC@@ L@@ A Z@@ im@@ an Center for Real E@@ state and a former Fed official .
now , he predicts they &apos;ll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
`` There &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post-@@ dates the developments in China , &apos;&apos; O@@ liner said .
the health of the global economy is n&apos;t one of the Fed &apos;s primary concerns , so technically it should n&apos;t be fac@@ tor@@ ed into its decision-making .
but , in effect , the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
the central bank &apos;s influence in recent years has been enormous .
the mere hint by then-@@ Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might `` tap@@ er &apos;&apos; its monetary expansion triggered market con@@ vul@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
its decision-making process is `` more art than science , &apos;&apos; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , head of global strategy for wealth@@ -@@ management firm En@@ vest@@ net In@@ c .
Jeffrey L@@ ack@@ er , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , va . , noted this month that `` the Fed has a history of over@@ reacting to financial market movements that seem un@@ connected to economic fundamentals . &apos;&apos;
L@@ ack@@ er , a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , cited decisions in 1998-@@ 99 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage point over three meetings `` despite limited identi@@ fiable implications for U.S. growth , &apos;&apos; L@@ ack@@ er said .
a year later , Fed officials reversed those cuts .
the Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market meltdown , said Adam S. Po@@ sen , a former member of the Bank of England &apos;s rate@@ -@@ setting committee .
the latest turmoil does n&apos;t come close to that level , he said .
`` You certainly do n&apos;t want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset , &apos;&apos; said Po@@ sen , president of the Pe@@ ter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do n&apos;t think they should get ahead of the curve .

Ho@@ y@@ er@@ s@@ wer@@ da : a bit of help for refugees
these days more and more refugees are arriving in Germany .
to prepare a warm welcome for them is not just a matter of the commitment of countless voluntary help@@ ers .
in Ho@@ y@@ er@@ s@@ wer@@ da there is also a whole range of people who un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly support asylum seekers in the town .
among these are Pet@@ ra und Klaus H@@ eine .
Pet@@ ra H@@ eine is a dedicated teacher .
even at 74 she still lo@@ ves teaching .
every Th@@ urs@@ day she goes to the refugee centr@@ e on D@@ ill@@ inger Stra@@ sse .

of course these lessons are very different from those at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atri@@ c Society of Rio Gran@@ de promotes healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding di@@ ets
Brazilian pedi@@ atri@@ c organization S@@ PR@@ S has come up with a shocking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while bre@@ ast@@ feeding , by feat@@ uring images of babies su@@ ck@@ ling from bre@@ asts painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy food .
human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins , fats , vit@@ am@@ ins , and carb@@ oh@@ yd@@ rates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to grow a strong immune system .
due to excess energy requirements , pregnant women and new mom@@ s are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie in@@ take by about 500 cal@@ ories per day .
however , new research suggests that increasing cal@@ orie in@@ take is not the only di@@ etary adjustment mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , a professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medic@@ ine in Texas revealed that healthy di@@ ets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors .
unfortunately , unhealthy di@@ ets were found to negatively affect the child &apos;s immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
Bern@@ ried district council has approved the planning application for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and it is making an exception .
the ro@@ of may be flat@@ ter to accommodate a solar energy system .
planning for the long-@@ awaited sports building on the Bern@@ ried sports ground are moving ahead step by step : in the latest council meeting the planning application was approved unanimously without any great discussion .
the committee had earlier agreed , among other things , to an `` exception , &apos;&apos; or rather an `` exemp@@ tion &apos;&apos; under building law to the applicable building plan .
the `` exception &apos;&apos; refers to permission for a special shape for the ro@@ of structure .
according to this a `` g@@ able ro@@ of with an off-@@ centr@@ e ri@@ dge and ro@@ of overhang &apos;&apos; will be constructed .
the background for the plan is the planned use of the ro@@ of surface for solar panels . `` This means we will have a wonder@@ fully large sou@@ th-@@ facing ro@@ of , &apos;&apos; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
the `` exemp@@ tion &apos;&apos; on the other hand refers to the ro@@ of pit@@ ch , which for energy reasons - contrary to the stipul@@ ations in the development plan - will be less than 10 degrees .
this will reduce the volume of the hall .
therefore an `` exemp@@ tion &apos;&apos; is necessary , since the development plan allows no `` exceptions &apos;&apos; with regard to ro@@ of pit@@ ch - while the Bern@@ ried council as a rule has a more restrictive approach to requests for exemp@@ tions .
the sports hall is however more of a recurring project . `` We are not setting a precedent with this , &apos;&apos; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the hall at the sports centr@@ e is a joint project between the district and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs have been calculated at around € 2.3 million .
contributions are expected through funding from schools and popular sports .
in the next step of the project , the planning application for the 18 x 36 met@@ re hall will be presented to the district administration for review .
P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg clin@@ ic moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg Ho@@ spit@@ al is closing earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time D@@ r Wilhelm Fischer -LRB- 66 -RRB- will become the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Ho@@ spit@@ al .
the wards and the majority of employees are moving to Sch@@ ong@@ au from P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg .
this allows for the district &apos;s limited company hospital &apos;s surprising plans , confirms district administ@@ rator Andre@@ a Jo@@ ch@@ ner@@ -@@ Wei@@ ss .
the Board of directors , however , will come to a decision about this and they meet next W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day , 23 September .
if these plans are implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg will remain in employment .
the vast majority will move with Fischer and the internal medicine ward that still continues to exist to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the premises are available .
those employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered positions in Wei@@ l@@ hei@@ m , according to Jo@@ ch@@ ner@@ -@@ Wei@@ ss .
employees have been informed about the plans .
the changes were triggered by the resignation of D@@ r Andre@@ as E@@ der , who has been clinical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clin@@ ic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vic@@ in@@ ity of the hospital .
when the question of who his successor should be , according to Jo@@ ch@@ ner@@ -@@ Wei@@ ss , the name of `` Fischer , &apos;&apos; who had declared that he was prepared to take over leadership from 1 October and move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au , was raised .
for the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital , these changes mean an `` up@@ grade &apos;&apos; and an expansion of the services offered in the field of internal medicine , says Jo@@ ch@@ ner@@ -@@ Wei@@ ss .
Fisher is a speci@@ alist in car@@ di@@ ac pac@@ em@@ akers and defi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au -LRB- 180 be@@ ds -RRB- speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological disorders in its internal medicine department .
in the transi@@ tionary period over the next two years Fischer and his team , if the Board of Management agrees to this , will run both establi@@ shments , and in the next year the former min@@ ers &apos; hospital in P@@ ei@@ ssen@@ berg , which still has over 35 be@@ ds , will finally be closed after almost 140 years .
thus far the district has planned this for 201@@ 8 , when the currently ongoing restoration of the Wei@@ l@@ hei@@ m hospital is finished .
district administ@@ rator Jo@@ ch@@ ner@@ -@@ Wei@@ ss , who is also Chairman of the Board of Management , contradicts ru@@ mo@@ urs that the building , which is owned by the Federal Association for min@@ ers , will in the future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
`` I can rule that out . &apos;&apos; What will happen to the building , Jo@@ ch@@ ner@@ -@@ Wei@@ ss can not say ; that needs more consideration .
at the moment a Car@@ it@@ as short-term care facility and a da@@ y@@ time psychiatric facility are hous@@ ed there .
`` It &apos;s the best thing that could have happened for us ; we wo n&apos;t get this sort of opportunity again , &apos;&apos; says Fischer about the move to the Lech , which has been accepted `` positively and with understanding &apos;&apos; by employees .
real prospects for the building where Fischer has worked for over 30 years as chief physician do not really exist .
he was asked by his colleagues at Sch@@ ong@@ au to take over the post of medical director .
the Pi@@ essen@@ berg hospital , which once had 100 be@@ ds , has been constantly under threat of closure over the last decades . departments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ etri@@ cs .

Six@@ te@@ en-@@ year-old missing from R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine since Satur@@ day is the victim of a violent crime .
the body of a young woman was found on Tu@@ es@@ day evening in Rock@@ en@@ hau@@ sen near Kais@@ er@@ slau@@ tern the public prosecutor &apos;s office and police reported on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
a 20-@@ year-old suspect , who conf@@ essed to the crime and led investigators to the site where the body was found , was arrested also on Tu@@ es@@ day evening .
the 16@@ -year-old was reported as missing Sunday morning when she did not return home as agreed after attending an autumn party in Rock@@ en@@ hau@@ sen .
in their search for the young woman , investigators initially found personal items belonging to the victim .
interviews with the missing girl &apos;s circle of friends and acqu@@ ain@@ t@@ ances ultimately resulted in 20-@@ year-old becoming a suspect .
the presumed perpet@@ rator then led the police to a can@@ al in Rock@@ en@@ hau@@ sen , where the body was found .
under interrogation the arrested man conf@@ essed the police that he had killed the 16@@ -year-old and thrown her body in the can@@ al .
the 20-@@ year-old will be brought before the magi@@ strate on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day ; investigators have reduced the charge to one of man@@ slaughter .

refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is tense
and more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the struggle for allocations in the German housing market began long ago .
with the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are crowding into a market which in many large towns is already overb@@ ur@@ dened .
they are competing with residents on low incomes for the last affordable homes .
to supply the demand for affordable homes , 400,000 new units must be built every year up to 2020 .
this is the conclusion reached by a study commissioned by the `` Social H@@ ous@@ ing &apos;&apos; federation of associations .
in comparison , 2@@ 60,000 units were completed in this year in Germany .
this amounts to a shortfall of 14@@ 0,000 homes .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in initial rec@@ eption accommodation .
many then push onto the housing market and stand in long qu@@ eu@@ es in front of r@@ ental fl@@ ats .
according to the German Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , in the last year fewer than half of all asylum seekers have lived as ten@@ ants .
the negative development in the housing market , however , is not just due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
the study points to significant failings in housing policy over the last year .
Germany has a housing deficit which increases every year .
there is a current shortfall in urban areas of around 7@@ 7@@ 0,000 living units lam@@ ents Mat@@ thi@@ as Gün@@ ther , author of the study .
this is why many professionals in large towns are forced to live in flat shares .
due to the slump in the housing market , young adults of necessity live longer in `` Hotel M@@ ama . &apos;&apos;
in large towns over the last few years , the number of square met@@ res per head has decreased for the first time .
in order to solve the problem , the `` Social H@@ ous@@ ing &apos;&apos; alliance suggests a fresh start .
new incentives should revive social housing .
for example land transfer tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for sponsored housing temporarily suspended .
in addition , according to the association , attractive tax depreciation possibilities are necessary .
the K@@ f@@ W state bank &apos;s refugee funding programme has already been well received in towns and local authorities .
on Mon@@ day evening , a good week after start of the programme , € 18@@ 4 million - more than half of the around € 300 million which had been made available - had already been requested .
the project may now even be stepped up .
refugees have safe conduct : Croatia and Slovenia put cor@@ ri@@ dor in place
since Hungary has virtually stopped letting them through , the choice of more and more refugees is the route over Croatia .
Z@@ agre@@ b has announced that they will allow passage over Slovenia towards the north without obstacles .
however the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to come to an agreement with neighbo@@ uring Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ ri@@ dor for refugees .
`` I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian Minister for the Interior , and if necessary we will organi@@ se a cor@@ ri@@ dor , &apos;&apos; said Croati@@ an Minister for the Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone .
EU member Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the se@@ aling off of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees set out for Croatia in order to reach West Europe from there .
five hundred people came over the border at To@@ var@@ nik , reports Croati@@ an television station R@@ T@@ L .
Hungary had c@@ ord@@ oned off its borders for refugees the previous day .
moreover , new laws which came into force on the same day make fair asylum proceedings in Hungary practically redundant .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through .
the Croati@@ an Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vi@@ c explains , `` They may pass through and we are preparing ourselves for this possibility . &apos;&apos;
these people are there , they are women children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
they are however people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croati@@ an police picked up the first refugees on the Serbian border to EU neighbo@@ ur Croatia in the morning .
according to media reports most come from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived at the Serbian border town of Si@@ d both by bus and in tax@@ is .
immediately after their arrival they tried to reach the green border to Croatia on foot .
at the Croati@@ an-@@ Serbian border the refugees did not come across border f@@ ences .
the border stri@@ ps hold other dangers : there are still active mines there from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 9@@ 0s .
it is now planned for min@@ es@@ we@@ epers to quickly create a safe passage .
meanwhile after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tu@@ es@@ day police counted 3@@ 66 people that they had picked up .
shortly before the closing of the gate on Mon@@ day the number was 9,@@ 3@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy clim@@ bing and damaging the border f@@ ences as criminal off@@ ences .
this has led to 35 criminal proceedings being initiated in the South Hungarian border town of S@@ ze@@ ged .
those convicted are threatened with sentences of up to five years and ex@@ tradition from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications was accepted in the new `` transition zone &apos;&apos; set up at the border , almost all - 93 - at the biggest crossing at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applic@@ ants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day morning another 40 refugees were stopped there .
in practice , however , nobody else has a chance of being granted asylum in Hungary .
according to opinion in Hungary , Serbia is `` a safe third country . &apos;&apos;
the rejected asylum seekers will be depor@@ ted there .
only a few hundred refugees now are gathering by `` the transition zone &apos;&apos; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers have begun to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they are collecting the rub@@ bi@@ sh that tens of thousands of people have left lying at the sides of the roads over the last weeks .
crowd barriers are being dismantled and one of the rec@@ eption cent@@ res in the border town is being rebuilt .
no one wants to talk about the goal of this rebuilding .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is getting only a few refugees .
furthermore the country has strengthened its border controls .
according to the go@@ ver@@ ment , around 20,000 migrants are still in the country .
in Sal@@ z@@ burg , some 1,@@ 400 people are waiting to travel on to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing one regularly meets small groups of refugees on foot .
mayor drives `` str@@ anded people &apos;&apos; over the border
`` We were busy cleaning up after the Bri@@ dge Fes@@ tiv@@ al on Sunday , when suddenly there were ten people standing at the entrance to the tent with su@@ it@@ cases , &apos;&apos; says Mayor of W@@ ern@@ stein A@@ lo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists who wanted to get to Pass@@ au by train .
because Germany had unexpectedly stopped train services to Austria on Sunday due to the influx of refugees , their journey had come to a halt in W@@ ern@@ stein , &apos;&apos; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and together with two other help@@ ers and their cars ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the str@@ anded people over the border to Pass@@ au .
before that we enter@@ tained our surprise gu@@ ests with sn@@ acks and drin@@ ks .
we said at once that we would take them to Pass@@ au by car .
`` It was a matter of course for us , &apos;&apos; says Stad@@ ler , talking to O@@ Ö@@ N .
they were very grateful .
one man insisted on handing over a generous donation - € 100 for the fire brig@@ ade .
`` We were very pleased about that , &apos;&apos; says Stad@@ ler .
the str@@ anded train passengers had changed trains in W@@ els on Sunday evening from an IC@@ E train to a regional train to Pass@@ au after the surprise announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended , in an attempt to cross the border anyway .
but the regional train was stopped before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am In@@ n .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , ex@@ cur@@ sions over the border are generally very popular .
the Bri@@ dge Fes@@ tiv@@ al is a joint effort between W@@ ern@@ stein and Bav@@ arians from Neu@@ kir@@ chen ; the Bri@@ dge Fes@@ tiv@@ al Association organis@@ es the social event on Sunday and an athle@@ tic two bridge walk the day before with their Bav@@ arian neighbo@@ urs .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending us tens of thousands more is a logical result of his hypocritical policies :
instead of providing immediate help to the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp by constructing structures which ensure a level of humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the Hungarian government &apos;s stance closer to an atmosphere of national socialism .
it is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas who are victims of the policy .
those who have fled , too , must notice that the `` promised land &apos;&apos; which had invited and welcomed them is not considered another refugee camp .
it will be a huge challenge , in the light of the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , to create humane conditions for asylum seekers .
there is a still greater one - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad is looking for w@@ inter-@@ proof accommodation for 3@@ 5,000
Konrad has his hands full with the hosting of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word carries weight .
the government has engaged the former powerful R@@ ai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen banker to establish accommodation for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got to gri@@ ps with the chaos in the T@@ rais@@ kir@@ chen rec@@ eption centr@@ e .
`` We no longer have any homeless people in T@@ rais@@ kir@@ chen , &apos;&apos; he reported on his first achievement .
and the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Mon@@ day happened without any great f@@ uss , said Konrad , prais@@ ing the organis@@ ational `` master@@ piece . &apos;&apos;
the Minister of the Interior , however , talked of a `` critical situation . &apos;&apos;
in total , Konrad estimates that accommodation for 8@@ 5,000 will be required in the current year .
in order to meet this figure , accommodation for another 3@@ 5,000 must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 to be provided for by the states and 15,000 by the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can manage .
`` But it is not a bottom@@ less pit , &apos;&apos; says Konrad .
he has already carried out talks with the State Govern@@ ors .
they have assured him that accommodation will also be found for the next refugees to arrive .
`` It is going well in Austria , &apos;&apos; says fer@@ ry M@@ ai@@ er .
the former VP mand@@ at@@ ary is assisting Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christop@@ h Schön@@ born , in which it will be confirmed how the Church will help .
the asylum coordin@@ ator has also got high expectations of the OR@@ F `` Hel@@ p the way we are &apos;&apos; campaign .
private individuals can offer simple accommodation over this platform .
it is also hoped that this will include hotels , which are often empty in winter .
Konrad and M@@ ai@@ er yesterday criti@@ si@@ sed the specific@@ ations for accommodation as `` too high . &apos;&apos;
in times of need it should not be necessary for those providing accommodation to have to comply with certain heights for to@@ w@@ el ra@@ ils or si@@ zes of sky@@ lights .
`` Emer@@ gency standards &apos;&apos; should apply for a limited period .
Konrad uses his experience as justification for why he , in contrast to the Ministry for the Interior , should be successful with the accommodation .
I am an older man , and nobody readily tells un@@ truths to my face
his most important weapon is the power of persuasion .
Konrad and M@@ ai@@ er are not costing the Republic anything , as they themselves explain .
the want to raise the number of their staff from three to four .
their own search for accommodation has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a con@@ tain@@ er on Step@@ han@@ sp@@ lat@@ z as an office .
but apparently there are problems with obtaining approval .
Lin@@ z demanding a better allocation
for the time being the city of Lin@@ z is not planning to open new sports h@@ alls and other buildings such as the T@@ IPS arena or the design Centre as accommodation for refugees .
at the moment this should not be necess@@ s@@ ary , as the people in question can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger -LRB- SP -RRB- .
but in case of emergency further locations need to be checked for their su@@ itability .
the town chief is critici@@ sing the allocation of refugees within the federal states .
other districts should also make their own contributions .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : `` Bor@@ ders will not be c@@ ord@@ oned off &apos;&apos;
in a long telephone call with Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Hor@@ st Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er -LRB- CSU -RRB- , State Governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger -LRB- VP -RRB- on Mon@@ day agreed to further action on the issue of refugees .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be c@@ ord@@ oned off .
the on@@ ward journey of refugees into the Federal Republic continues to be possible .
however appropriate border controls do now exist .
there will now no longer be any special trains with refugees trav@@ elling to Germany .
those seeking protection will however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
P@@ ühr@@ inger once more called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states .
the fact that Austria is also now reintro@@ duc@@ ing controls at its borders is for P@@ ühr@@ inger `` a logical consequence &apos;&apos; of Germany &apos;s approach .

J@@ ut@@ ta Br@@ eit actually wanted to get a dog .
the 4@@ 9-@@ year-old propri@@ et@@ or of L@@ IA Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt ar@@ c@@ ade had to un@@ ceremoni@@ ously postpone this plan : now she has finally expanded by taking on new premises
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business where she sells among other things b@@ ags , cases , shoes and gar@@ ments from different manufacturers , everything now revol@@ ves around Fur@@ la women &apos;s hand@@ b@@ ags ; pur@@ ses can be obtained starting at € 75 .
larger b@@ ags and acc@@ ess@@ ories cost up to € 500 .
the new shop opened yesterday .
it has been converted over the last few weeks .
`` I have been considering for a long time whether I should open another shop , &apos;&apos; says Br@@ eit .
crucial for this decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la manufacturers , who are based in B@@ olo@@ gn@@ a , were impressed with the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ b@@ ags are sold .
`` We are the only people in the greater Lin@@ tz area who sell this brand , &apos;&apos; said the mother of two daughters , who herself has Italian roots .
Br@@ eit got her interest in fashion from her mother , when she was still in the cra@@ dle .
it suits me best if something emerges and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
the expert can with absolute certainty give me the answer to the question of why so many women go into rap@@ tures at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag .
perhaps it &apos;s because a beautiful hand@@ bag can enhance any out@@ fit .
the bra@@ gg@@ art from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ ine ancestors of Donald trump came from a place whose inhabitants are known as bra@@ gg@@ arts .
this characteristic also connec@@ ts many with the billion@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald trump -LRB- 69 -RRB- is always the source of controversy .
whether he is expressing xenophobic opinions , being ru@@ de to journalists or revealing gaps in knowledge on crisis politics , the US presidential candidate creates a stir in the election campaign .
and comes out of it well .
this is also something that happens in the Pal@@ at@@ ine town of K@@ all@@ stadt , from where the property billion@@ aire &apos;s grand@@ parents origin@@ ate .
the New Yorker with the b@@ low-@@ dry hair@@ style is a concept to many in the win@@ em@@ aking village on the w@@ ine route .
many in the village of 1,@@ 200 inhabitants are related to him .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ ine : Donald trump , here in election campaign mode .
Sim@@ one W@@ end@@ el , a re@@ sident of K@@ all@@ stadt , has made a film about trump .
and what do the inhabitants of the village think about his ambition to become the most powerful man in the world ?
`` I think they find it rather exciting , but also in the way of K@@ all@@ stadt people they are not deeply impressed .
the native of K@@ all@@ stadt has made an am@@ using documentary film about the place and its famous off@@ shoots , included in whom besides trump are also the H@@ ein@@ z ket@@ ch@@ up family .
trump , who is not known for his modest@@ y , also gets a chance to speak in `` K@@ ings of K@@ all@@ stadt &apos;&apos; -LRB- 2014 -RRB- - with a statement that he would have been successful anyway , even had he lived in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not won over the people there .
there is indeed a certain respect for his family &apos;s achievements , but there also tends to be a view that trump `` is a bit of a bi@@ g@@ mouth , &apos;&apos; says W@@ end@@ el .
coinci@@ dentally , K@@ all@@ stadt &apos;s ni@@ ck@@ name in the region is , `` Die Bru@@ ll@@ j@@ es@@ macher , &apos;&apos; a dial@@ ect term which translates as `` The Bra@@ gg@@ art , &apos;&apos; she says .
trump comes from the village of the bra@@ gg@@ arts .
the story of the trump@@ s &apos; success began in 18@@ 85 when the man who would become Donald trump &apos;s grand@@ father emigr@@ ated and opened a s@@ alo@@ on for gold prospec@@ tors in the USA .
the foundation stone for his property business was his first purchase of land in New York .
but his grand@@ parents &apos; lives were not free of tragedy : their wish to return permanently to their home country collapsed in the Bav@@ arian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ ine then belonged .
they would not let trump enter as he had originally left without author@@ is@@ ation , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate History and Cultural anthropo@@ logy , R@@ ol@@ and Paul , explains at the beginning of the film .
trump is the grand@@ son of `` illegal emi@@ grants . &apos;&apos;
this is at odds with the sometimes pi@@ thy statements of his desc@@ endant .
he has repeatedly spoken in der@@ og@@ atory terms about Mexican immigrants in the US , and demanded the building of a border wall in order to deter illegal immigrants .
`` The f@@ uss he makes about it is not very nice , &apos;&apos; says H@@ ans@@ -@@ Jo@@ ach@@ im B@@ ender , a distant relative of trump -LRB- `` My grand@@ mother was born a trump , my grand@@ father was born a H@@ ein@@ z &apos;&apos; -RRB- .
the retired win@@ em@@ aker sees the American as rather alo@@ of , `` he always has a short f@@ use . &apos;&apos;
does he think trump will come ?
`` I ca n&apos;t imagine it , &apos;&apos; says the 7@@ 2-@@ year-old .
`` He has never had any interest in K@@ all@@ stadt . &apos;&apos;
guest house land@@ la@@ dy Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ram@@ m , like many of K@@ all@@ stadt &apos;s inhabitants , men@@ tions that descendants of the H@@ ein@@ z family made a donation towards the church organ when they visited , which was very well received .
`` I ca n&apos;t imagine Donald doing that , &apos;&apos; says the 6@@ 8-@@ year-old .
she would prefer it if he does n&apos;t win the election as `` he has such radical opinions , I do n&apos;t know whether it would be a good thing . &apos;&apos;
if anyone like him had been in charge in his grand@@ father &apos;s time , `` he would never have gone there . &apos;&apos;
`` There are more interesting topics than him , &apos;&apos; says win@@ em@@ aker &apos;s daughter Sarah B@@ üh@@ ler .
and as president ?
`` He &apos;s certainly not my president , &apos;&apos; she says .
and , `` the gra@@ pes will ri@@ pen without President trump . &apos;&apos;
W@@ end@@ el &apos;s film , for which trump gave a lengthy interview , has been seen by 12@@ ,000 cin@@ em@@ a-@@ go@@ ers , and interest is also growing in the USA .

J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options of where to begin his N@@ F@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making inqui@@ ries after his impressive open training day late last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 4@@ 9@@ ers and co@@ ach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it &apos;s looking like a wise decision .
some co@@ aches would have ben@@ ched Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game for losing a f@@ um@@ ble like the Aus@@ sie ru@@ g@@ by league convert did on his first p@@ unt return in Tu@@ es@@ day &apos;s 20-@@ 3 win against M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a showed faith in his man , giving Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return a p@@ unt and including him in the running game after an injury to Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true c@@ olo@@ urs in the lock@@ er room after the game .
instead of che@@ wing out his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also backed Hay@@ ne publicly in his post-@@ match press conference .
4@@ 9@@ ers beat repor@@ ter C@@ am In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne also received encouragement from special teams co-@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play .
J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne f@@ um@@ bles a p@@ unt that was recovered by the M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings during the first quarter
it was certainly not the start Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his N@@ F@@ L de@@ but .

because of the large number of refugees , the Frei@@ e Wähler are calling for 1000 new teachers in Bav@@ aria .
at the start of the F@@ W autumn conc@@ la@@ ve , party and faction leader Hu@@ bert A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger issued a warning about a severe crisis in Bav@@ aria &apos;s schools if there are not sufficient new teachers for the many new school@@ children : `` We need at least 1000 additional teachers to stop the schools from collapsing , &apos;&apos; said A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger .
`` O@@ ther@@ wise we will have upheavals in the Bav@@ arian education system . &apos;&apos;
the Frei@@ e Wähler faction is in session in the Lo@@ wer Fran@@ conian community until Fri@@ day .
very different main topics were originally planned .
but the record number of refugees is domin@@ ating the Frei@@ e Wähler meeting too .
`` Of course the subject of asylum is the main issue at the conc@@ la@@ ve , &apos;&apos; says A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger .
A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger is demanding the establishment of a UN safety zone in Syria , similar to the one during the Yugosla@@ vian war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
`` It ca n&apos;t go on like this , we have to get to the causes , &apos;&apos; says the Frei@@ e Wähler head .
the Frei@@ e Wähler want to de@@ port failed asylum seekers as quickly as possible .
for this reason , A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger also wants more personnel for the ad@@ min@@ st@@ rative courts , which are responsible for asylum cases : `` We need at least 50 new asylum judges as well , &apos;&apos; says A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger .
the F@@ W head critici@@ sed the lack of consistency between several federal states : `` We need unified standards in the Federal states nationwide . &apos;&apos;
`` Bav@@ aria de@@ ports ; others do n&apos;t . &apos;&apos;
`` We must be more efficient . &apos;&apos;
however , regional politics in Gro@@ ss@@ wahl@@ stadt should not be allowed to suffer .
an issue that has been running for many years remains on the agenda : educational policy .
in the new school year the Education Minister , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le -LRB- CDU -RRB- , started a `` middle school plus &apos;&apos; pilot project , in which an extension of the middle level in gra@@ mm@@ ars schools from three to four years is being tested - this will result in a return to taking nine years up to the university entry quali@@ fication ex@@ am .
but that is not enough for A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger .
`` The G@@ 9 issue must be spe@@ eded up , &apos;&apos; says the F@@ W head .
we demand freedom of choice for all gra@@ m@@ mar schools that want it .
a free move to G@@ 9 everywhere it is wanted .

discussion about the impact due to the ph@@ asing out of nuclear energy has meanwhile pushed R@@ W@@ E stocks to an all time low and also left a significant mark on E@@ on .

in the view of one trader , a positive report by US investment magazine `` Bar@@ ron &apos;s &apos;&apos; at the weekend continues to have an effect .

4 killed After Poli@@ ce F@@ ire rub@@ ber bullets at protesters in Nepal
four people , including a 4-@@ year-old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rub@@ ber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country &apos;s proposed new constitution , an official said on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
the violence occurred Tu@@ es@@ day evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 17@@ 5 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u , the capital .
Bi@@ sh@@ nu Pra@@ sad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr. D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police used te@@ ar gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rub@@ ber bullets .
twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why rub@@ ber bullets , which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-@@ lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death toll .
the clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal &apos;s southern pla@@ ins , where members of the Mad@@ he@@ si ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would di@@ lu@@ te their political influence .
there have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clashes since Au@@ g .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal , which has been centr@@ ally governed for centuries .
work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
lawmakers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u this week , and officials have said that the new charter could be enacted by Sunday .

investors have presented their plans for the project to the public .
a number of residents are again concerned - they are worried about the sale of their leisure refuge .
plans have been negotiated , mul@@ led over , debated , and plot@@ ted behind closed doors for months .
now the plans for a new holiday home development on the Kl@@ eines Meer near Em@@ den are in the open .
the interested party , the Em@@ den company `` System@@ -@@ Bau , &apos;&apos; presented their plans to the Em@@ den Council development committee for the first time on Mon@@ day evening .
originally this point was scheduled as a part of the agenda not open to the public .
under pressure from critics of the project and from the F@@ DP faction , who had accused investors and the administration of secre@@ tiveness , R@@ al@@ f Be@@ hr@@ ends of the System@@ -@@ Bau management went on the offensive . `` We do n&apos;t yet have an answer for all the questions , &apos;&apos; he said in front of the council members and more than 50 spec@@ tat@@ ors .
but it is good to be able to counter all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the € 10 - 12 million project has been under discussion for months .
pictures and new details of the proposed hotel building provoked strong reactions among owners of properties at the la@@ ke who attended the me@@ et@@ ing@@ ,
Ro@@ berto Schul@@ z , property owner and member of the board of the residents &apos; lobby group , pro H@@ ieve , claims : `` It &apos;s going to be a huge development which looms over all the other buildings . &apos;&apos;
furthermore , like a number of other critics of the project , he is afraid that traffic will increase enormously due to the proposed size of the facility . `` We have to reckon with whole bus@@ lo@@ ads arriving , &apos;&apos; said Schul@@ z .
however it is not yet clear what exactly is going to happen on the hect@@ are sized area of the former restaurant .
no oper@@ ator has yet been identified .

`` Our journey involved many dark train and bus ri@@ des , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &apos;&apos; she wrote .

for mil@@ dly ob@@ ese di@@ ab@@ e@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful
the benefits of weight loss surgery for mil@@ dly ob@@ ese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
it &apos;s still to early to say whether mil@@ dly ob@@ ese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-@@ surgical treatments , however .
`` The mortality data take a long time to show up , &apos;&apos; said Dr. Robin Blackstone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ A@@ MA surgery .
weight loss operations , or b@@ ari@@ atri@@ c surgery , use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , b@@ ari@@ atri@@ c sur@@ geri@@ es have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies were done in people who are mor@@ bi@@ dly ob@@ ese , with a body mass index -LRB- BM@@ I -RRB- of 35 or above .
BM@@ I , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal between 18@@ .5 and 2@@ 4.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or higher indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a@@ .@@ go@@ v @/@ 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min@@ -@@ Sh@@ eng General Ho@@ spit@@ al used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of b@@ ari@@ atri@@ c surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c bypass and sle@@ eve g@@ ast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mil@@ dly ob@@ ese .
the average BM@@ I among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I among those receiving non-@@ surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29 .
among those who had surgery , diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent .
in the medi@@ call@@ y-@@ treated group , by comparison , diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent .
in addition , control of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ y@@ c@@ eri@@ des , and `` bad &apos;&apos; L@@ D@@ L ch@@ olester@@ ol `` was generally better in the surgical group , &apos;&apos; the authors found .
the researchers also monitored patients &apos; blood levels of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflect blood sugar levels over time .
h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
but this better `` gl@@ y@@ c@@ emi@@ c control &apos;&apos; - as reflected by the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years , according to lead rese@@ ar@@ cher Dr. Chi@@ h@@ -@@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and colleagues .
the research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery .
at the fifth year , compared to the sle@@ eve g@@ ast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y group , the bypass surgery group had lost more weight -LRB- 18@@ .@@ 7 v@@ s 14@@ .@@ 2 kg -RRB- , achieved larger drops in BM@@ I -LRB- 7.@@ 4 v@@ s 5.@@ 1 -RRB- and in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c -LRB- 3.1 percent v@@ s 2.1 percent -RRB- and were more likely to have complete diabetes re@@ mission -LRB- 4@@ 6.@@ 9 percent v@@ s 16@@ .@@ 7 percent -RRB- .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavi@@ er people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life , says Blackstone , of the University of Arizona College of Medic@@ ine-@@ P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x .
in the Swedish study , ob@@ ese people who had b@@ ari@@ atri@@ c surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conventional methods .
though the new study did n&apos;t show a benefit in survival among surgery patients , Blackstone said it &apos;s reassuring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 interested in the procedure .
`` This is where this paper is critical , because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BM@@ I group , &apos;&apos; with no increased risk of death or ren@@ al disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient &apos;s BM@@ I falls between 27 and 30 .
`` I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , &apos;&apos; she said .
I think that once they &apos;ve accumulated these genetic changes that hard@@ wi@@ red their bodies into obesity and diabetes , reversing that is really hard .

`` It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &apos;&apos; - Dalai Lama - R@@ T News
Europe could not host all refugees , the Dalai Lama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees &apos;&apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for compassion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies , at the beginning of his 10-@@ day visit to the UK .
he claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even contin@@ ents .
he also stressed that , however admirable , the West@@ -@@ European countries &apos;&apos; response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation .
`` It it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &apos;&apos; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
`` So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &apos;&apos; he emphasized .
ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of force .
the use of force has never solved these problems , &apos;&apos; he added .
addressing the issue of violence , the Dalai Lama also comm@@ ented on George Bush &apos;s actions following 9 @/@ 11 terrorist attacks , claiming that the US &apos;&apos; violent response en@@ gen@@ dered a chain of uncontrollable events .
after 9 @/@ 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-@@ violence .
I know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences , &apos;&apos; the Dalai Lama said .
four@@ fold increase in children in@@ gest@@ ing hand sani@@ ti@@ zer in last 4 years
poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 40@@ 0-@@ percent up@@ ti@@ ck since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swal@@ lowing high@@ ly-@@ alco@@ holi@@ c hand sani@@ ti@@ zer , according to the Georgia poison Center .
according to Dr. G@@ ay@@ l@@ ord Lopez , director of the Georgia poison Center , hand sani@@ ti@@ zer ing@@ es@@ tion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,@@ 2@@ 66 in 2010 to 16@@ ,@@ 1@@ 17 in 2014 .
`` kids are getting into these products more frequently , and unfortunately , there &apos;s a percentage of them going to the emergency room , &apos;&apos; Lopez told CNN .
he said some kids are drinking sani@@ ti@@ zer intentionally , while some do it to im@@ press their friends or on a social-@@ media dare .
videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sani@@ ti@@ zer for a cheap bu@@ z@@ z .
te@@ ens have reportedly mixed sani@@ ti@@ zer with alco@@ hol@@ -@@ containing mou@@ th@@ w@@ ash for a sti@@ ffer drink .
younger children can be drawn to attractive sani@@ ti@@ zer sc@@ ents .
`` A k@@ id is not thinking this is bad for them , &apos;&apos; Lopez said .
a lot of the more attractive -LRB- hand sani@@ ti@@ zers -RRB- are the ones that are sc@@ ented .
there are stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry , gra@@ pe , or@@ ange@@ -@@ fla@@ vor@@ ed hand sani@@ ti@@ zers that are very appealing to kids .
hand sani@@ ti@@ zer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
in young children , especially , only a few squ@@ ir@@ ts can cause alcohol pois@@ oning .
`` It &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &apos;&apos; Dr. Stephen Th@@ or@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control center at University of Kansas Ho@@ spit@@ al , told Fox 4 in Kansas City .
so you would n&apos;t leave a shot of Wh@@ is@@ key sitting around , but people will have these hand sani@@ ti@@ zers out and if kids get into it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah Rus@@ sell , a six-@@ year-old girl who recently in@@ gest@@ ed as many as four squ@@ ir@@ ts of stra@@ w@@ ber@@ r@@ y-@@ sc@@ ented hand sani@@ ti@@ zer at school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
her blo@@ od-@@ alcohol level was .@@ 17@@ 9 , twice the threshold considered legally dr@@ unk in an adult , according to Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at G@@ win@@ ne@@ tt Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah was sl@@ ur@@ ring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room .
doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children &apos;s hospital for any signs of brain trauma , as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
`` That was very scary , &apos;&apos; Or@@ tori@@ a Scot@@ t , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , told CNN .
it could have been very lethal for my child .
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use non@@ alco@@ holi@@ c products or sani@@ ti@@ zing wi@@ pes short of moving hand sani@@ ti@@ zer out of a child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some sani@@ ti@@ zers have been linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two On@@ t@@ ario women died after swal@@ lowing hand sani@@ ti@@ zer that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health officials sur@@ mis@@ ed that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly agent , rather than eth@@ y@@ l alcohol , which was listed as the active ingredient .
in January , three four@@ th-@@ grade students in up@@ state New York plot@@ ted to poison their `` mean &apos;&apos; teacher `` by putting anti@@ bac@@ teri@@ al products around the classroom , &apos;&apos; according to a police report .
the teacher is highly aller@@ gic to hand sani@@ ti@@ zer and banned it from her room .
police considered the fo@@ iled plan to be `` idle chat@@ ter , &apos;&apos; referring discipline to the school district .

why I &apos;m A Wit@@ ness At An Exec@@ ution In O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
later today , barring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it wo n&apos;t , I will sit in a viewing g@@ aller@@ y in the death cham@@ ber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary as Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by lethal injec@@ tion .
he has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first made back in January , via his best friend , and though I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day approaches , I &apos;ve come to dre@@ ad it .
so why do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
true , journalists are permitted to watch exec@@ utions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who will be chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
whoever is picked will watch it disp@@ assi@@ on@@ ately .
I can not do that .
I will be sitting alongside Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s closest friends , and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hours .
I like the guy .
we often lau@@ gh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say I can not be both a witness and a journalist , so I wo n&apos;t be allowed a no@@ te@@ book and pen to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .
one O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here &apos;s the lesson .
tell the in@@ mate &apos;s story the way he likes it , get access .
I complained to her .
she admitted that she `` could have phra@@ sed it better , &apos;&apos; but still thinks I &apos;m wrong to do what I &apos;m doing .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p has taken issue with some of the things I &apos;ve said and written .
he does n&apos;t tell me what to write , and I would n&apos;t do it even if he did .
I &apos;ve told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be there to write about it .
if he dies , he thinks the publicity will help the anti-@@ death penalty movement .
Kim B@@ ell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ing@@ ton Post , will be alongside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of po@@ d@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I wo n&apos;t go over all the details again here .
I can not say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being an acc@@ ess@@ ory after the fact .
but I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and it &apos;s from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other reporters you can turn to for that .
what you will get from me is what it &apos;s like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death .

Peter Moody alle@@ ges ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit ra@@ cing
Peter Moody has alleged Rac@@ ing Victoria ste@@ wards attempted to plant a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to quit ra@@ cing immediately .
he took aim at ste@@ wards and Rac@@ ing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , alle@@ ging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scrat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment the final stra@@ w on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
Moody told Fair@@ fa@@ x Medi@@ a he had always tried to do what is best for ra@@ cing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s positive sw@@ ab to co@@ bal@@ t , which he can not explain .
he had bitten his ton@@ gue about the spy allegations for 18 months and did n&apos;t want it `` to look like so@@ ur gra@@ pes . &apos;&apos;
`` I was n&apos;t going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once , &apos;&apos; Moody said .
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home t@@ oni@@ ght and sleep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
when they start to think I &apos;m not that &apos;s when I should n&apos;t be a tra@@ iner .
I would then have to consider what I do with my L@@ ic@@ ence .
earlier , Moody had dropped the bomb@@ shell in a ra@@ c@@ ing@@ .com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
`` eighteen months ago Terr@@ y B@@ ai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and D@@ r Bri@@ an Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my st@@ ables to offer information on what I was doing within my st@@ ables , &apos;&apos; Moody said on Rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe I &apos;m a cheat .
if that &apos;s the case surely they should all hand in their brie@@ fs because they &apos;ve been incompetent in trying to catch me .
Robert R@@ oul@@ ston , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Mo@@ o@@ die , current chairman of R@@ V@@ L , and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
should that make me think it &apos;s becoming personal ?
has R@@ V@@ L got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of tra@@ in@@ ers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I that bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think I am .
maybe they need to take my L@@ ic@@ ence off me and push me away and I &apos;ve got no doubt what I &apos;m saying now might make them think about that .
but I &apos;ve got to the point now where I do n&apos;t care and that sad@@ dens me .
that really sad@@ dens me .
I will put the pressure on them and on@@ us on them to make a decision .
I &apos;ve got the support of my family and I can walk away .
the tra@@ iner &apos;s frustration levels have built with the long-@@ running co@@ bal@@ t inquiry involving Li@@ dar@@ i and the late scrat@@ ching had him saying that he could `` throw my L@@ ic@@ ence across the table . &apos;&apos;
Moody , best known for preparing unbe@@ aten champion Black c@@ avi@@ ar , lab@@ elled the ra@@ ce-@@ day treatment rule `` ridi@@ culous &apos;&apos; after a mud or cla@@ y po@@ ul@@ ti@@ ce had been applied to the hor@@ ses legs , which is against the rules .
it &apos;s against the rules of ra@@ cing .
I &apos;ve got to accept full responsibility for that , &apos;&apos; he said .
one of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg .
it could have had it last night .
it could have had it yesterday , which it did have .
it had it on race day .
Moody could be faced with a three-@@ month dis@@ quali@@ fication for the race day treatment using the po@@ ul@@ ti@@ ce , which ste@@ wards have opened an inquiry into .
it is a joke .
people making these rules know nothing about the horse .
`` We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far , &apos;&apos; Moody said .

Melbourne storm co@@ ach C@@ rai@@ g B@@ ell@@ am@@ y hits back at rivals over wre@@ st@@ ling claims
Melbourne storm co@@ ach C@@ rai@@ g B@@ ell@@ am@@ y has called criticism of his side &apos;s tackling as `` agenda setting &apos;&apos; by the N@@ R@@ L &apos;s two premier@@ ship fa@@ vo@@ ur@@ ites .
Sydney ro@@ o@@ sters co@@ ach Tr@@ ent Robinson said the refer@@ ees allowed the storm to `` wre@@ st@@ le &apos;&apos; his side during the storm &apos;s upset win in the quali@@ fying final in Sydney on Fri@@ day night .
B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e B@@ ron@@ cos co@@ ach W@@ ay@@ ne Ben@@ ne@@ tt made a thin@@ ly veiled reference to the storm after his side &apos;s quali@@ fying final win over North Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land co@@ w@@ boys on Satur@@ day night when he called that game a `` show@@ case &apos;&apos; of the ru@@ g@@ by league and said the two Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land were n&apos;t `` too big &apos;&apos; into wre@@ st@@ ling .
B@@ ell@@ am@@ y defended his side &apos;s tackling and said they just focused on their `` contact &apos;&apos; when tackling .
B@@ ell@@ am@@ y added he took confidence from having two leading co@@ aches critici@@ se his side as it meant they were concerned about the storm beating them .
`` That keeps coming up - I did n&apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson bring up wre@@ st@@ ling when they beat us 2@@ 4-@@ 2 , &apos;&apos; B@@ ell@@ am@@ y said on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
I can guarantee we have n&apos;t changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques , it &apos;s just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackl@@ es and that has been the turn around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to co@@ ach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it &apos;s fun@@ ny how this always comes up at this time of year .
B@@ ell@@ am@@ y challenged Ben@@ ne@@ tt &apos;s idea of `` exciting football &apos;&apos; remin@@ ding his ment@@ or that Ben@@ ne@@ tt &apos;s S@@ t Geor@@ ge-@@ Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra dra@@ g@@ ons won the premier@@ ship in 2010 by playing `` boring &apos;&apos; football .
W@@ ay@@ ne is talking about exciting foot@@ y .
he made a point of comparing his game on Satur@@ day night with our one on Fri@@ day night and how exciting their game was , &apos;&apos; B@@ ell@@ am@@ y said .
I remember in 2010 S@@ t George was critici@@ sed a lot for being a boring team and W@@ ay@@ ne said he did n&apos;t give a rat &apos;s ar@@ se .
but now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting foot@@ y , especially his young hal@@ ves with their speed .
that &apos;s the foot@@ y you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
he made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his style of foot@@ y - not every team has two hal@@ ves like An@@ th@@ ony Mil@@ ford and Ben hunt so they can play like that .
to me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
six weeks ago they probably were n&apos;t thinking of us when they get to the big games .
B@@ ell@@ am@@ y also pointed out the storm and ro@@ o@@ sters game was a higher scor@@ ing contest than the B@@ ron@@ cos and co@@ w@@ boys game .
the B@@ ron@@ cos game was probably a good game , I have n&apos;t watched it yet but what was the score ? 16@@ -@@ 12 ?
our game it was 20-@@ 18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting foot@@ y ?
or is it making breaks and not scor@@ ing tries that is exciting ?
to me it &apos;s agendas .
if they are men@@ tioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
the storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land co@@ w@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la sh@@ ark@@ s in next Satur@@ day night &apos;s preliminary final at A@@ AM@@ I Park with ti@@ ckets on sale from next Tu@@ es@@ day morning .
Serbian man gets $ 200@@ k bail on drug charge
a man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smugg@@ led into Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land has been granted bail on a $ 200,000 su@@ re@@ ty .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tra@@ cked 100 kilograms of the drug from the y@@ acht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and do@@ cked at Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed meeting with his co-@@ accused at the mar@@ ina throughout the morning and later met them at the Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ ad@@ house c@@ afe , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine , Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the c@@ afe for an innocent purpose .
Supreme Court Judge Peter F@@ lan@@ agan was concerned Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was a flight risk .
he has clear connections to Serbia .
he tra@@ vels to Serbia often , &apos;&apos; he told the court on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
on the cro@@ wn case he lied to police about where he was staying .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had jointly offered a su@@ re@@ ty of $ 200,000 to secure his release .
`` Ha@@ ving read the affi@@ da@@ v@@ its of both those persons , it is clear that the imposition of a su@@ re@@ ty of $ 200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them , &apos;&apos; Judge F@@ lan@@ agan said .
but that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian pas@@ sports , report to police on a daily basis and adher@@ es to a 6@@ p@@ m@@ -@@ 6@@ am cur@@ few .

he was asked about his convers@@ ations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
he said he was doing it to l@@ ure them in .
he said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images .

traffickers move towards Germany over minor border cro@@ s@@ sings .
more and more refugees are being picked up away from major control points on the German-@@ Austrian border .
due to fear of discovery and people being arrested , many traffickers are leaving

more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the border river of In@@ n in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal@@ -@@ In@@ n since Tu@@ es@@ day .
they had arrived on foot over bridges and wei@@ rs on the German side .
they are received there by Federal police and passed on for registration .
according to reports from the Federal police , significantly more refugees arrived at the main rail@@ way station in Munich on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day compared to the beginning of the week .

St@@ ut@@ t@@ gar@@ t : tail end of tropical storm `` Henry &apos;&apos; expected in the south west
Met@@ eor@@ ologists are warning of squ@@ alls in the south west from W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day evening on@@ wards .
due to a depression over western Europe at the moment , warm sea air is flowing into the country , the German Met@@ eor@@ ological service -LRB- D@@ W@@ D -RRB- has advised .
the powerful trou@@ gh is the tail end of tropical storm `` Henry , &apos;&apos; which has moved over the Atlantic from the Ber@@ mu@@ da Islands in the last few days .
violent storms and th@@ under@@ storms are anticipated , particularly in B@@ aden .
according to D@@ W@@ D , gu@@ sts of between 60 and 90 kilom@@ et@@ res per hour can be anticipated on the Sw@@ abi@@ an Mo@@ un@@ tains and in Boden@@ seek@@ reis .

the chas@@ sis makes the difference : every two years car manufacturers present their new models at the IA@@ A
in 2015 movement can be noticed in particular in compact cars , which are selling especially well at the moment .
compact class cars are currently very much in demand : according to the Federal Office for Motor Transport -LRB- K@@ BA -RRB- about 2@@ 8.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations in August alone belonged to this segment .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A -LRB- public days 17 to 27 September -RRB- .
in among all the f@@ ut@@ ur@@ istic concept vehicles and the new high-@@ end and luxury models , this year above all it is new compact models which are being introduced .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car sector here is the Op@@ el A@@ str@@ a , which hits the car deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
`` The A@@ str@@ a is an extremely important model for us , &apos;&apos; said Op@@ el boss Kar@@ l-@@ Thomas Neum@@ ann at the show .
it is at the heart of the brand .
to ensure that it sells well , the price of the new A@@ str@@ a is not increasing significantly .
Op@@ el proposes an entry point below that of its main competitor , the V@@ W Golf , which starts at € 17@@ ,@@ 6@@ 50 .
the latest A@@ str@@ a costs from € 16@@ ,@@ 9@@ 90 .
with a new 1.4 lit@@ re engine , the A@@ str@@ a has an output of 74 k@@ W @/@ 100 H@@ P .
the H@@ es@@ sian manufactur@@ er also offers diesel and petro@@ l engines from 70 k@@ W @/@ 95 H@@ P to 14@@ 7 k@@ W @/@ 200 H@@ P , including the first three cy@@ lin@@ der petro@@ l model .
unlike its most important competitors , V@@ W Golf and Ford focus , for the first time the Op@@ el A@@ str@@ a is only available as a five door .
in spring the estate car , already seen at the IA@@ A , will follow as the second option
and what other compact cars are being introduced alongside the A@@ str@@ a at the IA@@ A ?
Ren@@ ault M@@ é@@ gan@@ e : Ren@@ ault intro@@ duces the fourth generation of its competitor to the A@@ str@@ a , the M@@ é@@ gan@@ e , into the race .
the M@@ é@@ gan@@ e can be seen at the show exclusively as a five-@@ door , in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly spor@@ ty version .
it will be available in deal@@ er@@ ships at the beginning of next year , then also as an estate model .
In@@ fini@@ ti : the In@@ fini@@ ti Q@@ 30 is brand new in this segment .
the N@@ is@@ san off@@ shoot is looking to find its place in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact In@@ fini@@ ti , with its cur@@ ved lines , fits right into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will have a petro@@ l engine with a performance of at least 90 k@@ W @/@ 1@@ 22 H@@ P .
a diesel with 80 k@@ W @/@ 10@@ 9 H@@ P or 125 k@@ W @/@ 170 H@@ P is also on offer .
Suzuki Bal@@ en@@ o : also new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ en@@ o , which celeb@@ rates its world pre@@ mi@@ ere in Frankfurt .
on offer is the petro@@ l engine model , including a newly developed 1.@@ 0 lit@@ re tur@@ bo engine and a performance of 82 k@@ W @/@ 1@@ 11 H@@ P .
according to the man@@ fac@@ tur@@ er &apos;s specific@@ ations , the maximum tor@@ que is 170 New@@ ton met@@ res -LRB- N@@ m -RRB- .
the Bal@@ en@@ o is launched in Europe in early 2016 .
DS@@ 4 : not totally new , but completely re@@ designed , is the Ds 4 compact car model , which can be seen at the IA@@ A .
the design@@ ers at the class@@ y C@@ it@@ ro@@ ë@@ n off@@ shoot have turned their hand primarily to the front end : here the radi@@ ator gri@@ lle has been newly designed and the modified head@@ lights have been equipped with L@@ E@@ D technology .
in the interior the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system in particular has been moderni@@ sed , the number of but@@ tons on the touch screen has been reduced and for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ P@@ lay has been incorporated .
in the compact class the IA@@ A also features a string of revised and new versions such as the updated Mer@@ ce@@ des A C@@ lass or the P@@ eu@@ geo@@ t 30@@ 8 .
J@@ V@@ A Berlin T@@ egel : five-@@ squar@@ e-@@ met@@ re cells are un@@ fit for human beings
the Federal Constitutional Court has upheld a compla@@ int by a former in@@ mate of T@@ egel prison that he had been hous@@ ed for months in too small a cell .
in principle , prisoners have a right to financial compensation for violation to their human dignity if they are kept in cells which are too small .
the Federal Constitutional Court reached this decision in a public ruling on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
according to the judge , those affected can actually hope for money if they have been shut in too small a room for only a few days -LRB- re@@ f : 1 B@@ v@@ R 11@@ 27 @/@ 14 -RRB- .
for this reason a former prisoner was successful with his constitutional compla@@ int in Kar@@ l@@ s@@ ruhe . he was detained in Berlin T@@ egel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a floor area of around five square met@@ res : the to@@ i@@ let was not in a separate room .
afterwards the man , who according to a statement by his lawyer has since been released , was transferred to a larger cell .
his liability claim against the state of Berlin by reason of un@@ suitable prison conditions however , failed .
but the constitutional judges set aside the jud@@ gement of the Supreme Court in Berlin and re@@ submitted the case there for renewed assessment .
in their view the human dignity of the man had been violated .
the Supreme Court is now deciding the amount of the damages .
even if for legal reasons only a few days of the period in custody are significant for compensation , entitlement to a claim for compensation exists .
otherwise there would be `` fears of deterioration of a person &apos;s right to protection . &apos;&apos;
the Supreme Court must now settle the amount of pec@@ uni@@ ary compensation .
constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
as recently as April they awarded damages to a prisoner because he had been locked in his cell naked .
a cell with multiple functions and without a separate to@@ i@@ let is also in@@ humane , according to a decision from 2011 .
furthermore Kar@@ l@@ s@@ ruhe confirmed on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day that in addition , according to the Berlin Constitutional Court , a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 had at@@ tested to in@@ humane accommodation
the prisoner at that time was kept in a similar cell to that in the Kar@@ l@@ s@@ ruhe case daily between 3 p@@ .@@ m@@ . and 9 p@@ .@@ m@@ . for over three months
Berlin prisons have also hit the headlines in the last few weeks due to lack of staff .
because of this , prisoners are time and again locked up for 23 hours , aggressi@@ veness rises and it has even led to bra@@ w@@ ls due to the tense situation .
according to information from the press office of the public prosecutor , 21 positions in T@@ egel have not been filled due to a lack of young people , and 19 will cease to exist in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : `` We can handle it &apos;&apos;
the influx of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what changes will we see in Germany ?
according to the predictions of the Federal Minister of the Interior , around 800,000 asylum seekers will arrive in Germany this year , and according to a statement by Vice Chancellor Si@@ g@@ mar Gabriel -LRB- SPD -RRB- , Germany is actually in a position to take in a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel -LRB- CDU -RRB- has demonstrated determination in the face of this unusual challenge . `` I say again and again : we can handle it , and we will handle it . &apos;&apos;
the following is a summary of what is coming to Germany .
according to various forecasts between 3@@ 50,000 -LRB- estim@@ ation by the Ministry of buildings -RRB- and 400,000 -LRB- estim@@ ation by the P@@ est@@ el Institute -RRB- homes will be needed annually - and in fact for the next five years .
that is twice as many as are being built at the moment -LRB- 250,000 homes -RRB- .
the lack of living space is dramatic but above all for affordable r@@ ental properties : between 60,000 and 8@@ 0,000 social dwell@@ ings per year are excluded from rent control and refugees will also compete for these particularly cheap homes .
Federal building minister Barbar@@ a H@@ end@@ ri@@ cks -LRB- SPD -RRB- thus wants to double funding from the current € 5@@ 18 million to € 1 billion .
in the view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute this is far too little : 8@@ 0,000 social dwell@@ ings must be developed annually and for this the government must invest a sum of € 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
academics and the Federal Building Ministry agree that as well as this more tax benefits must be provided for investment in the building of housing .
according to estimates by the Institute for Emp@@ loyment Research , it could be expected that in the long term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany should be able to work .
however the refugees in Germany are not being systematically asked about their qualifications so as to be able to help them get started , critici@@ sed Clau@@ dia Walter , project manager for integration and training in the Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann Foundation .
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contact and to appreciation of the host society , and also to the self-@@ esteem of the immigrant says migration rese@@ ar@@ cher Di@@ et@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hard@@ t .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hard@@ t , a political shift has taken place in Germany : from a ban on employment for refugees to an appreciation of work .
while in the past asylum seekers were forbidden to work for up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as with the residence obligation which limits asylum seekers to one place of dom@@ ici@@ le .
as far as the majority of society is now concerned , particularly in view of skills shortage , refugees should be allowed to gain faster access to the job market .
one big obstacle to access to the jobs market is the lack of knowledge of the German language .
to date there is still no adequate supply of general and work@@ -related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often found through personal contact .
thus , in Thr@@ än@@ hard@@ t &apos;s view , the building of networks is the ideal solution to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has noticed that only a few refugee parents have placed their children in kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten ; an estimated one to 15 percent . `` For the upro@@ oted parents their first priority is to keep the family together , &apos;&apos; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokesman for youth and family affairs in the Berlin Senate administration .
to be able to convince families of the benefits of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ tens , the administration is issuing le@@ af@@ lets in a number of languages .
if the need for teachers increases sharply because of the large number of refugees the Berlin Senate would try to raise the training capacity , for example by allowing for more technical colle@@ ges .
in the states , pup@@ ils with no knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in welcoming classes .
however they will not always be taught by fully qualified teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a quali@@ fication in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of these , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration .
the German student services estimate that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle no federal state prohi@@ bits asylum seekers or those with long-term refugee status from studying - the only exception up to now was Berlin : Senator for the Interior Frank Hen@@ kel -LRB- CDU -RRB- has however now abandoned his stance .
refugees who want to study may have their entrance to university facilitated .
refugees with a residence permit or protection against deport@@ ation no longer receive benefits according to the asylum seekers benefits act if they begin a course of study .
in principle the latter receive no grant , as they do not fall into the category of persons entitled to a grant .
tolerated refugees up to now must have lived for years in Germany in order to be entitled to a grant ; from 1 January 2016 this period is reduced to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , claim St@@ eff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student services .
the students should receive a grant immediately .
Islam will play an important role in the future as the refugees are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have and the existing state-@@ church law should be developed into a state-@@ religion relationship .
the founding of an Islamic welfare organisation , which looks after new arri@@ vals in a professional manner , is also important .
rights also involve responsibilities .
thus the representatives of Islam must agree to clear points of contact and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to concede certain control options .
this also requires the readiness to act courage@@ ously against religious fundamentalism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ z@@ ye@@ k , expressed the fear on Th@@ urs@@ day that religious conflict could also be brought to Germany .
those who want to wage such conflict in Germany `` have immediately for@@ fei@@ ted their right to stay here in Germany , &apos;&apos; he said on Bav@@ arian radio .
he suggested transl@@ ating this basic law into Arabic .
in the future integration will be a topic for the whole of society even more than it is today .
this means too that mainstream society will have to change and the removal of discrimination and racism is becoming more urgent .
for nearly 10 years , as a result of European ru@@ lings , Germany has had an anti-@@ discrimination agency and a general equality act .
but it is learning very slowly , as the N@@ S@@ U murder series shows , that racist motives are systematically ignored in the police and the authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organis@@ ations and non-@@ white German pressure groups have demanded for a long time , and to which international treaties such as the anti racism convention in Germany are committed , must become reality in the next 10 years if the country wants to remain at peace and to exploit the opportunities of its new citizens - for the good of everyone .
Germany is in a position generally to provide medical care for the refugees expected up to now , is the opinion of the president of the Doc@@ tors &apos; Association , Frank Ul@@ rich Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
`` As far as manpower and capacity are concerned , we can cope , &apos;&apos; he told the Tages@@ spiegel .
however extra money must be added to the system for this .
in order to avoid bottlen@@ ecks , Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery asked for all new arri@@ vals to be issued with healthcare cards when they register .
services provided can be accounted for with the Federal states later .
and in the long term it is highly doubtful that so many people can be f@@ ob@@ bed off with the limited cat@@ alo@@ gue of services for which the Ben@@ ef@@ its for Asyl@@ um seekers Act provides .
apart from this , doctors are making it their priority to deal with the language barrier .
up to now , as Berlin health rese@@ ar@@ cher The@@ a Bor@@ de has established , migrants have received poorer information about their illnesses than other patients .
interpre@@ ters must be taken on not only in hospitals but also in doctors &apos; practices , she demands .
but many refugees would also already be helped with more general medicine dro@@ p@@ -@@ in cent@@ res in emergency rooms .
and with a different diagnostic view .
refugee children for example clearly suffer from more un@@ treated disabilities , and with young people it is more a case of information about HIV .
German doctors though are able to use their training to deal with the partly different disease patterns , said Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery
`` parasi@@ te infections or tuberculosis are not that difficult to recogni@@ se . &apos;&apos; And because of the refugees there is possibly relief in sight for the shortage of doctors .
Syria has a highly developed educational system and a number of refugees are expected to be doctors .
to be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take more exam@@ s .
in the estim@@ ation of the Federal P@@ sycho@@ therapeutic Association -LRB- B@@ P@@ t@@ K -RRB- , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most of them are suffering from post-@@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Di@@ et@@ rich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be published study by the tu in Munich documents that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from post-@@ traumatic stress disorder suffer among other things from so-called fl@@ ash@@ backs , difficulties in breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fear of death .
further symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders , nerv@@ ousness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
up to now , however , only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
mentally ill asylum seekers are permitted to make an application with the social security services for psycho@@ therapy , but processing usually takes several months .
in addition , it is mostly officials or doctors in the social services who are not trained in psychological illnesses who decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this frequently leads to false assessments , says Mun@@ z .

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a po@@ dium .
he was un@@ hurt , but video of the fall went viral on social media .
the opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against boo@@ ing Mr Mugabe during his address .
last month , they boo@@ ed and hec@@ kl@@ ed him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tu@@ es@@ day .
movement for Democratic Change -LRB- MDC -RRB- chief whi@@ p innocent G@@ on@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt N@@ r Mugabe &apos;s address .
`` The message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it &apos;s tit@@ led ` death &apos; , &apos;&apos; he told journalists after Mr Mugabe &apos;s speech .
it warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
the chief whi@@ p said the party , led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is `` worried &apos;&apos; about the threats to its politicians .
He@@ wle@@ t@@ t-@@ Pack@@ ard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ wle@@ t@@ t-@@ Pack@@ ard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-@@ saving efforts at it enterprise services business .
H@@ P is split@@ ting into two listed companies later this year , separating its computer and prin@@ ter businesses from its fa@@ ster@@ -@@ growing corporate hardware and services operations .
the expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.@@ 7@@ bn , beginning in the fourth quarter , H@@ P said in a statement .
`` These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard En@@ ter@@ pri@@ se , &apos;&apos; said Me@@ g Wh@@ it@@ man , the H@@ P chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
`` He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard En@@ ter@@ pri@@ se will be smaller and more focused than H@@ P is today , and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business , &apos;&apos; said Wh@@ it@@ man .
as a separate company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ wle@@ tt Pack@@ ard En@@ ter@@ pri@@ se will have more than $ 50@@ bn in annual revenue and `` will be focused on delivering un@@ rival@@ ed integrated technology solutions &apos;&apos; to companies , according to a company statement .
it breaks up a company formed in the 193@@ 0s by Stanford University graduates Bill He@@ wle@@ tt and Da@@ ve Pack@@ ard to make electric equipment , and whose Palo Al@@ to gar@@ age has been dubbed `` the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &apos;&apos;
H@@ P has been undergoing a massive re@@ organisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .

arsenal captain Mi@@ kel Ar@@ tet@@ a says te@@ am@@ -@@ mates must get behind injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere ahead of D@@ in@@ amo Z@@ agre@@ b tie
Wen@@ ger has also stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is still only September and , providing his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he can not be back playing by Christmas .
that best-@@ case scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and , given his history , his involvement in next summer &apos;s European Champi@@ on@@ ship is clearly uncertain .
the great shame of this latest problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished last season strongly after a separate ank@@ le injury and then looked back to his old sharp@@ ness during pre-@@ season .
`` This kind of injury is not care@@ er-@@ threatening , &apos;&apos; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
it is nothing major .
this was just an accident .
it was not linked with his ank@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
that might be true from a purely medical perspective but , as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return mi@@ dse@@ as@@ on .
there is also an uncomfortable pattern developing .
research by Premier injuries L@@ t@@ d records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere ail@@ ments since he made his de@@ but six years ago .
he has also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 15@@ 7 league games during the last five seas@@ ons .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seas@@ ons since 2007-@@ 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue .
`` Som@@ e@@ times , when you are coming back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition , &apos;&apos; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to get over that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves .
with Arsenal beginning their Champi@@ ons League campaign on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day night against D@@ in@@ amo Z@@ agre@@ b ahead of matches with Chelsea on Satur@@ day and Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day , Wen@@ ger is preparing to rot@@ ate his team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor B@@ ell@@ er@@ í@@ n and A@@ ar@@ on Ram@@ sey have not trav@@ elled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ thi@@ eu De@@ buch@@ y and Ar@@ tet@@ a are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger may also begin with Ki@@ er@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d in place of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
`` I try to keep the balance and give a little brea@@ ther to players who need it , &apos;&apos; said Wen@@ ger .
although Arsenal are clear fa@@ vo@@ ur@@ ites to progress through Group F , the Mak@@ simi@@ r stadium in Z@@ agre@@ b is among Europe &apos;s most intimi@@ dating .
D@@ in@@ amo are also unbe@@ aten in 41 matches after producing their own `` inv@@ inci@@ ble &apos;&apos; campaign last season .
the stadium was shaken on Tu@@ es@@ day night by an earth tre@@ m@@ or that measured 3.2 on the Richter .
it was the 10@@ th in Z@@ agre@@ b this year .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal have lear@@ nt the lesson of last season &apos;s Champi@@ ons League capit@@ ulation against Mon@@ ac@@ o and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph .
`` This drive is immense , &apos;&apos; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never been done at Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ F@@ est : the com@@ edy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is glaring , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever , with suicide rates am@@ on@@ gst young males at 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-@@ 45 in the UK , and remains three times more common in males than fem@@ ales .
in a bid to address the problem , the C@@ amp@@ ai@@ gn Ag@@ ainst Li@@ ving miser@@ ably -LRB- calm -RRB- announced 2015 as the Year of the male , aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high-@@ school students disp@@ laying depressive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a high enough percentage of `` healthy mood &apos;&apos; friends , their chances of recovering doubled .
equally , for those not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the chances of mental challenges arising .
but of course , for friendship to work , it needs to be accessible in the first place .
in this age of social-@@ media led communication , with its focus on style over substance , immedi@@ acy of response is often prioriti@@ sed over meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun@@ -@@ loving and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrinsi@@ c values - our inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply impacts our mental health .
and as a billion@@ aire vide@@ o-@@ game cre@@ ator explained recently , money really does n&apos;t buy greater happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head .
each of the charac@@ ters were not defined by their work , but rather their personalities , which sh@@ one through the interaction as friends .
the hu@@ mo@@ ur of Jo@@ ey and C@@ hand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments watching football on the com@@ fy chairs , and Ro@@ ss &apos;s p@@ ining for Rach@@ el , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all relate to this , even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings .
as a Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an worker explained to me : ... . &apos;&apos; my listening role to people feeling depressed and suicidal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference . &apos;&apos;
often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
the old ad@@ age of `` getting on with it &apos;&apos; is strong , as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems . &apos;&apos;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term coping mechanisms .
it highlighted the little moments of male friendship .
as much as my objective , outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation , the long-term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
and so , if you attend com@@ edy Central &apos;s Fri@@ end@@ s@@ F@@ est this weekend , with the sets fully re@@ designed in celebration , why not take your friends for a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , better still , if in Star@@ bu@@ cks you see someone alone , give a smile and say hell@@ o .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is broad@@ casting on com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the full 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ F@@ est
Di Maria scores to help P@@ S@@ G sw@@ at aside Mal@@ mo
An@@ gel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after scor@@ ing against Mal@@ mo .
An@@ gel Di Maria scored on his Champi@@ ons League de@@ but to help P@@ S@@ G ease past Swedish side Mal@@ mo on Tu@@ es@@ day .
here &apos;s the match report and reaction to the game .
An@@ gel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani were on target as Paris S@@ ain@@ t-@@ Ger@@ main began their Champi@@ ons League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-@@ 0 win against Mal@@ mo at the Par@@ c des princes on Tu@@ es@@ day .
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champi@@ ons League de@@ but as a P@@ S@@ G player to set the French champions on their way , but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cav@@ ani headed home in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ kh@@ tar Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just quali@@ fication for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quar@@ ter-@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a vin@@ tage display by La@@ ur@@ ent Blan@@ c &apos;s side with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c wasteful in front of goal and later being substitu@@ ted against his hom@@ et@@ own team and the club with whom he started his illu@@ stri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
`` It &apos;s not easy to win at home or away in the Champi@@ ons League , so to win 2-@@ 0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on , &apos;&apos; said Blan@@ c .
it aug@@ urs well .
we wanted to win and we did , although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more .
Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-@@ 2 draw at home by Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x in Li@@ gue 1 at the weekend , but he was up@@ staged in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentina w@@ inger was lab@@ elled as the man to take P@@ S@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Mar@@ co Ver@@ rat@@ ti &apos;s pass in behind the Mal@@ mo def@@ ence before ang@@ ling a beautiful finish past Joh@@ an Wil@@ and and into the far corner of the net .
however , if anyone then expected P@@ S@@ G to ro@@ mp to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
Mal@@ mo , who beat Cel@@ tic in a pla@@ y-@@ off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full internation@@ als on the field at kick@@ -off and , with a five-@@ man def@@ ence and two deep in mid@@ field , were stu@@ ff@@ y opponents .
but , save for a Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic shot that sli@@ d just wide of Kevin Tra@@ p@@ p &apos;s far post in the 3@@ 4@@ th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , P@@ S@@ G let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor fini@@ shing , not least from Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cav@@ ani just after the restart .
nevertheless , he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c pass that Di Maria sent in a cur@@ ling shot which was ti@@ pped around the post by Wil@@ and on 52 minutes .
the second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an heading home his sixth of the season after Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had fli@@ cked on a left-wing cross from Ma@@ x@@ well .
that ended any ideas that Mal@@ mo had of coming back into the game , and only a super@@ b stop by Wil@@ and from poin@@ t-@@ blan@@ k range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute E@@ z@@ equi@@ el La@@ ve@@ z@@ zi had a goal dis@@ allowed right at the death .
Mal@@ mo co@@ ach Age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted P@@ S@@ G were a class above his side , the Norwegi@@ an saying : `` Our last Champi@@ ons League game was in December last year . &apos;&apos;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level .
the quali@@ fi@@ ers are not enough .
hat@@ s off to Paris .
it was a magni@@ fic@@ ent match from them .
Glen@@ core raises $ 2.5 billion in share sales
Swi@@ ss@@ -based mining giant Glen@@ core , hit by collapsing commodities prices , on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day raised $ 2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt-@@ slashing plan .
Lond@@ on-@@ listed Glen@@ core said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay down debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is grap@@ pling with t@@ umbling commodity prices as China &apos;s economic slowdown weighs on demand and spark@@ s havoc across markets .
the rights issue sent Glen@@ core &apos;s share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
shares jumped 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ S@@ E 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core had last week revealed the $ 2.@@ 5-@@ billion shares sale as part of broader plans to slash its $ 30 billion debt pile by about a third .
the company sold the new stock at 125 p@@ ence per share , which marked a 2.@@ 4-@@ percent discount to the closing price on Tu@@ es@@ day .
it off@@ loaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns over prolonged stalled Chinese growth have slashed iron ore prices by roughly a half , as coal , copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent .

White House confirms Xi Jinping &apos;s Washington Vi@@ sit
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in a statement on Tu@@ es@@ day .
the visit , Xi &apos;s first official one to Washington , will take place on S@@ ept . 25 and reciproc@@ ates President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , the statement said .
the U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife P@@ eng Li@@ yuan at a state dinner that evening , after the two leaders have engaged in bilateral talks .
`` President Xi &apos;s visit will present an opportunity to expand U.@@ S@@ .@@ -@@ China cooperation on a range of global , regional , and bilateral issues of mutual interest , while also enabling President Obama and President Xi to address areas of disagreement construc@@ tively , &apos;&apos; the statement added .
Xi , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to stop in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington , before going on to New York City for the U.@@ N@@ . General Assembly on S@@ ept .
Obama and Xi are expected to bro@@ ach a range of contentious issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns over China &apos;s alleged cyber@@ espionage and its increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : pe@@ p Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented switch to F@@ C Bay@@ ern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ avi has played for the al-@@ Sad@@ d sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015 .
a few years ago , F@@ C Bay@@ ern was apparently close to committing to Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who at the time was playing for F@@ C Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times c@@ up winner , four times Champi@@ ons League winner , twice club world champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - X@@ avi &apos;s list of tit@@ les is breath@@ -@@ taking .
in the summer the then 3@@ 5-@@ year-old left F@@ C Barcelona after 24 years and transferred to Qatar and the al-@@ Sad@@ d sport Club .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi reveals now that just before the 2008 European Champi@@ on@@ ship he was ready to leave Barcelona .
`` I was told that Bar@@ ç@@ a wanted to sell me . &apos;&apos;
`` At the time Madrid were winning everything and we were n&apos;t , &apos;&apos; he says .
and F@@ C Bay@@ ern noticed that too .
X@@ avi : `` There was an offer from Bay@@ ern . &apos;&apos;
`` Rum@@ men@@ i@@ g@@ ge wanted to have me . &apos;&apos;
a quick reminder : in the summer of 2008 , J@@ ür@@ gen K@@ lin@@ s@@ mann took over at F@@ C Bay@@ ern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not transfer .
the transfer never happened .
and instead the crucial man now works for the German record champion : pe@@ p Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why . `` Bar@@ ç@@ a had signed on Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a brilliant European Champi@@ on@@ ship . &apos;&apos;
`` P@@ ep@@ e told me that I should n&apos;t transfer , that he could n&apos;t imagine the team without me . &apos;&apos;
`` He got me with that . &apos;&apos;
who knows how Bay@@ ern &apos;s 2008 @/@ 2009 season would have turned out if X@@ avi had left .
X@@ avi covered the entire distance on the tur@@ f for Bar@@ ç@@ a in the quarter final of the Champi@@ ons League against Bay@@ ern , kno@@ cked the Re@@ ds out -LRB- 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 -RRB- and at the end celebrated the pre@@ mi@@ ere class triumph .
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on down@@ plays diversity in film@@ making
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on confronted African-American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it was n&apos;t needed behind the scenes .
during Sunday night &apos;s episode of H@@ B@@ O &apos;s Project Green@@ light , the seas@@ oned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black prot@@ agon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen scre@@ en@@ play .
`` When we &apos;re talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show , &apos;&apos; Dam@@ on asserted .
shocked , Brown reacted with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief , letting out `` Ho@@ o ! W@@ ow . ok@@ ay , &apos;&apos; as The Mar@@ ti@@ an actor &apos;s comments settled in the air .
Dam@@ on and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show &apos;s fin@@ alists .
`` I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is , how they &apos;re going to treat the character of harmony , &apos;&apos; Brown initially said .
the only black character who &apos;s a ho@@ ok@@ er who gets hit by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the De@@ ar White People producer pushed for fin@@ alists Le@@ o Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the rights to direct the film ; Dam@@ on ret@@ or@@ ted their directing could `` end up giving us something we do n&apos;t want . &apos;&apos;
after the discussion aired , social media exploded in dis@@ approval over Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr@@ Po@@ oni expressed anger toward the cli@@ p writing , `` Mat@@ t Dam@@ on speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is so White it hur@@ ts . &apos;&apos;
the t@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since being post@@ ed .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves matter movement took nationwide effect , urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color .
in February , singer Prince all@@ u@@ ded to the movement while introducing the nomine@@ es of al@@ bu@@ m of the Year at the Gra@@ m@@ my A@@ wards .
`` Al@@ bu@@ ms still matter , &apos;&apos; he said .
like books and black lives , al@@ bu@@ ms still matter .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Eli@@ sab@@ eth Has@@ sel@@ be@@ ck &apos;s question of whether the group should be considered a hate group .
`` The Black Li@@ ves matter Network is a love group , &apos;&apos; leaders said .
Dam@@ on was recently announced as one of a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gul@@ s invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church &apos;s portra@@ yal in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear .

the competition show , which just wra@@ pped up its 7@@ th season , has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season fin@@ ale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o and cam@@ er@@ am@@ an Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , made it to the final round .
the final task involved clim@@ bing a 7@@ 5-@@ foot ro@@ pe in 30 sec@@ onds .

Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o spoke with E ! news after the hard-@@ fought victory , still in shock about winning the $ 1 million grand prize .

it was only his third quality start in his past nine out@@ ings .
`` I just want to finish strong this year , &apos;&apos; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard for the bul@@ l@@ pen to throw every game , and that &apos;s why I want to go deep into the game .
Tigers designated hit@@ ter Victor Mar@@ tin@@ ez had three hits and drove in two runs , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid-@@ August .
it was Mar@@ tin@@ ez &apos;s first three-@@ hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .

hundreds of refugees to be given accommodation in Wi@@ es@@ b@@ aden
a train carrying hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
they are expected to arrive by W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day night .
the people who have trav@@ elled there will then be hous@@ ed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wi@@ es@@ b@@ aden , according to a statement made by the city of Wi@@ es@@ b@@ aden on Tu@@ es@@ day evening .
they estimate that between 450 and 750 refugees will arrive .
a number of sports h@@ alls in the H@@ es@@ sian capital have been prepared for this eventu@@ ality over the last few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be provided with temporary accommodation in these .
after this they should be re@@ distributed to other communities .
according to a statement by the regional council of Gi@@ essen , responsible for their initial rec@@ eption , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse in the past ten days alone
due to the large number of refugees , emergency shelter has also been set up in sports h@@ alls in Frankfurt and Han@@ au .
I@@ sch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang I@@ sch@@ inger , believes that military action in Syria with participation from Germany is a possibility .
`` I believe that determined consideration about military courses of action should not take place without Germany , &apos;&apos; he said .
he accused the European nations of `` collectively looking the other way . &apos;&apos;
four years ago one would have been happy for the ch@@ al@@ ice of military involvement to pass Germany by .
`` Now the conflict has come cra@@ shing down at our front door , &apos;&apos; he said on the German World Service .
the former German Ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid locally for the refugees .
Austria running checks on southern and eastern borders
according to Germany , Austria has once more introduced checks to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Interior Minister , Johann@@ a Mi@@ kl@@ -L@@ ei@@ tn@@ er , stated on the Austrian television channel OR@@ F on Tu@@ es@@ day evening that currently nobody is being sent back to Hungary .
nor has Germany sent any refugees back to Austria .
`` No , that is the agreement , &apos;&apos; she confirmed .
on the question of an agreement about whether a specific number of refugees per day can be taken to go to Germany from Austria , Mi@@ kl@@ -L@@ ei@@ tn@@ er said that discussions on this matter have already been held between the general director for public security and representatives of Germany .
she gave no specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
over the last few days tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria from Hungary over the so-called Balkan route .
most of them are heading to Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel -LRB- CDU -RRB- and her Austrian colleague , W@@ ern@@ er F@@ ay@@ mann , together with a number of other EU states and heads of government , are proposing a special summit for next week .
on Sunday Germany started to impose temporary border controls .
to date the EU states have not been able to agree to a common approach to the crisis .
at a special meeting next Tu@@ es@@ day -LRB- 22 September -RRB- the EU interior ministers want to make a new attempt at a mandatory redistribution of a further 1@@ 20,000 refugees .
in view of the heavy influx of refugees into Germany , the Federal government wants to provide more support to the states with initial rec@@ eption and distribution of people .
the Federal government will manage this jointly with the states , announced Merkel late on Tu@@ es@@ day evening after a discussion lasting almost four hours with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin .
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection will get it .
but those who have no prospects of permanent residen@@ cy will not be able to stay in Germany .
this opinion is also clearly generally shared .
the Chancellor stressed that the country as a whole must now make a `` huge effort . &apos;&apos;
thousands of desperate refugees are currently stuck on the Balkan route .
on Mon@@ day night Hungary closed its 17@@ 5 km long border with Serbia .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that it was also going to se@@ al off the border with Romania with a fence .
unlike Serbia these neighbo@@ uring countries belong to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent people smugg@@ lers finding alternative routes through Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to about the planned new border f@@ ences .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
the first arrests of people who had bre@@ ached the fence have taken place .
in Turkey meanwhile , according to eye@@ witness reports , thousands more migrants are heading for the Greek borders .

an examination revealed that the 2@@ 7-@@ year-old has suffered an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury , the club revealed .
R@@ ama had complained of pain at the beginning of the week .

not a diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic , ju@@ ic@@ y and swe@@ et .

because man@@ goes have a relatively high sugar content - primarily su@@ cro@@ se .
the exotic fruit is nevertheless healthy : they contain B vit@@ am@@ ins as well as vit@@ am@@ ins E and C. But most of all man@@ goes are full of vitamin A and its pre@@ cur@@ sor , be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
eating the fruit boosts the sight , immune system and the body &apos;s metaboli@@ c processes .
when buying man@@ goes they should not be too soft or too firm and they should have a pleasant ar@@ oma .
it is not possible to tell from the c@@ olo@@ ur of the skin how ripe the fruit is - even green man@@ goes can taste deli@@ cious .
they should be kept at room temperature and consumed within a few days .

first a fo@@ eh@@ n storm , then a pronounced cold front
the fo@@ eh@@ n will break through in the val@@ le@@ ys on the nor@@ then side of the Al@@ ps in the coming night , Met@@ e@@ o@@ schwei@@ z announced on Tu@@ es@@ day .
the fo@@ eh@@ n will blow through the Fo@@ eh@@ n val@@ le@@ ys on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day , continuing through the night , sometimes at g@@ ale force .
once the fo@@ eh@@ n has died away on Th@@ urs@@ day morning a prominent cold front will cut across our region , bringing heavy rainfall , gu@@ sty winds and a drop in temperature .
according to Met@@ e@@ o@@ News , Switzerland is currently facing an extensive area of low pressure being brought from the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western flow .
the fo@@ eh@@ n will break through the val@@ le@@ ys on the northern sides of the Al@@ ps during Tu@@ es@@ day night .

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
some 500 years after the Re@@ formation , Rome now has a Martin Luther Square .
in the presence of the Mayor of the City , Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino , a hitherto un@@ named square in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day besto@@ wed with the name of the German reformer .
on the `` Pi@@ az@@ za Martin L@@ ut@@ re@@ o &apos;&apos; he is now recogni@@ sed as the `` German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Re@@ formation . &apos;&apos;
the park is in the centr@@ e of Rome right next to the C@@ olo@@ sse@@ um
the con@@ sortium of Evange@@ li@@ cal churches in Rome proposed the choice of name .
J@@ ens@@ -@@ Martin Kr@@ use , minister of the Evange@@ li@@ cal Lu@@ ther@@ an community in Rome , recalled on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day that for centuries Protestan@@ ts in the Pope &apos;s city often had to hide their faith .
the square is a vi@@ sual symbol that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
as a young August@@ ini@@ an mon@@ k , Martin Luther -LRB- 14@@ 8@@ 3-@@ 15@@ 46 -RRB- stayed in Rome for a few months at the turn of the year between 15@@ 10 and 15@@ 11 .
at the time he considered the city to be a de@@ generate hot@@ bed of vice .
according to historians , his negative im@@ pressions may have been reinforced in his later fight against Rome .
Luther heralded the beginning of the Western Church with his th@@ eses against the selling of indul@@ gences .
talented artist invests three years in his personal interpretation of the Bi@@ ble .
Jesus with the -LRB- Gil@@ ded -RRB- cro@@ wn of thor@@ ns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar A@@ lt has painted for his Bi@@ ble .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written an introduction and updated the text of the Bi@@ ble .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar A@@ lt Bi@@ ble , which has now been issued with magni@@ fic@@ ent pictures .
for Ot@@ mar A@@ lt , who has devised his own personal interpretation of bibli@@ cal stories in 150 mo@@ ti@@ fs on paper and can@@ v@@ as , in the beginning was the picture .
the 7@@ 5-@@ year-old conceived his `` language &apos;&apos; with bright c@@ olo@@ urs and imagin@@ ative forms - which are however by no means synonymous with `` fun@@ ny &apos;&apos; pictures .
on the contrary : depending on the respective themes , they can appear to be thoroughly gloomy .
Ot@@ mar A@@ lt worked on his Bi@@ ble project for around three years and for this project he made a subjec@@ tive choice from an arti@@ stic perspective from the many subject areas in the `` Book of books . &apos;&apos;
cycles evolved , dedicated to topics such as the Way of the Cro@@ ss , pla@@ gues , the Com@@ mand@@ ments or the Lord &apos;s pra@@ yer .
without even approaching them , he immediately att@@ acted multiple partners : this applies to the Luther Ver@@ lag , a publi@@ sher speci@@ alis@@ ing in theological works as well as the K@@ ett@@ ler Ver@@ lag , who focus on publishing art books .
and in particular author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who has grap@@ pled with the particular Bi@@ ble pass@@ ages based on the pain@@ t@@ ings .
he has interpreted the Bi@@ ble texts selected by Ot@@ mar A@@ lt and `` translated &apos;&apos; them to the current day , in a top@@ ical context .
these texts are like verbal mir@@ rors of A@@ lt &apos;s pain@@ t@@ ings .
they are embedded between the original Bi@@ ble quot@@ ations of Martin Luther and each composition by the artist , who has here formulated his own personal concepts for the respective situations .
the dec@@ orated cover of the book is let@@ tered in gold .
the 7@@ 5-@@ year-old allows at the same time a two@@ fold insight , deep into both his soul and his emotions .
this is particularly intim@@ ate .
ultimately , his emotions were the key trigger for the Bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar A@@ lt , who was born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ t order .
`` Education there took place under the shadow of the c@@ ane , &apos;&apos; re@@ members Ot@@ mar A@@ lt .
`` I have tried to process this , so that perhaps I can come to terms with the Lord again .
his second point is that he wants to help art once more to take a more significant place in this fast moving age : `` The perception of the vi@@ sual world today is shaped by advertising , which is loud .
symbolism has been driven out .
artists have a different passion and joy in pres@@ enting things .
pictures always have something mysterious about them ; they are not dec@@ oration .
`` In this respect , I am a d@@ inosa@@ ur . &apos;&apos;
Ot@@ mar A@@ lt wants his viewers to let themselves `` fall into &apos;&apos; the pictures , to let them leave their impression , to discover and experience the power they have : `` The picture is looking for its counterpart . &apos;&apos;
at the launch of the Ot@@ mar A@@ lt Bi@@ ble on Tu@@ es@@ day , Klaus Al@@ te@@ post conf@@ essed to having `` always &apos;&apos; been a lover of Ot@@ mar A@@ lt &apos;s art : `` I like the way he sees life with his pictures . &apos;&apos;
A@@ lt was not interested in rec@@ ording the whole of the Bi@@ ble , selec@@ ting only the the themes which were for him the most significant and also the most mysterious .
`` This was n&apos;t a collaboration between partners , &apos;&apos; says Al@@ te@@ post , `` it was about the pictures ; the text is merely an explanation . &apos;&apos; The result is a picture Bi@@ ble .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Luther Ver@@ lag this work is an invitation `` to add depth to his life and to find freedom . &apos;&apos;
Ot@@ mar A@@ lt &apos;s pictures speak , for M@@ öh@@ ler , the -LRB- bibli@@ cal -RRB- language of love as well as that of responsibility .
some of the origin@@ als - paper and can@@ v@@ as - will be shown for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15@@ th November in the Ot@@ mar A@@ lt Foundation .
start of construction draws closer for BM@@ X track
plans made , site found , company commissioned , mo@@ und for a circu@@ it mod@@ elled : one year later , everything was nearly finished - but even before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was closed again .
political and administrative failings caused anger , particularly with residents who did not want to put up with the track .
so the mo@@ und was demoli@@ shed and the search began for a new site - now with a formal application for planning permission .
approval will be received in October , chief local coun@@ ci@@ ll@@ or Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ bach@@ -@@ Bo@@ ch has now been able to inform the children &apos;s and young people &apos;s committee .
`` I hope that this year something will be seen to happen , &apos;&apos; she said .
the work should then be started without any `` further pause for thought &apos;&apos; at the site of the former in@@ door swi@@ mming pool .
D@@ F@@ B steps up its commitment to refugees
the German football league gave clear indications at the weekend that the D@@ F@@ B is extending its commitment to refugees to 20@@ 19 .
football has reacted to the deteriorating situation in Germany and promised politicians its help with the current problems .
`` I consider this to be the biggest challenge in our country since reunification . &apos;&apos;
`` basically nobody knows , it &apos;s no concern of mine , it &apos;s not my doing . &apos;&apos;
`` It is in the interests of everybody to get to grip with this issue , &apos;&apos; says D@@ F@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ er@@ s@@ b@@ ach .
he wants to debate the subject of the refugee situation in Germany intensi@@ vely at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin .
I &apos;m going to be in the Chancellor &apos;s office next W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day and I &apos;m meeting there with State Minister M@@ S Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &apos;&apos;
`` I &apos;m sure the topic will play a central role there , &apos;&apos; he announ@@ ces .
football can and will help .
but the politicians must set the deciding guidelines .
the German Fo@@ ot@@ ball Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative `` 1 : 0 for a welcome &apos;&apos; to four years .
`` Th@@ rough the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us-@@ Brau@@ n foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 20@@ 19 , &apos;&apos; declared Ni@@ er@@ s@@ b@@ ach on the brink of the U@@ E@@ FA meeting in S@@ t Julian &apos;s , Malta
several teams are also supporting the programme .
this very weekend the 36 professional clubs will be sending out a clear message when they wear the words `` We are helping - # refuge@@ es@@ welcome &apos;&apos; on the left sle@@ eve of their strip instead of the usual spon@@ sor &apos;s lo@@ go -LRB- Her@@ mes -RRB- .
`` We are doing this to make it clear that everyone should help where and in any way they can , &apos;&apos; Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sport boss Rudi V@@ ö@@ ll@@ er told the `` Bild &apos;&apos; newspaper on Tu@@ es@@ day , and describes the scheme as `` a matter of course . &apos;&apos;
`` The refugee drama concerns everyone , nobody can look away . &apos;&apos;
`` We football teams can , no , we must use our charisma , our influence , and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered tremend@@ ously , &apos;&apos; says Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ m &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a prominent signal by the league .
the women &apos;s national team is inv@@ iting 100 refugees to H@@ alle -LRB- Sa@@ ale -RRB- for the World Cup quali@@ fying match against Hungary .
Ni@@ er@@ s@@ b@@ ach describes supporting the refugees as `` a grand joint effort by German football . &apos;&apos;
it is amazing that all 36 licens@@ ed clubs have started their own projects in their own locations .
it is just as amazing that both small and large clubs are doing this .
the message `` 1 : 0 for a welcome , &apos;&apos; that we have sent out is being lived in football .
`` That is of enormous significance , &apos;&apos; he said .
in both this year and next year the association together with the D@@ F@@ B team and the Federal government are making € 300,000 available for the integration of refugees .
`` The clubs have already already released the entire sum for 2015 , &apos;&apos; reports Ni@@ er@@ s@@ b@@ ach .
reports : s@@ ap chief executive loses an eye in accident

`` We are meeting up at the board meeting in W@@ all@@ dor@@ f at the beginning of October , &apos;&apos; said Plat@@ tn@@ er .

Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the `` Süd@@ deutschen Zeitung &apos;&apos; -LRB- Th@@ urs@@ day &apos;s edi@@ tion -RRB- that he will come back to Germany in October and take over the lead at the software group again .
`` I am definitely there for SA@@ P , completely involved in my job . &apos;&apos;
`` I have of course been in regular contact with the board and its chairman , Has@@ so Plat@@ tn@@ er , the whole time , &apos;&apos; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t told the `` SZ . &apos;&apos;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t normally commu@@ tes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he has no longer been in the SA@@ P German headquarters in W@@ all@@ dor@@ f .
II is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager told the `` SZ &apos;&apos; : `` It could happen to anyone . &apos;&apos;
`` The important thing is to get up again if you fall down . &apos;&apos;

ro@@ bot cars : government wants Germany to take a leading role
the Federal Government wants Germany to be technological leaders in changes to cars .
on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day the German cabinet resolved on a policy document introduced by the Minister of Transport Alexander D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt -LRB- CSU -RRB- which provides , among other things , for investment in development of digital infrastructure .
D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt spoke in Frankfurt on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day , on the brink of the IA@@ A motor show , about a `` new era of mobility . &apos;&apos;
autom@@ ated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure fewer traffic j@@ ams , said D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt .
he wants to discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G7 countries , who are also meeting with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A .
the Transport Ministry policy document stressed among other things the importance of the development of mobile broad@@ band and a rapid switch to digital radio .
there is currently a test area on the A@@ 9 mot@@ or@@ way to try out the new technology .
in order that `` no extra liability risk will be imposed &apos;&apos; on drivers , the government wants to `` examine and , where necessary , adapt &apos;&apos; legal parameters to the new developments .
Germany wants to agree on international provisions for the speed limit for dri@@ ver@@ less cars to be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the German government also wants to reach an agreement on changes to the Vienna Convention , which to date only provides for human beings as drivers .
with automatic driving the car increasingly takes control and the driver becomes more and more the passen@@ ger .
the technology is primarily based on sens@@ ors and cameras which capture the environment and process data in sec@@ onds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of the Environment , highly autom@@ ated driving will be technically possible on mot@@ or@@ ways by 2020 .
however dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles `` are not anticipated until 2020 &apos;&apos; on public roads .
the authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly autom@@ ated driving functions in Germany will be around € 8.@@ 4 billion for 2025 .
`` Dig@@ ital net@@ working of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &apos;&apos; says SPD transport politician S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l .
however the issue of liability for accidents and the security of drivers &apos; personal data must be conclu@@ sively clari@@ fied .
and Germans still view dri@@ ver@@ less cars sc@@ epti@@ cally - much more than the French or Americans .
a survey by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the testing organisation Dek@@ ra , presented to the IA@@ A on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ously driven vehicles will catch on in the coming 10 years , 32 percent estimate it will take 20 years and 31 percent do not believe it will happen at all .
in France 21 percent of those asked expect to see autonom@@ ously driven cars by 2025 and in the USA 33 percent .
anyway drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a completely self driven car .
according to a survey by the digital association Bit@@ ko@@ m , only seven percent agree that control should be handed over to the car during the entire journey on all roads .
nevertheless , 15 percent could imagine this happening on mot@@ or@@ ways in free-@@ flowing traffic and 45 percent in traffic j@@ ams .
approximately one in four would never give control to the car under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l not to play in team and doub@@ les in European Champi@@ on@@ ship
as things stand , the D@@ us@@ sel@@ dor@@ f player plans to play only in the sing@@ les in the competition , running from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision will be made on 22 September .
`` It is a major loss for our team . &apos;&apos;
`` The la@@ ds heard about it this morning . &apos;&apos;
`` But we are strong enough to pick up the title without Tim@@ o , &apos;&apos; said national co@@ ach Jörg Ro@@ ss@@ kopf during European Champi@@ on@@ ship training in D@@ us@@ sel@@ dor@@ f .
at this time Bol@@ l was on a flight to a long arran@@ ged appointment with sponsors in China .
the 3@@ 4-@@ year-old German champion is expected back on Fri@@ day .
`` Wi@@ th@@ out Tim@@ o we have the disadvantage of no longer being the clear fa@@ vo@@ ur@@ ites , &apos;&apos; declared individual European champion Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j O@@ v@@ char@@ ov .
but the Ham@@ eli@@ n player , who is the top seed in E@@ k@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also re@@ members the European Champi@@ on@@ ship in Sch@@ wech@@ at in 2013 .
`` We did n&apos;t have Tim@@ o then either , and we still became European Champi@@ ons . &apos;&apos;
`` That is what we need to focus on , &apos;&apos; declared the world number five .
the English football national player Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w , of Manchester , United has sustained a severe injury to his right leg .
in the course of the tackle in the Champi@@ ons League game with P@@ S@@ V Ein@@ dho@@ ven , the defender was hit by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moren@@ o and after a long bout of treatment was replaced .
initial diagnosis indicates that the 20-@@ year-old who used to play with Bas@@ ti@@ an Schwein@@ stei@@ ger has broken his ti@@ bia .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old to be an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ works cham@@ ber of horrors : design@@ er Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier -LRB- 63 -RRB- presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins which look alarmingly human thanks to video projec@@ tion .
they wear the French design@@ er &apos;s spectacular cre@@ ations , which among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and also put men in skir@@ ts .
`` These days I ca n&apos;t say I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te c@@ out@@ ure any longer , because I have white hair . &apos;&apos;
`` It used to be ble@@ ached , nowadays it &apos;s real , &apos;&apos; says Gau@@ l@@ tier .
for visitors to the exhibition , `` F@@ rom the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk , &apos;&apos; which can be seen in the K@@ uns@@ th@@ alle at the H@@ yp@@ o Cul@@ ture Foundation from 1 September , it is fortunate that the fashion design@@ er has changed his initially reluctant attitude to a show about his own character .
originally he was against it because , `` For me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &apos;&apos; he said .
when you die , you get put into a museum .
this remarkable collection has already been staged in Montreal , Canada , and in Paris .
it &apos;s about a lot more than beautiful clothes , &apos;&apos; says the director of the K@@ uns@@ th@@ alle , Ro@@ ger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhi@@ bits provide an insight into the hard to overlook work of the man who wrote the history of fashion without ever having finished his education .
the show is not constructed chron@@ ologi@@ cally , but it is a brilli@@ antly ch@@ ore@@ o@@ graph@@ ed complete work of art which has involved a great deal of effort : for example a sty@@ list has been engaged especially to look after the man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins &apos; hair .
according to cur@@ ator Thi@@ err@@ y-@@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the cre@@ ators car@@ ted 14 t@@ onn@@ es of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of Ok@@ to@@ ber@@ fest there was also a special treat in store : a Le@@ der@@ ho@@ sen out@@ fit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna
he has always been interested in strong women -LRB- `` Women are cle@@ ver@@ er than men &apos;&apos; -RRB- and in people who are a little different , says Gau@@ l@@ tier .
even Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old t@@ ed@@ dy is on show in the exhibition .
he represents the design@@ er &apos;s first , tent@@ ative steps at fashion .
as a child -LRB- he was not a good pu@@ pi@@ l and he was bad at football -RRB- , he dressed his t@@ ed@@ dy in br@@ as and dre@@ sses .
his parents did not allow him to play with doll@@ s .
later he taught himself fashion design .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and scru@@ tin@@ ised other design@@ ers &apos; cre@@ ations , Gau@@ l@@ tier told us in Munich .
of course , later I bought them .
he was not able to pay the models for his first fashion show .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
dec@@ oration instead of cur@@ tains - P@@ lauen lace as a fashion ni@@ che
there used to be long em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y machines in and around P@@ lauen making many met@@ res
of em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered fabri@@ cs and lac@@ es in vast quantities for customers who made , for example , table clo@@ ths and cur@@ tains .
this is no longer the case today , explains Andre@@ as Rein@@ hard@@ t , managing director of Mo@@ desp@@ it@@ ze P@@ lauen .
instead , fashion is once more important .
in the early days of P@@ lauen lace , fashion played a large role , then it was replaced by the home textile industry - and now it is being re@@ discovered as a ni@@ che .
Rein@@ hard@@ t gave a few examples : lace in dec@@ oration , for acc@@ ess@@ ories such as b@@ ags and for traditional co@@ stum@@ es .
generally , so-called vin@@ tage fashion , based on style eras from the past , is producing an increasing potential for orders .
anyone in the textile industry in Germany who can not serve a ni@@ che is no longer in the market .
we are already getting half of all our contracts this way .
Mo@@ desp@@ it@@ ze P@@ lauen , together with nine other businesses , is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze und Sti@@ cker@@ eien trade association .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
sales have fallen by around 80 percent over the last 15 years .
there are now hardly any private speci@@ ality shops or whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers .
our products hardly reach the customers over these channels .
nowadays mass produced goods are manufactured much more cheaply in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
furthermore exports to Russia and the USA are currently weakening slightly .
this is enough reason for new directions .
the trade association is also trying to score with environmental consciousness , as Cor@@ deli@@ a Bau@@ er of Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein explains . `` As of this year we have implemented a se@@ al of quality which shows that our production is ec@@ ologi@@ cally and socially compatible .
Rein@@ hard@@ t added , `` This also applies to the materials we use . &apos;&apos;
qualified design@@ er U@@ te Schmidt teaches in the faculty for applied arts at the Schne@@ eberg branch of the West Sa@@ x@@ ony University of Z@@ wick@@ au and speci@@ alis@@ es in em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y and lace .
in order to face the competition from the Asian regions one has to find high-quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
there is a field of tension between the design@@ ers &apos; newest ideas and businesses , who must think primarily in commercial terms , &apos;&apos; says Schmidt .
this is why existing designs are often only slightly varied in order to keep core customers .
a few years ago textile design@@ er K@@ ati Re@@ uter revit@@ alis@@ ed the historic snow@@ ball lace .
the machines em@@ bro@@ i@@ der small be@@ ads in selected places .
P@@ lauen master g@@ old@@ s@@ mi@@ th Bi@@ anc@@ a H@@ alle@@ bach@@ -@@ Kr@@ auß@@ e was inspired by this . `` In the past I had no use for traditional P@@ lauen lace . &apos;&apos;
now she uses the snow@@ ball lace for her je@@ well@@ ery .
using an elaborate process she em@@ bosses the pattern in silver .
`` Many people in the region identify themselves with P@@ lauen lace - young and old , &apos;&apos; says Re@@ uter .
she also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - primarily to customers whose fore@@ fathers lived in P@@ lauen and the surrounding area and who want to have a mem@@ en@@ to .
so with my je@@ well@@ ery I see myself as a modern ambassador for P@@ lauen lace .
Dis@@ ney plans new `` M@@ ary P@@ opp@@ ins &apos;&apos; film
you should n&apos;t interfere with le@@ gends , but Dis@@ ney is daring to make a new film of the classic `` M@@ ary P@@ opp@@ ins &apos;&apos; anyway .
but according to `` entertainment We@@ ek@@ ly &apos;&apos; it is not going to be a re@@ make but a sort of sequ@@ el , set 20 years after the first film with the magi@@ cal n@@ anny .
it is about the n@@ anny &apos;s experiences with the Bank@@ s family in the time of the Great Depression in England .
who is going to take the role of M@@ ary P@@ opp@@ ins , played 50 years ago by Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws , is not yet certain .
but the director has been decided : ro@@ b Marshall , whose most recent film was `` into the Woods . &apos;&apos;
Xi ur@@ ges to open economy wider to world
the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth , President Xi Jinping told a group t@@ asked with steering reform on Tu@@ es@@ day .
`` China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise , and improve open@@ ing@@ -up policies , &apos;&apos; he said , addressing the 16@@ th Me@@ eting of the Central Le@@ ading Group for deepening overall Reform .
promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality , and provide new room for economic growth , Xi said .
the leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access , relax@@ ation of bor@@ der-@@ control policies , encouraging state-owned enterprises -LRB- SO@@ E -RRB- to absorb private capital and overhau@@ ling the re@@ sident registration system .
according to the statement , a negative list , identifying sectors and businesses that are off-@@ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
the system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs .
the move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources , ensuring a law@@ -based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
the statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in a bid to open up state-controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
`` The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the lawful interests of foreign-@@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &apos;&apos; said the statement .
in addition , it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits , or `` green card , &apos;&apos; by optimi@@ zing requirements and stream@@ lining the application process .
guaranteeing lawyers &apos; right to practice and nurturing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting was also attended by Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang , and senior leaders Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang G@@ a@@ oli , according to a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mercur@@ y limit in predatory fish
the EU commission wants to double the limits for mercur@@ y in large predatory fish and consumers therefore can expect a significantly higher dose of this neur@@ oto@@ x@@ in .
the consumer organisation Fo@@ od@@ watch , to which an EU working paper on the subject was made available , is heavily critical of the plans . `` Ris@@ ks and side effects of inappropriate industry and environmental politics will be passed on with full force to pregnant women and small children , &apos;&apos; declared Mat@@ thi@@ as Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of Fo@@ od@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limits for the neur@@ oto@@ x@@ in for large fish at the end of the food chain such as for example shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are going to be raised from 1 to 2 m@@ g of mercur@@ y per kilogra@@ m of fish for `` economic reasons . &apos;&apos;
large predatory fish however are today so heavily contaminated with mercur@@ y that based on the still current limits some 50 percent of cat@@ ches may not be sold .
once the limit has been doubled , however , only 14@@ .5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ eable .
in return for this relax@@ ation the EU , according to Fo@@ od@@ watch , wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 m@@ g to 0.1 m@@ g of mercur@@ y per kilogra@@ m .
but Fo@@ od@@ watch describes this as a `` trick , &apos;&apos; because smaller prey fish , such as for example car@@ p , generally have so little contamination that these planned maximum levels are already comp@@ lied with today .
the reduction for small fish therefore is `` a per@@ fi@@ dious diversi@@ on@@ ary tactic which helps only the economy , &apos;&apos; declar@@ es Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t .
mercur@@ y is for human beings a highly toxic heavy metal which accumul@@ ates largely in the food chain , above all in predatory fish .
for this reason the German government has issued a warning that `` even low levels , particularly in un@@ born children , can lead to damage to the nervous system . &apos;&apos;
the German Environment Minister , however , declared on his home page with regard to the current maximum levels that a `` health risk to the general population &apos;&apos; is not anticipated .
mercur@@ y is released into the environment primarily through the burning of coal .
German coal plants , according to written information from the German Ministry of the Environment to Green Bundestag member Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck , di@@ schar@@ ge more than six t@@ onn@@ es of mercur@@ y per year , two thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
the concentration of mercur@@ y in fish , for example in the El@@ be , R@@ hin@@ e and D@@ anu@@ be , is `` exten@@ sively exceeded on a long-term basis , &apos;&apos; the `` Spiegel &apos;&apos; newspaper quoted from the paper in March .
in the past year , Europe-wide al@@ er@@ ts on mercur@@ y in fish rated among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ F@@ F .
