a Republican strategy to counter the re @-@ election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
however , the Brenn@@ an Centre considers this a myth , stating that electoral fraud is rar@@ er in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning .
indeed , Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turn @-@ out .
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States .
it is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
this phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 675 new Republican representatives added in 26 States .
as a result , 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone .
the new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship .
furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , invali@@ date the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
before the 2006 elections , no US State required voters to show a photo ID card .
Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement .
in 2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitu@@ tionality of the Indiana law .
the Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States .
over the past two years , they sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card .
it is important to note that , unlike Quebec , American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card .
in fact , 11 % of American citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State .
in addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification .
and it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card .
the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
in fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those earning less than $ 35@@ ,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card .
and that &apos;s not all .
students , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution .
on the other hand , these same States allow fishing or hunting club members , who vote more Republican , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
prior to 2004 , no State required proof of citizenship to vote .
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement .
since 2011 , a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens .
these measures are clearly intended to limit the His@@ panic vote .
however , it appears that two out of three His@@ panic voters favour the Democratic party .
what is more , in 2011 Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States .
in addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register .
these restrictions are not without consequence .
for example , during the 2004 general election , voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens .
however , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
in addition , Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period .
for example , during the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of early voters were African @-@ Americans , who accounted however for only 13 % of voters in the State .
the same applied to Hispan@@ ics .
these represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early .
on the other hand , 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
of course , Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration .
several bills were blocked by vet@@ oes of Democratic governors .
the United States Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws .
they were able to partially limit the damage .
for example , only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card .
however , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influencing the 2012 results in key States .
a 2011 Brenn@@ an Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency .
it is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
but one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turn @-@ out .
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
prostate cancer screening : take the test or not ?
indeed , the P@@ SA test sometimes shows erroneous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions .
enough to make already reluctant men hesitate to take screening tests .
take the test or not ?
we asked two specialists for their opinion .
in studies conducted in the United States , there was a lot of contamination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations .
another study , this time a European one , concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who were not .
this study also showed , with a follow @-@ up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for met@@ ast@@ ases to occur in the absence of screening .
I therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had prostate cancer .
African @-@ American men are also more at risk .
the key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected .
there are aggressive cancers and others that are ind@@ ol@@ ent .
the patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long @-@ term life threatening , and opting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
today , many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
active monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progresses , they will be offered treatment .
more and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
therefore I recommend taking the test .
but the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it .
in collaboration with the Société internationale d &apos;@@ ur@@ ologie &#91; SI@@ U &#93; , Mo@@ v@@ ember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the P@@ SA test .
you can download the document ( in English for the time being , a &#91; French &#93; translation will be available shortly ) at this address : http : / / ca.@@ mo@@ v@@ ember@@ .com / fr / mens @-@ health / prostate @-@ cancer @-@ screening
preventing the disease
unfortunately , there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer .
despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it .
it is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercised enough , 30 % of cancers could be prevented .
&quot; if no more people smoked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , &quot; says André Beau@@ lieu , spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society .
on the other hand , it is estimated that roughly 10 % of cancers are hereditary .
some are also completely un@@ explained .
for the Canadian Cancer Society , the fight against tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smokers .
cigarettes are linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases .
it is also a risk factor for a number of others .
this massively damages people &apos;s health .
&quot; even today , there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec &quot; depl@@ ores spokesperson André Beau@@ lieu .
encouraging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer drops by half .
weight
overweight and obesity are also conducive to the onset of the disease , according to the SC@@ C .
they can increase the risks of cancer of the breast , col@@ on and rec@@ tum , o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , pancreas and uter@@ us .
&quot; research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against col@@ on cancer &quot; it is also said .
diet
the organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat .
in large amounts , it increases the risks of developing colo @-@ rec@@ tal cancer .
likewise , so do cured meat products , and these should be avoided .
the conservation of meat by smoking , drying or curing can cause the formation of carcin@@ ogens .
&quot; they can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer &quot; it is explained .
vitamins
in recent years , a number of scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer .
for the time being however their research is in@@ conclusive .
studies on vitamin E are contradictory , according to the SC@@ C .
while one study noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer , another noted an increase .
also the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear .
in addition , Mr Beau@@ lieu emphasises the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor .
&quot; taking a screening test doesn &apos;t give you cancer . &quot;
the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son revealed
the announcement of the probable discovery of the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son created quite a stir last summer , and with good reason .
indeed , it is believed that this bo@@ son is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe , no less .
also it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best or &quot; less worse &quot; explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empi@@ rically .
but for physi@@ cists , it is still not completely sure that it really is the Hig@@ gs .
we know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic particle , and greatly resembles the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son predicted by the Standard Model .
in addition , new data unveiled this week at a large physics Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure .
but let &apos;s suppose that it really is the Hig@@ gs , since the chances of being mistaken seem slim , and see what it is .
in our world , there is a fat@@ ally unavoidable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time .
there &apos;s no way to break this rule - and don &apos;t try too hard , you &apos;ll go mad .
however , even though particle physics is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the Pauli exclusion principle , which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot; quantum state &quot; - this &quot; state &quot; consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics .
based on this , physi@@ cists classify particles into two categories .
in one corner we have good citizens called fer@@ mi@@ ons , who wisely obey the Pauli principle .
while lur@@ king in the other are the bo@@ sons , a nasty band of anarch@@ ists who respect nothing - at all events , not this principle , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time .
these bo@@ sons are then divided into two groups , according to the Berkeley Labs Par@@ ticle Adventure site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : mes@@ ons , which we will not discuss here , and &quot; force particles &quot; by which the great forces of nature are propag@@ ated and to which the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son may be somehow related .
these bo@@ sons , it must be stressed here , are not all such exotic bugs as you might think .
in fact , if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal bo@@ son : the phot@@ on , or the &quot; light particle &quot; which is the &quot; messenger &quot; of the electromagnetic force .
when , in fact , a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction , this &quot; distur@@ bs &quot; the electromagnetic field in this specific place , rather like a pebble thrown in a pond .
this &quot; disturbance &quot; produces an electromagnetic wave ( of light , infrared , ultra@@ violet etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a phot@@ on - and thus one of the &quot; force carrier &quot; bo@@ sons .
more stable field
the same applies to the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son , with the difference that it is another field , the Hig@@ gs field , which must be &quot; disturbed &quot; for the bo@@ son to appear .
now , this Hig@@ gs field is much , much more stable than the electromagnetic field ; to exc@@ ite it , it is necessary to achieve very , very high energy levels , rather like a frozen pond which would need a very large rock to wrin@@ kle the surface .
which is why a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Had@@ ron Col@@ lider is a ring with a 27@@ km circum@@ ference ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels .
the analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Hig@@ gs and mass .
in fact not all particles , or all materials , interact with the electromagnetic field .
some , such as magnets , do so , but others don &apos;t - a piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a fridge .
and likewise , not all particles interact with the Hig@@ gs field : those that do so have mass , while the others ( such as the phot@@ on ) do not .
now , what is it that all this research &quot; can bring &quot; ? asks Ms P@@ lam@@ ond@@ on .
for science , it serves to check the validity of the Standard Model ( SM ) , and also allows physicians to examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of the SM .
a number of people , moreover , fer@@ v@@ ently hope that some will be found , because the slightest difference could open a door to a &quot; new physics &quot; and plug certain holes in the Model .
this , it must be said , still has huge shortcomings , offering no explanation for gravity ( o@@ ops ! ) or dark matter , which forms approximately 80 % of the matter in the Universe ( re @-@ o@@ ops ! ) .
but to date no such discrepancies have been found at CERN .
repercussions
the repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume that there won &apos;t be any .
remember : in the very early 60s , the pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that would be triggered by their work .
they had an in@@ kling of the scientific applications , but nothing as to the rest .
in fact , the late Will@@ ard Bo@@ yle - a physicist who worked at Bell Labs , where the laser was invented in 1960 , and who himself developed the first continuous laser ( the first were pul@@ sed ) in 1962 - told us that initially the laser was rather seen as a &quot; lab gad@@ get . &quot;
just imagine ...
and then , applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research .
for example , the same Will@@ ard Bo@@ yle developed a small light sensor in 1969 , during his work in optics .
this sensor , although this was not at all the original intention , now serves as an &quot; eye &quot; to all digital cameras worldwide , and earned him the Nobel physics prize in 2009 .
this does not of course mean that the activities of the L@@ HC will necessarily transform our lives , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ...
pal@@ li@@ ative care - The best way to die ... &#124; Le Dev@@ oir
with its D@@ ying with D@@ ign@@ ity Commission , Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life .
the debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared .
however , in this vital area , much remains to be done .
le Dev@@ oir attempted to look more closely .
just a few weeks ago Mr L. lived alone in his Mont@@ é@@ ré@@ gie apartment .
the fes@@ tering prostate cancer had allowed him a two @-@ year respite .
&quot; they gave me five years to live , I &apos;ve made it to seven , &quot; he says , with mixed emotions , lying in his bed at the Victor @-@ Gad@@ bois pal@@ li@@ ative care home in Bel@@ o@@ eil , where he arrived the previous day .
&quot; but it &apos;s still a shock , you can never be prepared for it &quot; he adds .
the disease is doing its work : huge weakness which prevents him going to the toilet alone , and even eating alone .
sitting in front of an appeti@@ sing lunch , he cons@@ ents to being helped to eat , resigned .
courageous , he even manages to smile , talks to the strangers bustling around him , bringing him his medication , offering him a bath .
the courage of ordinary death .
&quot; what I want most is to be cured of my diar@@ rho@@ ea , it &apos;s humiliating &quot; he confi@@ ded .
a few hours later , the team found a cure for this illness .
&quot; during our lives , we learn that a man p@@ isses standing up , &quot; says Pierre Bro@@ deur , psychologist at the Victor @-@ Gad@@ bois home .
regres@@ sing to the stage of a child , for some people , is an unacceptable humiliation .
&quot; it depends on the person &apos;s ability &quot; to accept the regression , he says .
because , in the opinion of a number of people working in pal@@ li@@ ative care , great moments occur at the very heart of such regression .
patients at the Victor @-@ Gad@@ bois pal@@ li@@ ative care home all suffer from cancer .
they have a maximum life expectancy of three months .
at this stage , the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so @-@ called &quot; curative &quot; care .
for Mrs A. , 89 years old , the worst fear is to die &quot; conscious and suffoc@@ ating . &quot;
but the disease has made me discover my children .
&quot; I have fine children &quot; she adds .
&quot; I don &apos;t wish for anything more in life &quot; she says , before accepting having a mask put on to help her breathe .
she looks forward nevertheless , in the next few days , to a last visit by her son coming from Italy .
at Victor @-@ Gad@@ bois , a group of volunteers provides bodily care and help with feeding .
this is pal@@ li@@ ative care , given when there is nothing else that can be done .
to make death more comfortable .
in Quebec , there are pal@@ li@@ ative care beds for 11,@@ 700 inhabitants .
this is very few when we know that we will all die one day .
here , life continues under the best possible conditions , explains Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , one of the doctors at the home .
whether at a physical comfort , emotional or spiritual level .
a person who is dying will accept being helped to drink brand@@ y or Pep@@ si , whatever is their ti@@ pple .
di@@ abe@@ tics no longer need to control their blood sugar .
and death is part of everyday life .
yesterday evening , a beer was served to Mr X , who died during the night .
this morning , it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased .
&quot; we help relatives as much as patients &quot; says Nath@@ alie Sav@@ ard , Director of Care .
at the Victor @-@ Gad@@ bois home , one day follows another but no two are alike .
along with a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who is sav@@ ouring his last meeting with his family , sitting firmly wed@@ ged in his pillows while to@@ asts are drunk in his honour , a 36 @-@ year @-@ young man is dying tragically , surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive .
&quot; for six months , there have always been three to five beds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old &quot; says a concerned Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel .
53 % of patients admitted to the Victor @-@ Gad@@ bois home come from their homes , 47 % from hospital .
lack of access to pal@@ li@@ ative care
it is said that 77 % of Canadi@@ ans simply have no access to pal@@ li@@ ative care , which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care home .
and a number of organisations , such as the Victor @-@ Gad@@ bois home and the Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Society in Greater Montreal , specialise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients .
it is precisely this large gap in Quebec health care which has made a number of pal@@ li@@ ative care physicians fear the adoption of a law on euthan@@ asia and assisted suicide .
since October , a manifesto , signed by pal@@ li@@ ative care lumin@@ aries including Dr Bal@@ four Mount and Dr Bernard La@@ poin@@ te , has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative .
according to Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality pal@@ li@@ ative care before it is accepted to proceed to euthan@@ asia .
recently , she says , I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to ease her suffering .
I &apos;m afraid that patients ask to die because they don &apos;t receive adequate care .
and at the same time , some on@@ colo@@ gi@@ sts work relentlessly on their patients until the last day , despite the worst progno@@ ses .
H@@ él@@ ène Richard &apos;s survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gru@@ elling chem@@ otherapy .
when I announced to my onc@@ ologist that I was stopping the treatment , she told me she regretted that I had given up fighting , she said .
however , she had told me I was finished !
no all @-@ powerful care
Dr Mar@@ tel believes that 90 % of patients asking to die thank care @-@ gi@@ vers for not having acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a pal@@ li@@ ative care team .
but it must be said that pal@@ li@@ ative care is not absolutely all @-@ powerful in the treatment of pain .
according to El@@ sie Mon@@ er@@ eau , Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Director with the Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Society in Greater Montreal , patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases .
at the very end of life , physicians then often resort to pal@@ li@@ ative sed@@ ation , which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death , either spor@@ a@@ dically or permanently .
we can no longer pretend not to understand this part of their suffering .
increasingly , an un@@ relieved patient will have the option of having such pal@@ li@@ ative sed@@ ation .
patients who are not relieved always say the same thing : &quot; I want to die . &quot;
but this does not necessarily mean &quot; I want you to euthan@@ ise me , &quot; it means &quot; I want to be relieved . &quot;
this report was made possible thanks to a journalism award from the Canada health research institutes .
widespread real estate scandals in Quebec
day after day highway officials , building contractors , political party fund @-@ rais@@ ers and Italian mafia specialists tell what they know of a formidable &quot; system , &quot; combining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade unionists and organised crime .
an &quot; industry &quot; which has cost Quebec taxpayers dearly , especially in the 1990s and 200@@ 0s .
&quot; it is curious how the system is crum@@ bling since we took drastic measures &quot; says Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au ironically , a Quebec politician and former Montreal Chief of Police .
it was through him that the scandal broke in 2011 , in an in @-@ depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Quebec , to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time , Jean Char@@ est , had cons@@ ented only reluctantly .
the &quot; Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au report &quot; established a direct link between industry , under @-@ the @-@ table financing of parties and bri@@ bery of officials .
&quot; since the inquiry opened in 2010 , he says , the Ministry of Transport alone reportedly saved a billion dollars on contracts , &quot; with certain people curbing their instincts to get a share !
the Char@@ bon@@ ne@@ au Commission &quot; has already brought down two mayors &quot; he adds , hoping that it will succeed in &quot; revealing the schemes behind the individuals . &quot;
a permanent anti @-@ corruption unit , created in 2011
the Permanent Anti @-@ Cor@@ ruption Unit , created in 2011 , is also coupled with its army of government analysts , investigators , and auditors .
plus the &quot; mar@@ teau squad &quot; policemen who , since 2009 , have apparently led the Montreal &quot; se@@ wer cartel &quot; to soft pedal on the inflation of contracts ...
in recent weeks , it has conducted a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians , such as Frank Z@@ amp@@ ino and Richard Mar@@ cot@@ te , Mayor of a suburban town .
next on the list is apparently Gilles V@@ ail@@ lan@@ court , who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval , third largest city in Quebec .
he is suspected of po@@ ck@@ eting repeated bri@@ bes in exchange for public contracts .
others formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrepreneurs , including Tony Ac@@ cur@@ so and Lin@@ o z@@ ambi@@ to .
the latter caused a sensation by explaining the mechanics of the public contracts &quot; system &quot; to the commission .
he himself paid 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who in turn paid the money to Union Montréal , Mayor Gér@@ ald Tre@@ mb@@ lay &apos;s party .
Mr z@@ ambi@@ to has handed money out freely in the 200@@ 0s , giving over 88@@ ,000 Canadian dollars ( roughly 68@@ ,000 euros ) to provincial parties , especially the Liberals then in power .
he also admitted having organised an illegal fund@@ ra@@ iser for former Liberal Deputy @-@ Prime Minister , Nath@@ alie Norman@@ deau .
se@@ wer contracts with inflated costs
in Montreal , the corruption &quot; system &quot; ran smoothly .
Gilles sur@@ pren@@ ant , former public works engineer , described it in detail in front of the commission : in ten years , he received from construction companies gifts , invitations to trips , golf tournaments , restaurants , hockey matches and bri@@ bes totalling 7@@ 36@@ ,000 dollars , in exchange for se@@ wer contracts of which he inflated the costs .
other highway officials admitted having their palms gre@@ ased by infl@@ ating invoices by 30 to 40 % , and by false add @-@ ons .
then an organiser of the Mayor &apos;s party , Martin Dum@@ ont , accused Mr Tre@@ mb@@ lay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money .
following these revelations , Mr Tre@@ mb@@ lay resigned in early November , plung@@ ing Montreal into a major crisis .
Ch@@ antal Rou@@ leau was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the alarm .
Mayor of the borough of Ri@@ vi@@ ère @-@ des @-@ Pra@@ i@@ ries , to the East of the island , she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and res@@ old for ... 1.6 million to developers , at the height of the real estate boom .
70 % dirty money in election campaigns
on the investigation which will eventually be implemented , she says she &quot; is following a thread in order to find out how the system - infiltr@@ ated by ants - works , to put a stop to the gan@@ gr@@ ene and catch the culprits . &quot;
the process , she says , is &quot; painful but positive . &quot;
the wound is being cleaned , but Montreal would need its own investigative unit with ongoing monitoring , to avoid the return of these questionable practices .
how to clean house .
properly .
Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au notes for his part that &quot; officials st@@ ole hundreds of millions of dollars , &quot; but he is especially concerned about the role of &quot; elected people aware of the scheme , &quot; when they were not up to their nec@@ ks in the sc@@ am !
estimating the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec at 70 % , he says dr@@ y@@ ly : &quot; I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality . &quot;
the Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars , but this will not change the situation , he says : &quot; until election expenses are strictly limited , there will be dirty money in politics . &quot;
he advocates a complete overhaul of the system for granting public contracts and party funding : &quot; we can &apos;t go any lower ; getting to the bottom of things , with courage , will help to rebuild the house on more solid foundations , with more controls and laws . &quot;
although this story tarn@@ ishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal , Mr Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au invites anyone laughing to look in their own backyard ...
&quot; PS@@ G is not FC Barcelona ! &quot;
this season , you have taken on a new stature with PS@@ G .
how do you explain this progression ?
it can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PS@@ G .
some great players have arrived .
every day I &apos;m making progress alongside them .
the technical staff has also brought me a lot .
day by day , all these things help me raise my level of play .
and , in a match , it &apos;s easier .
everything moves very fast in football .
but I don &apos;t get worked up .
from my debut at the Cla@@ i@@ ref@@ on@@ taine IN@@ F pre @-@ training centre to my transfer to Saint @-@ Etienne , I &apos;ve always moved step by step .
so you benefit from the competition brought in by Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti ...
this summer &apos;s recru@@ its are used to playing matches at a high level .
they also know that every training session is crucial .
which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best .
on the other hand , Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti gives me a lot as regards my position .
he &apos;s supported by dep@@ uties like Claude Mak@@ el@@ ele , who played in the same position as me .
is An@@ cel@@ otti the man for the job ?
definitely .
An@@ cel@@ otti inspires respect among all the experts .
today he has no equal in Lig@@ ue 1 , and he &apos;s one of the best coaches in Europe .
he has masses of experience and has won many titles with top clubs .
he &apos;s worked with great players .
I think he will bring more titles to Paris .
in January , I had an encouraging discussion with him .
I was just coming back from a series of injuries .
the confidence he gives me also explains my performance .
what importance do you attach to the first part of the season for PS@@ G ?
in Lig@@ ue 1 , Lyon over@@ took us at the top .
but we &apos;re waiting on the sidelines .
one of our main goals is the Champions League : we qualified for the last 16 in the right way .
what is the club &apos;s goal in this competition ?
we &apos;ll try to go as far as possible .
from now on , anything can happen .
but we &apos;ll have something to say against some very good European teams .
first of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of Porto , to have home advantage in the last 16 match .
can PS@@ G become a top European club in the short term ?
it already has the budget ...
to become a top European club , Paris needs to win titles and keep it up over time .
today , this isn &apos;t the case .
financially , PS@@ G has the means to make it happen .
in Lig@@ ue 1 , would not winning the title , like last season , be a big failure ?
definitely , it would be a major disappointment .
this year , we &apos;re really committed to winning the championship .
we weren &apos;t far away last season .
in May , there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first .
it was a terrific season .
we finished with 79 points .
normally , 79 points is good enough to be top ...
but another team , Montpellier , had an even more fantastic season .
I think this is the year .
even if big teams like Marseille , Lyon and Bordeaux are competing for the title , I think we have the weapons to win .
do you think the media expect too much of PS@@ G ?
it &apos;s normal for them to expect a lot from us given what &apos;s been invested and the players we have .
we totally accept it .
after we won 4 @-@ 0 at home against Tro@@ yes and they still found things to blame us for , that &apos;s definitely a bit frustrating .
you wonder what more people expect .
you &apos;re never going to win 4 @-@ 0 every weekend .
we &apos;re not FC Barcelona !
we &apos;re trying to implement a game project .
it takes time to build a team .
the Champions League proved we could hold our own .
look at Manchester City who , for two seasons , have failed to qualify for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts !
based on the amounts invested , you should be 15 points ahead at the winter break !
that would be to ignore our opponents and the French Championship .
Lyon and Marseille , who were no good last season , were &quot; boosted &quot; by the new PS@@ G .
this shows that Lig@@ ue 1 is exciting .
I hope that in May we will be able to smile in saying that , despite all the difficulties , we finally did it .
PS@@ G seem totally dependent on the exploits of Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ovic .
so much so that people say there is a &quot; Zlat@@ an dependence . &quot;
this means Ibra@@ him@@ ovic is very successful and scores a lot of goals .
that &apos;s why he came , and he &apos;s proving he &apos;s the star of Lig@@ ue 1 .
he &apos;s demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player , a world star .
within the group , we respect the man and the player .
and also he respects the men he has around him .
what he has done is truly exceptional .
it pushes others to raise their level of play .
Thi@@ ago Silva , who is one of the best defenders in the world , also helps everyone else progress .
how did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team ?
a disappointment .
I really wanted to play in this Euro .
unfortunately , my injury prevented me from getting any game time .
I saw some things there and came out stronger .
today , I &apos;m playing well in selection matches .
which is what I &apos;ve been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues .
I &apos;ve learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now owe it to myself to have exemplary behaviour .
what do think about Di@@ dier Des@@ champs &apos;s first few months in charge of the Blues ?
he has the results he wanted .
we &apos;re well placed in the World qualifying group .
the coach is tough , close to the players , and inspires them to win .
like Laurent Blanc was .
but I don &apos;t want to make any comparisons .
Blanc had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro .
I hope Di@@ dier Des@@ champs will take the Blues to Brazil .
did the good draw ( 1 @-@ 1 ) snat@@ ched in Spain , on 16 October , represent a founding match ?
that match gave us confidence .
everybody fought for everybody .
before that shock in Spain , I &apos;d never experienced such a match in my career .
with Bit@@ coin , pay and sell without banks
the opposite of current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved .
in addition , as often in these technologies , a political vision is palp@@ able : the belief that the current monetary system , made up of banking monopolies , leads to financial crises .
in fact , Bit@@ coin , invented by Sat@@ o@@ shi Nak@@ am@@ oto ( a pseu@@ donym ) , is both a virtual currency ( but convertible into dollars , euros ) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent , which allows peer @-@ to @-@ peer file exchange .
around 200,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15,000 computers on the network .
close to a thousand web sites accept bit@@ coins as donations or means of payment .
the Bit@@ coin exchange rate , after reaching a peak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in June 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , returning today to around a dozen dollars ( rates are listed on the bit@@ co@@ in@@ char@@ ts@@ .com site ) .
nothing very impressive , compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products .
however , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October .
it describes Bit@@ coin as &quot; the most successful virtual currency , &quot; &quot; in competition with the dollar or the euro &quot; and &quot; similar to conventional currencies . &quot;
Bit@@ coin differs from other types of virtual currency such as &apos; credits &apos; , used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy ( and sometimes exchange in return ) .
the social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system .
but , on each occasion , a central authority controls and handles the exchanges .
with Bit@@ coin , all nodes in the network are both custodi@@ ans of the book of accounts , auditors , currency issuers , and buyers and sellers .
how does the network operate ?
each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e @-@ mail .
except that a user can choose a different address for each payment , thereby ensuring anonymity .
a set of information associated with this transaction is signed electronically by a dual @-@ key encryption system .
so the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction .
using the contents of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bit@@ coins exist in the public book of accounts , broadcast across the entire network .
the key step is entering the new transaction in the book .
it passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge issued to the computers , and the winner , a kind of interim central banker , will have the privilege of adding this extra line .
this is a file h@@ ashing phase , i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital imprint .
computers &quot; take &quot; the new transaction and add a number to it , then &quot; hash &quot; it all up .
the goal being to find the number that gives a special imprint ( lots of zer@@ os at the beginning ) .
once this number has been found , the other nodes can easily check that it is the right one .
the transaction is then in@@ destruc@@ ti@@ bly linked to the chain of all the other transactions ; any modification would alter the imprint .
if a user wanted to de@@ fraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly ( less than ten minutes ) , only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other would remain an orphan because the two have different im@@ prints .
the computer that resolves the challenge wins 50 bit@@ coins .
to avoid inflation , this award is regularly divided by two , probably by the end of 2012 .
the number of bit@@ coins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are di@@ visible down to the hundred million@@ th , which leaves some margin ...
the difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computing power .
the life of the network has had its ups and downs .
websites providing services for Bit@@ coin have been attacked and bit@@ coins in deposits stolen .
&quot; the loophole used is not the protocol itself &quot; says Pierre No@@ iz@@ at re@@ assur@@ ingly , who has just launched Pay@@ mium , a real currency payment company that uses the Bit@@ coin network .
the ECB also highlights the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service .
but cash also has this weakness .
major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature .
others , such as the WordPress blog platform , accept them .
recently , A@@ di Sham@@ ir and Dor@@ it Ron , from the Weiz@@ mann Institute in Israel , analysed the accounting books and showed that almost 80 % of bit@@ coins do not circulate .
in November , &quot; huge sell @-@ offs &quot; were launched .
&quot; thirty thousand dollars were exchanged &quot; welcomes Jon Hol@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , who works for Co@@ in@@ ab@@ ul , which converts bit@@ coins to gold .
Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , also author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network .
his system , Pay@@ t@@ unia , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real money ) or a contac@@ tless payment by mobile , but it uses Bit@@ coin to validate transactions , which are thus cheaper .
also the user manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous .
the system is easy to implement by merchants , who do not need to install new terminals or software .
they just need to provide an address that a phone can &quot; photograph and recognise &quot; says Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , who confirms he has thousands of users .
there is a general movement to re@@ app@@ raise hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems .
&quot; it will take time for Bit@@ coin to become firmly established , but 2013 could be a turning point , &quot; he predic@@ ts .
the ECB , in its report , says it will re@@ assess the various risks , currently regarded as high , in the event of the currency &apos;s success .
we got out of Afghanistan .
what now ?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( Kap@@ isa and Sur@@ ob@@ i ) .
NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014 .
it is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future , without expecting us to do everything .
it is mainly Afghan peasants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists .
and ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the wounded , the ma@@ im@@ ed .
the Taliban is composed of foreign extremists , former leaders in refuge in Pakistan , but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces , like in the time of the Soviets .
they want to defend their traditions , both ancient and archaic , even though they have been joined by Ji@@ hadi@@ sts , Pakist@@ anis , Arabs , Uz@@ be@@ ks , Ta@@ ji@@ ks .
tolerated , sometimes assisted , by local insurgents , the latter will no longer be so when Western@@ ers become more scarce .
the departure of French troops from the Ni@@ j@@ r@@ ab base , which I observed from the top of hills of almond trees planted with French funding , was carried out in an orderly fashion .
con@@ voys of trucks and armo@@ ured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked , over@@ flown by helicopters .
there will be no wave of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014 .
circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996 .
at that time Kabul was empty , the country being torn apart by the struggles between different factions .
their takeover of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liberation , a return to safety .
Afghan@@ is paid the price of the obscur@@ anti@@ sm of these peasants by the organisation of Al @-@ Qaeda , but their situation has not improved today .
former Mu@@ jah@@ i@@ din , the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are allied in the desire to keep women in an inferior position .
the main anti @-@ Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001 .
they became profit@@ eers , seizing government land to res@@ ell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting from huge American outsourcing contracts .
they have become discredited ; what is more , most of them did not fight themselves .
the people , as I heard in the countryside , want a Government that is not made up of thieves .
many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from American lar@@ ges@@ se will leave : the flight of capital is considerable .
the young people are tired of war and its ideologies .
they have rub@@ bed shoulders with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan , and appreciated the benefits .
roughly 65 % of the population is less than 25 ; Kabul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the total population .
in towns and cities , the state schools are full , with girls and boys alike .
it will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obscur@@ anti@@ sm of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders .
all of them , including the armed opponents , are partial to mobile phones ; television , with its Turkish soap operas that show a modern world , is followed everywhere .
the army is now present .
will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate ?
former commanders of the anti @-@ Soviet struggle are already thinking about restoring provincial militias , which will escape the central power .
Afghanistan , land of mountains , with strong local identities , should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation , in the image of the Western nations , but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralised State , with strong presidential power , abolishing the post of Prime Minister , which had existed since the 1964 Constitution .
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls , particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014 .
but , since the 50s and already well before , his country has been dependent on foreign aid .
no industries have been re @-@ established , no dams are in good condition , no major irrigation systems have been repaired .
everything is imported ; nothing is produced , apart from fruit and vegetables .
the Pri@@ ority is left to private initiative .
in a country ruined by thirty years of war , government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary .
the rum@@ our was spread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth .
this only added to the feeling that the Western@@ ers were only there to seize it .
with no energy to process the iron ore or copper on site , or means of transport to export it across the mountains , there is no mining .
the Chinese have already almost left the M@@ es A@@ yn@@ ak copper mine , leaving international archae@@ ologists ( funded by the World Bank ) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province .
one day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , on which imports and exports largely depend , to restore normal relations .
the departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November .
the new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls &apos; high school , boys &apos; high school , French Department at the University , French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and agricultural fields , support to the archaeological Delegation .
since 2009 , to try to &quot; win hearts and minds &quot; and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions , a &quot; civil @-@ military actions &quot; service from the Ministry of defence ( Cim@@ ic ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a small French NGO , many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in dozens of mountain villages .
these projects , involving large numbers of local labour , have helped to contain the insurgency : irrigation , wells , drinking water , re@@ forestation , fruit trees , soil protection and increase in cultiv@@ able areas .
what will we leave as a souvenir , after two billion euros of military spending ?
a much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions , which are very hard in these valleys often located over 2,000 metres above sea level .
the Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in Kap@@ isa province .
to be in a position to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups , which is what farmers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour , well controlled and directly affecting them .
a Constitution by force in Egypt
a new gamble for President Mohammed Morsi .
while Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration , which temporarily grants him full powers , he has decided to go for broke .
taking everyone by surprise , he announced on Wednesday that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day .
just a week ago , the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work .
for two years Egypt has relied on a provisional text , amended several times and this has weakened institutional stability and led to legal im@@ bro@@ gli@@ os .
this new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country .
according to his opponents , the President is persever@@ ing in his &quot; autocratic deli@@ rium , &quot; continuing to &quot; go back on his word &quot; and &apos; tr@@ ample the law . &quot;
his supporters affirm that this is the quickest way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis , by speeding up the transition process .
a referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks .
a very short period , which forces the Brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text , article by article , to the Egyptians .
for the President , it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute ra@@ ges throughout the country .
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote favourably , as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time .
particularly since a hasty vote sm@@ acks of an ultim@@ atum to the Egyptian people : &quot; either you vote for my text , or I keep full powers , &quot; these powers supposedly exp@@ iring following adoption of the Constitution .
it was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constitu@@ ent Assembly , with a large Islamist majority , voted on the text yesterday .
most of the liberals were missing .
in mid @-@ November , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had sl@@ ammed the door , feeling they had failed to assert their views .
representatives of human rights , religious minorities or civil society had done likewise .
in order to obtain a quorum , 11 members , altern@@ ates , were hastily added yesterday morning .
some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood .
not surprisingly , the articles were for the most part voted unanimously .
commentators were also am@@ used that one of the only di@@ versions of the day was expressed with regard to ... the hour of prayer , some Committee members feeling that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly clock was wrong .
the text , which was still being voted on yesterday evening , has 234 articles .
the main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 1971 Constitution , stipulating that &quot; the principles of sh@@ aria are the main source of law . &quot;
the Sal@@ af@@ ist parties , for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim , were hoping to replace &quot; the principles &quot; by &quot; the rules , &quot; which would have allowed stricter application .
for the Islamists , the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society .
&quot; hypocrisy &quot; respond the liberals , who see only a communication coup .
because in their opinion Islam@@ isation of the Constitution is done through other articles .
they refer in particular to article 220 , which grants Al @-@ Az@@ har University an advisory role , with particular reference to verifying the conformity of the laws with sh@@ aria .
according to Egypt specialist Sophie Pomm@@ ier , this is worrying because &quot; the people called upon to advise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy .
this suggests the beginnings of a the@@ ocracy . &quot;
the liberals &apos; fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next Rec@@ tor of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one .
&quot; for the time being , there is no concrete religious implication .
with this Constitution , things remain under civil rule .
most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law scholars but academics , some trained in the French system &quot; qualifies Alexis Bl@@ ou@@ et , who is writing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition .
but he acknowledges that &quot; there may be some ambiguity regarding article 220 , because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary .
reference is made in particular to &quot; fi@@ q@@ h &quot; &#91; Islamic jurisprudence , Editor &apos;s note &#93; .
and the question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent to pronounce on it . &quot;
beyond its religious aspect , the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic .
the Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime .
another issue : the powers conferred on the army .
in accordance with the wishes of the military , the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament , but to a National Defence Council .
nor will trials of civilians will be banned in military tribunals , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights .
who also voice their concerns about the text , which they consider repressive .
the offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited , which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression , particularly for the press .
in addition , no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women , highlights H@@ EBA Mor@@ ay@@ ef , from Human Rights Watch .
in her opinion , the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36 .
the word was not included in the previous Constitution .
while the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon .
supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday .
in Israel , holy places await Ukrainian tourists , the omp@@ hal@@ os and a sea of sal@@ ine water
the Holy Land combines the splendour of biblical truths , modern comfort and prim@@ eval nature .
A@@ IF &#91; Argum@@ enti i Fak@@ ti &#93; newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel .
let &apos;s worship the holy places
it is worth visiting the River Jordan where Jesus was baptized .
it is considered that all who enter this baptism &quot; bath &quot; are blessed by God .
Galil@@ ee is the place where Jesus performed his magic : turned water into wine at a wedding , walked on water , cal@@ med a storm , and filled the nets .
this is also where Jesus came before his disciples and after the resurrection .
but the biggest number of holy places is in Jerusalem .
believers walk through the Way of Gri@@ ef or Via Dol@@ or@@ osa .
it starts by the Ant@@ onia Fortress - Praet@@ orium - where the judgement took place , and brings us along the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Holy Sep@@ ul@@ ch@@ re on Gol@@ go@@ tha - the place of the cruci@@ fix@@ ion , Stone of un@@ ction and the place of Jesus &apos; burial .
this is also the location of the symbolic Christian omp@@ hal@@ os , which symbo@@ lizes the salvation of mankind .
the Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem is erected at the site that , according to Christian legend , yielded the tree used to make the cross for Jesus &apos; cruci@@ fix@@ ion .
Jerusalem has the most holy places for the Jews as well - the W@@ ailing Wall , which remained from a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD .
according to tradition , people of different fai@@ ths leave notes here with their wishes , which are then fulfilled .
travel along a vertical
ruins of the Mass@@ ada Fortress remain from a secret refuge from enemies , built by Her@@ od in 25 BC for his family .
they are located on cliffs in the mountains at an elevation of 450 m above sea level .
they can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain climbing .
others are delivered to this historical mountain@@ top by a cableway .
in the north of the country , at an elevation of 1600 @-@ 20@@ 40 m , there is a famous ski resort called Her@@ mon , which fills up with tourists in winter months .
a shuttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain .
the total length of ski pistes is 45 km .
according to an ancient legend , pag@@ an gods used to live on the mountain .
visit unique museums
this country has about 300 museums .
you won &apos;t be able to visit all of them on one trip
but at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit .
among them - Museum of Israel , located close to Knesset ( Parliament ) .
it has ancient Q@@ um@@ ran manuscripts and Dead Sea sc@@ rolls found in the caves of the Ju@@ dean desert , along with about 500,000 archaeological and anthropo@@ logical artefacts .
the Museum of Art in Tel @-@ Aviv is also interesting .
its exhibits include a wide range of impression@@ ists and expres@@ sion@@ ists like Mon@@ et , P@@ iss@@ arro , Reno@@ ir , Sis@@ ley , C@@ ez@@ anne , M@@ atis@@ se , Mo@@ dig@@ li@@ ani , Cha@@ gall , Picasso .
in Ak@@ ko , you can visit the bath museum Al @-@ Bas@@ ha , which consists of several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bath atten@@ dants of the time .
in Caes@@ area , it is worth visiting the unique private Ral@@ li Museum , where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Rodin .
there are no tour guides or gift shops .
entry is free of charge , and contributions are strictly not allowed .
the fifth one is the Holocaust Museum or Y@@ ad V@@ ash@@ em in Tel @-@ Aviv , which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history .
the most tragic section is the children &apos;s memorial , built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers .
you go in and find yourself in complete darkness .
stars are glim@@ mering ,
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they died .
Ukraine is mentioned there too .
wellness
there are three resort areas in Israel , located on the coasts of the Mediterranean , Red , and Dead Seas .
each have swimming pools , aqua parks , dol@@ phin@@ aria and ocean@@ aria .
it is notable that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months , because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air war@@ ms to 23 degrees .
the Dead Sea is even warmer , and people swim in it all year round .
incidentally , it is the most unusual sea in the world , located in the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below sea level .
its az@@ ure water is sal@@ ine and easily keeps you af@@ lo@@ at , even if you don &apos;t know how to swim .
the surrounding landscapes are surreal in their beauty .
people come here to undergo a course of treatment using salt water - wra@@ ps and medicinal mu@@ ds , and to improve their health if they have dermatitis , allergies , as@@ th@@ mas , ec@@ zem@@ as , arthritis , bron@@ ch@@ itis , or diabetes , or to return emotional balance .
touch the mysteries of antiquity
they are preserved in the old section of Tel @-@ Aviv - in the town of J@@ aff@@ a on the Mediterranean Sea .
the famous sea route connecting Egypt , Syria , Anatolia , and Mesopotam@@ ia runs through it .
the city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends .
according to legends , this is where Noah built his ark and Per@@ seus saved the beauty Andro@@ m@@ eda , with whom he lived a long and happy life .
tourists really like to wander the narrow streets named after signs of the zo@@ di@@ ac .
they say , if you touch the walls on the street of your sign , fortune will come to you .
in J@@ aff@@ a , you can meet new@@ ly@@ w@@ eds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for photo sessions .
and in Caes@@ area - the city of King Her@@ od - you can walk around a Roman theatre , &quot; capture &quot; the Crus@@ ader fortress .
during the Roman period , Caes@@ area was the main city of Ju@@ dea and the residence of Roman pref@@ ects , including Ponti@@ us Pil@@ ate .
the carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances .
a note for the tourist
when you go to Israel , don &apos;t worry about your bad English knowledge : approximately 30 % of the country &apos;s population speaks Russian .
for the trip , it is better to take dollars , not euros , because they are easily exchanged for sh@@ ek@@ els ( currently 1 dollar = 3.8 sh@@ ek@@ els ) .
city transportation is mainly buses , but Jerusalem has a high @-@ speed tram , and Hai@@ fa has the only subway line in the country , comprising six stops and connecting upper town with lower .
in essence , it is an underground cable railway .
a ticket for any type of city transportation costs 6 sh@@ ek@@ els , and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers .
according to the Jewish tradition , Sab@@ bath is celebrated in Israel .
between Friday evening and the sunset on Saturday , markets , stores , and public transportation stop working .
the work week starts on Sunday morning .
many cafes , restaurants and hotels have only ko@@ sher food , with no pork , seafood , fish with no scales , or dishes that combine milk with meat .
there is a wide selection of dishes from lamb and beef , sou@@ ps and desserts cooked using coconut milk , traditional Jewish hum@@ mus paste , various sau@@ ces , fal@@ afel ( balls made of ground chick@@ pe@@ as ) , fruits and vegetables .
the streets of Israel don &apos;t have homeless dogs .
but there are many well @-@ fed cats , which walk around la@@ z@@ ily .
in the evening , they can even be seen sleeping on roofs of parked cars .
these p@@ uss@@ y@@ cats like busy places and do not refuse treats .
car rental , depending on car type , costs from 37 ( Hy@@ un@@ dai G@@ etz ) to 188 ( Audi A6 , Volvo S@@ 80 ) dollars a day .
plus insurance of 15 dollars a day .
bike rental costs 15 sh@@ ek@@ els a day .
Museum entrance costs 30 sh@@ ek@@ els on average .
in numbers
in 2012 , over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel .
visitors and holidaymakers arrive mostly from the USA , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , England , and Ukraine .
between January and October 2012 1@@ 18,@@ 800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Holy Land , which is 51 % more than a similar figure in 2010 , before the removal of the visa regime on February 9 , 2011 .
only the &quot; high and mighty &quot; make it to Moscow : migrants save money for language
while dep@@ uties and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing , the country already has sc@@ am artists who sell fake certificates .
every year , 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow , St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia .
mostly these are citizens of Central Asia : Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
their only goal is to earn money to support families back home .
a new law came into effect on December 1 , which obliges every migrant worker to pass a Russian language test .
for the moment , this law applies only to those who intend to work in services , housing and utility services , household services , and retail .
but with time - as promised by the Federal Migration Service - tests will become mandatory for all non @-@ residents .
in addition to language , Russian history and basics of the legal system will be tested .
language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work permit .
an exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language .
people who received education certificates and diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also exempt under the law .
purpose , doomed fate , and the protection of rights
seven testing points will be operating under the auspices of the P@@ ush@@ kin Institute of Russian Language , Peoples &apos; Friendship University of Russia , Moscow State University ( M@@ G@@ U ) , St. Petersburg State University ( SP@@ b@@ G@@ U ) , and other Russian education institutions .
migrants can take the tests in all cities ; more than 160 such centres have been opened .
the initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State Duma members and the Federal Migration Services .
but human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ?
what will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the non @-@ residents ?
first of all , according to representatives of the migration service , this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery .
many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants , explains the Head of the representative office of the Federal Migration Services of Russia , Viktor Seb@@ elev .
rights protection should begin before their departure .
only the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers .
migrants without profession , education , who do not know Russian , who do not have a medical certificate start to have problems .
if a migrant does not understand the language , says Seb@@ elev with certainty , he is doomed to come across un@@ conscientious people , who , pretending to help , will force upon him a &quot; ticket &quot; to terrible , cramped bar@@ racks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents , sla@@ ving away 12 @-@ 14 hours a day .
we receive many complaints from our migrants .
&quot; they are promised one thing at home , but when they arrive , they are lied to , their passports are taken , they are not paid what they were promised , &quot; confirms the Head of the Main Mig@@ rant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Tajikistan To@@ lib Sh@@ ari@@ po@@ v .
not be angry , boss !
nonetheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
naturally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few Turks , Uz@@ be@@ ks , and Ta@@ ji@@ ks can afford even a basic education .
their families don &apos;t even have food to feed their children , not to mention decent clothing , shoes , and supplies .
after reaching adolesc@@ ence , these kids go to work at the first opportunity .
it is hard , if language knowledge is bad , they admit .
&quot; you feel humiliated and inferior . &quot;
but human rights activists note one important point about the law on language .
testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status .
if they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work in the future .
in the meantime , most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally .
&quot; welcome , or No Un@@ authorized Entry &quot;
many of the foreigners assert that receiving official status in our country is not that easy .
the reason lies in bureaucratic hurdles and the already mentioned language difficulties .
in addition , leg@@ alization costs money : from 12,000 to 16@@ ,000 rub@@ les .
whereas a fake registration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand .
officers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fake papers , without registration , hence the extor@@ tion .
&quot; they ask for a hundred or two for cigarettes , tea , &quot; Um@@ ed Kh@@ ush@@ k@@ adam@@ ov , a citizen of Tajikistan , shared with journalists .
&quot; roll up , don &apos;t be cheap , get your artwork &quot;
on the first day of the law &apos;s entry into effect it turned out that not only migrant registration documents can be fake .
a few forged certificates about passing language tests have been seized by Federal Migration Services officers already .
forged documents are printed on a standard colour printer .
naturally , they were not free for their owners : each of the migrants , who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rub@@ les for them .
it is two and a half times more than the process of official testing , which costs three thousand .
government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certificates could not just be bought .
for the moment , the authorities can promise migrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course .
in addition , those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people .
the Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation
the share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
the Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tough@@ en up the law for owners of civil weapons .
this is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents : click shots at weddings , where there were no casualties , and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmit@@ ry Vin@@ ogra@@ do@@ v , resulting in CL@@ ICK the death of seven people .
policemen want to prohibit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21 .
the idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Safety and Anti @-@ Cor@@ ruption , Irina Y@@ ar@@ ov@@ aya , who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future .
not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by &quot; tightening the screws . &quot;
an open letter appeared online , whose authors - representatives of different social rifle organizations - demand to abandon the &quot; senseless tough@@ ening . &quot;
the percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal , said criminal lawyer Vasi@@ ly Les@@ ni@@ kov to BBC Russia .
according to the Ministry of the Interior &apos;s statistics , 142 crimes using firearms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012 , whereas 1,@@ 16@@ 8,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period .
authors of the open letter are certain that the tough@@ ening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the &quot; black &quot; market .
according to them , one can find any weapon at a low price right now .
nonetheless , the Ministry of the Interior asserts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control .
suppliers : from plants to officers
the &quot; black &quot; market of weapons is replen@@ ished through several channels .
there are five such channels , explains retired colon@@ el Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets , who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for 10 years .
screenshot of the site that accepts orders for weapons .
first : &quot; army or military loot , &quot; i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus .
&quot; weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Cauc@@ asi@@ ans , &quot; says Bar@@ an@@ ets .
next are &quot; black weapons , &quot; stolen by criminals from representatives of defence agencies .
Bar@@ an@@ ets explains that this covers weapons taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies &apos; employees .
illegal arms are taken to be sold from military warehouses .
explosions have often been heard at military warehouses .
&quot; there are proven theories that some of the fires were intentional , in order to cover the shortage , &quot; says the former military man .
manufacturers of weapons make their contribution , according to Bar@@ an@@ ets .
&quot; there are so many private weapons factories now , which do not endure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market , including in Moscow , &quot; says the expert .
another source of the &quot; black &quot; market is trafficking .
an especially high number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan .
&quot; there &apos;s production there , sometimes handmade ; and a mafia has formed , which has organized a stream , &quot; explains the former military man .
where do the weapons come from ?
experts counted the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the &quot; black &quot; market .
a report about this was prepared by the Centre of Problems Analysis and Public Management Planning in 2011 .
experts analysed the reports of the Department of the Interior and Ros@@ stat , crimin@@ ology literature and open data from portals on weapons .
the overwhelming majority of illegal weapons , according to the researchers , comes from the military and security forces .
half of all arms on the black market are there &quot; because of officials , whose work is connected with weapons , &quot; states the report .
according to researchers &apos; data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas , 14 % is theft during production , 5 % is &quot; black archaeology . &quot;
a sales consultant of one of the weapons stores , who wished to remain anonymous , asserts that the weapons found by &quot; black &quot; dig@@ gers are not being bought any more , because they &apos;re too old .
according to him , dealers go to the military warehouse for a new batch of goods .
one piece , for example a TT gun can be bought from a warrant officer .
it is issued to him , and given through the fence .
&quot; he takes it to the city and sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines , &quot; he says .
&quot; the truth is that police are aware of everything , that is why periodically , when the crime detection rate is low , it conducts test purchases from illegal weapons merchants , &quot; says the consultant .
&quot; like in a luxury store &quot;
the buyer and seller often find each other through friends .
I looked at sites , blogs , till someone responded , offering me to go to Beg@@ ov@@ aya station , where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the &quot; corner &quot; so we can negotiate .
I found out the price of the weapon only there
military comment@@ ator Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets
to get a weapon , I need someone with connections , says the sales consultant . - I have an acquaintance , but I &apos;m not sure it &apos;s reliable .
there are sales@@ men on labour markets , but one needs to &quot; come &quot; there conditionally &quot; from John Do@@ e , who asked to tell that his daughter lost a tooth . &quot;
right now , even if I need a few k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le@@ du@@ sters , I get them through someone I trust .
he also supplies them only to me , because he knows that I won &apos;t give him away .
beginners look for weapons in different ways .
former military man Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid @-@ 1990 &apos;s , when he was preparing to publish an article about this .
the formulas are still the same , according to him .
he was given an album of pictures with &quot; anything and everything . &quot;
&quot; I felt like I was in a luxury store , &quot; he recalls .
according to Bar@@ an@@ ets , the buyer is not offered a pig in a poke - you can try out everything .
I , the potential client , am not just buying ; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there .
&quot; I am given the opportunity to shoot , and when I am certain that the weapon is good , we begin to negotiate , &quot; describes the expert .
store on a sofa
Internet searches lead to sites and &quot; V@@ kontakte &quot; groups , where weapons &quot; for different purposes &quot; are on offer .
no documents or personal meetings are needed .
&quot; it &apos;s enough to have a certain sum of money , &quot; says the advertisement heading on the website &quot; Buy a pist@@ ol or rifle . &quot;
users leave their requests and ask questions .
can a minor buy ?
&quot; without a license , of course , &quot; asks user &quot; John &quot; ( name is changed ) .
&quot; want to buy a TT , Moscow , &quot; conc@@ is@@ ely requests &quot; Fed@@ oren@@ kov . &quot;
Federal Security Service now spread a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons .
people come like hungry fish to ba@@ it , and then mine coal in Siberia .
military comment@@ ator and former military man Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets
I heard about this : normally the site is registered outside the area of applicability of the laws of Russia .
people accept orders .
the buyer pays at an ATM .
&quot; in response , a photo is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden , &quot; says Press Secretary of the Rights to Weapons non @-@ governmental organization Dmit@@ ry Kis@@ lov .
Viktor Bar@@ an@@ ets confirms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weapon and go to jail .
the Federal Security Service now spreads a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons .
&quot; people are like hungry fish after ba@@ it , and end in Siberia mining coal , &quot; - he says .
Mak@@ ar@@ ov for 100 dollars
when buying illegal firearms , 100 to 900 dollars is enough according to experts .
according to Dmit@@ ry Kis@@ lov from the Rights to Weapons organization , a Mak@@ ar@@ ov gun can be acquired for 100 @-@ 300 dollars .
the wait time is a month to a month and a half .
it is shipped from long @-@ term storage warehouses by the mid @-@ level management of these warehouses .
according to official statistics of the authorities , the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dropped 7 % as compared to January @-@ October 2011 , amounting to 22,@@ 900 , while the number of cases of theft and extor@@ tion of weapons , ammunition , explosive substances and explosive devices dropped by 7.@@ 8 % .
fast @-@ food and supermarket workers are on strike in the U.S.A.
up to a fourth of all American teenagers have worked the cash register at McDonald &apos;s at one time or another
in the last few days , there is a wave of protest actions in the U.S.A. against low salaries in supermarkets of the Wal@@ mar@@ t chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like McDonald &apos;s , Burger King , T@@ aco Bell , Wend@@ y &apos;s and Kentucky Fri@@ ed Ch@@ icken .
right now , nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is destined to fiz@@ z@@ le out early .
actions are being supported by unions and a series of left @-@ wing organizations .
in addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Wal@@ mar@@ t and fast food chains , the goal of the protesters is to create unions within them .
this sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet .
46 cents a year ?
actions began last week after Than@@ ks@@ giving , on Black Friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by clashes .
on this day , some employees of the Wal@@ mar@@ t corporation , which employs 2.2 million people around the world , left their workplaces and pick@@ eted together with the unions and left @-@ wing activists from the corporation stores that sell products to people on low @-@ to @-@ medium incomes .
Wal@@ mar@@ t sells everything imaginable , from di@@ apers , hunting ri@@ fl@@ es and car batteries , to vacuum cleaners , eggs and milk .
products in its stores are on average 8 % to 27 % cheaper than in major supermarkets .
so many low @-@ paid Wal@@ mar@@ t employees shop only at their workplace .
availability and assortment made Wal@@ mar@@ t one of the biggest American corporations .
according to critics , Wal@@ mar@@ t can afford to sell the products cheaply partly because it pays little to its employees .
these latter also complain about hard work conditions , for example lack of lift trucks and hand @-@ held scanners .
protesters on Black Friday demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
a typical Wal@@ mar@@ t employee , receiving 9.5 dollars / hour , cannot afford this .
scientists from the Berkeley University in California argue that if Wal@@ mar@@ t raises the average salary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the corporation 3.2 billion dollars .
this is about 1.1 % more than it spends on salaries right now .
if Wal@@ mar@@ t fully shifts the cost of increasing wages to the shoulders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more .
in one year , they will only spend 12.@@ 39 dollars more than now .
Wal@@ mar@@ t supporters happily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corporation .
black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday till midnight the next day , and during the period Wal@@ mar@@ t sold about 5000 products a second .
in total , its cash registers conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday .
representative of the corporation , Dan Fo@@ gel@@ man , asserted in an interview with a left @-@ wing site , the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , that a total of &quot; less than five &quot; Wal@@ mar@@ t employees left the workplace , and the protest act was just &quot; another PR trick &quot; of the union that organized it .
&quot; free cash register ! &quot;
protests continued this week in New York , where their object was not Wal@@ mar@@ t ( they &apos;re not so welcome in the progressive city , that is why they don &apos;t exist here yet ) , but McDonald &apos;s and other cheap restaurants .
McDonald &apos;s says that it sells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn &apos;t even give you sick days or pay you for honest work !
Ju@@ ma@@ ane Williams , member of the City Council of New York
at the moment , the minimum salary according to federal and NY law is 7.@@ 25 dollars an hour .
fast food restaurants increase it with time , but very little . on average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.@@ 90 dollars / hour .
nobody earns less in this expensive city .
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money .
once upon a time , almost a fourth of American teenagers went through McDonald &apos;s , working part @-@ time after school , living with parents .
few saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long .
now I continuously come across interviews with McDonald &apos;s employees , who complain that they have to survive on this salary and sometimes even feed their children .
on the other hand , there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum , whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them .
participants of the protest that began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday near the McDonald &apos;s on 40th street and Madison Avenue demanded that cas@@ hier@@ s and cooks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i.e. more than double their present wages .
they also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry .
American law prohibits the administration from preventing this or punishing activists of the union movement by nag@@ ging or firing .
on the other hand , the administration does not often ease their life .
but for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union .
one of them is the unusual turnover of employees .
dis@@ agreeing
noisy protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan .
the highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near McDonald &apos;s by Times Square , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . one of them , Ju@@ ma@@ ane Williams , said : &quot; McDonald &apos;s claims it sells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn &apos;t even give you sick days or pay you for honest work ! &quot;
demonstrators were supported by other prominent NY democrats , like Bill de Bla@@ sio , a candidate for NY city mayor , who said : &quot; we need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can achieve fair wages and economic wellbeing , which every New Yorker deserves ! . &quot;
according to the New York Times , this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry .
but only a few hundred people took part in it , and many of them were not fast food employees , which comprise tens of thousands of people in New York .
it is unclear right now whether this will spark a mass movement .
&quot; at the moment , the mind cannot be deceived too well &quot;
among modern technology fans a popular topic is augmented reality , lately seen primarily through the pris@@ m of special glasses .
at first , a functional model was shown by Google in the summer , at its annual conference . then , in November , it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for patent too .
however , according to the conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft , Sha@@ h@@ ram Iz@@ adi , glasses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company .
they are drawn by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands , creating virtual open spaces .
- Please tell us , in simple terms , about the work your research group does .
- We work on the interaction of people with machines , at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction .
while people in general are stuck at working with pixels on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fingers at them .
we want to look 5 @-@ 10 years into the future and predict cardinal changes in this interaction .
for example , Xbox and Kin@@ ect sensors are a step forward . almost no Xbox is sold without Kin@@ ect today , because everyone likes control by gestures .
- What else awaits us in the future ?
- Desp@@ ite the fact that Kin@@ ect shifted the interaction to the physical level , much still occurs on a flat screen , sometimes in 3D .
information entry has improved ( the system receives more data ) , but output still needs to get better .
we are trying to change this , working on truly three @-@ dimensional display systems based on various technologies , including projection technologies .
we need to let the computer world into our physical world , make it more tangible .
but for this , we need to identify both the user and the space around him .
then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form .
above all , get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets !
- What do you think about voice control ?
it &apos;s a popular thing , but is it over@@ estimated ?
- It clearly cannot be called a cure @-@ for @-@ all - there &apos;s a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions .
in reality , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in their own niche .
for example , we had a project to control devices in public places , in which we thought about movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved ones .
movements were not recorded by a camera , but by a hand bracel@@ et that determined the movement of bones and muscles .
it &apos;s big right now , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch .
in general , the future lies in the mixed control , e.g. movement + voice .
- What do you mean ?
- For example , how would you ask me to give you this bottle of water ?
you will talk and show at the same time .
- U@@ su@@ ally I just say .
- Oh , that will be very hard to detect .
- So you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment ?
- Not necessarily , but it is a mutual approximation .
I think in the near future , we will mainly work on developing new sensors that will enable more precise determination of a person &apos;s reaction .
this could be , e.g. laser sensors . they have a decent depth resolution , which is very important .
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kin@@ ect sensors , what are your complaints about modern cameras ?
not enough resolution , depth or something else ?
- In general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on three @-@ dimensional recognition .
of course , it would be good to have eight mega pixels with 1000 k / s speed .
it &apos;s not just the mega pixels , though , but the quality of the matrix and the depth .
from the latter point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers .
so it &apos;s important to remember about the resolution on the X , Y , but also the Z axis .
speed , the number of images per second , is also very important .
human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / s is really not enough , especially for gestures .
Steven Bath@@ iche from our Red@@ mond laboratory created a touch sensor with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern serial sensors are closer to the latter indicator ( 60 @-@ 100 ) .
not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine .
in my work , it would be very useful to have a device that does not require touching and would have more images per second .
- Does the number of cameras need to be increased ?
- In Kin@@ ect there are three cameras now , one of which is actually an infrared em@@ itter and the second one , the recipient of the signal .
the third one is actually a regular sensor of visible range .
it is not applied to determine the object &apos;s depth .
potentially , a large number of cameras could solve the problem ...
or make it worse , by increasing the required volume of calculations .
it would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kin@@ ect , play with the flex@@ ion of camera disposition and see how this will help in three @-@ dimensional determination of the position .
- As far as I remember , Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public , unlike Google .
don &apos;t you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of augmented reality technologies ?
- Cer@@ tain@@ ly it is not very convenient to walk around with a smart phone in your raised hands all the time , but I think that the cool@@ est option would be &quot; transitional &quot; augmented reality , where you could shift from glasses to smart phone , projection display , and everywhere else based on a cloud platform .
glasses are a very personal device , that is their strength ( private things are seen only by you ) and , at the same time , their weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people .
- Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual holograph@@ ic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Star@@ k from Iron@@ man , but to a regular person .
there is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out : no tac@@ tile feedback !
hands feel nothing !
what answers does your group prepare to this challenge ?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive attempt at the interaction between man and machine .
I think that the eighth will probably be the addition of tac@@ tile sensations .
for now , one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a sort of matrix for the image .
it is great at registering pushes !
but there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these &quot; images in the air &quot; a sense of tan@@ gi@@ bility , for example , the interference of several targeted ultrasound rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation , but very weak right now , as if someone ble@@ w on your finger@@ tip .
there are also wr@@ ist bracel@@ ets that affect the nerve end@@ ings in fingers , which is also a promising area .
- Have you tried to deceive the mind ?
to force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something ?
- This is a good idea and we haven &apos;t tried this yet .
it conceals one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person , who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open , almost limitless space ; we are working on the concept of tre@@ ad@@ mills ( not at all like in clubs ) , moving platforms , and giant ballo@@ ons .
so far decei@@ ving the mind has had limited success , there &apos;s work for many years to come .
that &apos;s what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very beginnings .
judgement calls instead of culture - Ros@@ bal@@ t.@@ ru
Ros@@ b@@ alt continues the project St. Petersburg Av@@ ant @-@ garde , dedicated to residents who are ahead , in the avant @-@ garde of culture and art .
this top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg , whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city , often recognized in Europe , byp@@ assing fame in Russia .
the new player in Ros@@ b@@ alt - the bold artist Ki@@ rill Miller .
the whole city knows Ki@@ rill Miller , a bear@@ ded man dressed all in red , who can be seen by the Russian Museum , or by the Summer Garden , or at fashionable parties and shows .
Ki@@ rill Miller &apos;s work always brings in crowds of people , no matter where they are exhibited .
Ki@@ rill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical stor@@ yt@@ ellers and creators of new mythology .
Ki@@ rill Miller is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg avant @-@ garde of the late 80 &apos;s early 90 &apos;s .
moreover , he is a city man , who makes people smile on the street and lifts up everyone &apos;s spirit .
recently he took up the street organ and became St. Petersburg &apos;s music man , because he was ready for this complex role with all his Bohemian existence , philosophy and image .
- Ki@@ rill , why do you walk around the city all in red , not yellow or turquoise , for example ?
- I chose the colour red as a fashion designer engaged in look and image .
in this world , red is a compromise between artist , image @-@ maker and society .
although in society , everything that is not grey causes aggression and ag@@ itation of the bad kind .
but my provoc@@ ations are aimed at starting conversation .
the whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion .
- When did you realise that you must be an artist ?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky House of Culture , where my work was displayed .
it became clear to me that this is my path .
then , the wave of older free , unofficial artists was gone , while new , free artists like me were not understood .
I became friends with the artists of the new wave , with post @-@ Gaza @-@ Nevsky style artists ( &quot; post @-@ gaz@@ on@@ ev@@ sch@@ ina &quot; ) , which led to P@@ ush@@ k@@ ins@@ kaya @-@ 10 , and the wave was no longer .
I &apos;m drawn to theatre , clothing , music , all genres except for literature .
- And all this has been united in your Art @-@ clinic ... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg , where all the best creative forces should come together .
in 1995 , I occupied the territory on P@@ ush@@ k@@ ins@@ kaya @-@ 10 , and while the renovation work had not started , there was a musical and creative club , a Bohemian club , the house of the St. Petersburg Bohemia .
many were born there : nom@@ y , T@@ equ@@ ila Jazz , I remember when Sh@@ nur was brought there with the Van Gogh &apos;s E@@ ar project .
Sh@@ nur and his friends lip sang easy songs , wearing tight le@@ ot@@ ards , and the now trendy composer Igor V@@ do@@ vin was with them .
when the group began to play live , it became Len@@ ingrad .
Trak@@ h@@ ten@@ berg was the presenter of many programs before hal@@ i @-@ Gal@@ i times .
we gave them Trak@@ h@@ ten@@ berg , and a great career was on its way , but the basic education and ment@@ oring he received from us .
gallery D 137 , Gri@@ boy@@ ed@@ ov club - all these echo the Art @-@ clinic .
that is where our staff and regular customers left for .
I am a hero of the last century , when culture meant something .
in 2000 , there was a poll in the press , for the People of Our City prize .
I was nominated Artist of the Year , my climax came to an end .
in the new times , it is uncomfortable to work by old rules . I &apos;m a man of truth , honesty and culture of the last century .
in our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are different . you can be popular , but not very cultural .
- Your work is marked by a recognizable style .
- Many of my works are hits , with clearly reflected relevance and acu@@ ity .
I will have a programme exhibit , &quot; Russian museum in c@@ low@@ ns . &quot;
c@@ low@@ ns are a timeless category .
I was social before , now it is painful and scary to be like that .
but everything is blurred in c@@ low@@ ns , tragedy is removed .
I like grotesque , I have grotesque ideas .
for example , saving the world by totalitarian changing of clothes by order .
nowadays , people are judged by appearance , not their inner qualities .
who knows , maybe you cannot shake his hand , and need to sp@@ it in his face .
and the lie will go away with the help of changing clothes .
- Rec@@ ently we saw you in the role of music man . - A cultural city should have such a character .
who fits the role better than I ?
- May@@ be commercial art can also be beautiful ?
- Now@@ adays , commercial art should be neat , consider@@ ate , sweet .
there is a disintegration of cultures .
people used to get together in flo@@ cks , Boh@@ em@@ ians liked one thing , the simple people , something else .
now , everybody is divided into micro societies , it &apos;s hard to be liked by everyone .
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all .
now you have to think who you will please .
now , each cult hero has 100 fans .
- But several thousand come to St@@ as Mik@@ ha@@ il@@ ov !
- The cast @-@ outs go to see him , the sexual @-@ social sphere is at work there .
but 300 people will come for culture , not 10,000 . in the end , there &apos;s less management , money , everything dies out .
I have fans ; the main thing is not to betra@@ y them , not to spoil what I have earned .
in my youth , I painted such art that one collector had it hanging on the same wall with Falk and Lari@@ on@@ ov .
I started with paintings , which people usually end with .
concepts are often mixed up these days .
people say : spiritual culture , consumer culture .
there is no culture in consu@@ mer@@ ism , it &apos;s &quot; from another opera . &quot;
I am a man of yesterday &apos;s culture . I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty , refused money for the sake of painting .
this is the culture I &apos;m for .
- Ki@@ rill , what is St. Petersburg missing ?
- Good cultural experts .
there is such a thing : an official for culture .
but not everyone can be engaged in culture .
under the right rulers everything was different . kings may not have understood culture very well , but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts .
there are good consultants in Moscow right now .
here in St. Petersburg , there are people who could be experts , but they are pushed to the side , because more advanced experts are needed , who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them .
judgement calls are what thrive now .
even Er@@ art , but they &apos;re different because they say honestly that we don &apos;t accept all modern art . there are some artists , who need to find other museums for themselves .
- What does St. Petersburg mean to you ?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital , Moscow has much more culture , there is bedro@@ ck there .
it &apos;s hard for art to grow on our rocks .
we need cultural bedro@@ ck , but we now have more writers than readers . this is wrong .
in Europe , there are many curious people , who go to art exhibits , concerts .
here , this layer is thin .
we need to make art fashionable , as it was in the beginning of last century .
the project is supported by the St. Petersburg grant .
give birth in space
the earth is in danger .
global warming or an encounter with a killer asteroid .
caravans of cosmic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet .
to save humanity , the question is how to propag@@ ate our race in conditions of weigh@@ t@@ lessness or on that replacement planet ?
I think the choice is small .
there are only two actual planets that can be explored even hypothe@@ tically .
&quot; Venus and Mars , &quot; says Senior Res@@ ear@@ cher of the P.@@ K. Sh@@ tern@@ berg State Astronom@@ y Institute ( GA@@ IS@@ h ) Vladimir Sur@@ din .
but while conditions on Mars are more appropriate for life , Venus has 500 @-@ degree temperatures .
life is possible only at a high altitude or on the orbit of Venus ... in space .
the question of reproduction in space began with flora .
half a century ago , experiments were run on plants .
four generations of pe@@ as grown in orbit were no different from their earth counterparts .
then , insects were bred in orbit , small fruit flies .
in 1979 , qu@@ ail eggs were sent to space , to check how an embryo develops in weigh@@ t@@ lessness .
we get an absolutely normal ch@@ ick .
but then the problem begins .
&quot; the problem is related to the fact that this ch@@ ick needs to find support , needs to get on its feet and start moving , &quot; explains head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems ( IM@@ BP ) RA@@ N Vladimir Sy@@ chev .
having found no support , ch@@ icks were tum@@ bling around in disorder .
after 10 hours , the new@@ bor@@ ns experienced complete atro@@ phy of instincts .
ch@@ icks did not react to light and sound .
and the problem was that they simply died after four days .
&quot; we bred ch@@ icks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there , &quot; says Vladimir Sy@@ chev , confirming the failure of the experiment with ch@@ icks in space .
the last biological &quot; mini @-@ ark &quot; with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago .
in spring 2013 , experiments will continue .
however , only same @-@ sex beings will be on the B@@ ion bio @-@ satellite .
there was an experiment with rats , who were sent to space with fo@@ etus .
in principle , there was nothing extraordinary there .
&quot; this was on bio @-@ satellites , but again , it was a singular experiment and such research needs to be conducted , &quot; says Vladimir Sy@@ chev .
after landing , the cosmic rats had babies .
but it &apos;s hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space .
it &apos;s not an easy task .
animals simply cannot follow their sexual instinct , when they &apos;re out of their familiar environment .
in principle , people , unlike animals , can .
Homo sap@@ iens have abstract thinking , and are able to create a fitting emotional background .
such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons .
but women have been flying to space for 50 years .
the biggest risk was for Ter@@ esh@@ kova .
the most valuable thing for humanity is the female body .
our &quot; Se@@ ag@@ ull &quot; left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be OK after flying to space .
whether she will be able to give birth after this flight .
&quot; nobody answered this question , &quot; says rocket and space industry veteran , Vak@@ ht@@ ang V@@ ach@@ nad@@ ze .
in June 1964 , only a year after flying to space , the first woman in space Valent@@ ina Ter@@ esh@@ kova gave birth to a daughter .
the child &apos;s father , Andri@@ an Nikol@@ a@@ ev , was also a cos@@ mon@@ aut .
in 1988 , the second woman cos@@ mon@@ aut , Sv@@ et@@ lana Sav@@ it@@ skaya , who went into orbit twice and even worked in open space , gave birth to a son .
however , the risk remains .
we have few , very few cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts , who were OK and had healthy children after long flights .
&quot; what &apos;s more , it is dangerous even for orbit@@ al flights , &quot; adds pilot and cos@@ mon@@ aut , Hero of the USSR , Hero of Russia , Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov .
and yet , humanity needs to seek out some new avenues in biotechn@@ ologies , protection from radiation , creation of artificial gravity .
hydro @-@ laboratory of CP@@ K - mandatory phase of training for a flight .
here , cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts practice skills of working in open space in zero @-@ gravity conditions .
water im@@ itates weigh@@ t@@ lessness .
if for adults water is a foreign medium , although comfortable , for infants it is a native element .
small amphi@@ bians seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean .
there is a connection with the fact that an infant spends about 9 months in am@@ ni@@ otic fluid in the wom@@ b ; it is easier to get used to water after that .
in principle , it is logical , because only two weeks pass from birth until the first bathing .
&quot; this is very little time to forget something , &quot; says infant swimming instructor Marina Ak@@ sen@@ ova .
in other words , if for a new@@ born weigh@@ t@@ lessness is more natural , a woman needs gravity , earth &apos;s pull .
stomach and pel@@ vic muscles usually quickly de@@ generate in weigh@@ t@@ lessness ; the ability to push out the embryo is reduced .
well , let &apos;s assume that childbirth stimul@@ ators will work out .
maybe she will push out the baby in a special room .
&quot; then what ? &quot; - asks Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov about this non @-@ trivial issue .
on the other hand , a baby also needs artificial gravity .
when a body does not feel the earth &apos;s pull , it does not form the skeletal and muscular system .
it is not possible to dress a new@@ born in orbit into a special loading suit for training , as they do with adults .
he will simply not have what he needs to survive .
&quot; and this experiment , that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment , will lead to us bringing a handicapped , completely un@@ adapted human to earth , &quot; predic@@ ts Chairman of the Committee on Bio@@ ethics IM@@ BP RA@@ N Igor Pest@@ ov .
for the moment , birth of children in space is just a theory .
however , with time , it will become reality , when earth@@ lings will go to a far@@ away planet in their ships , and it will become the home for their offspring , who were born in space .
N@@ KU Head : S@@ var@@ c System audit has failed because of politicians .
the Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts , but it lags behind in their application .
this was said by Milos@@ lav Kal@@ a , vice @-@ president of the Supreme Audit Office ( N@@ KU ) in an interview for Aktu@@ al@@ ne@@ .c@@ z.
&quot; the Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion , &quot; states Kal@@ a , commenting on the current situation .
similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German auditors .
as an example of improper practice , they cite Petr Nec@@ as &apos;s approach to the so @-@ called &quot; S@@ var@@ c System . &quot;
the Prime Minister recently claimed that the O@@ DS will not be bur@@ dening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed ?
&quot; the Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something , then even the Government &apos;s head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is duty @-@ bound to monitor and enforce , &quot; asserts Kal@@ a .
at the audit committee &apos;s session in the House of Dep@@ uties , you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared .
what exactly was this about ?
this is about parallel auditing , which we began around two years ago .
simply put , this is about how European legislation governs the handling of public contracts , followed by individual state legislations and then the actual practice itself .
we brought all this together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms , our legislation might be even &quot; more concise and complete , &quot; however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany .
this confirms that creating more and more concise rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws .
what does this project actually help you with , and what do you think its outcome will bring ?
this kind of joint audit could contribute to curtail@@ ing these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a positive impact .
economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that profit@@ eering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided .
however , just because we have reduced the order limits , does not mean something will be proc@@ ured .
the system might become overloaded with the amount of paperwork , and those , who wish to look for loopholes in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher .
these are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts .
how does the audit system work in Germany ?
is there an office like the N@@ KU , or is it organised differently ?
as far as the office is concerned , the Bundes@@ rechn@@ ungsh@@ of functions like our N@@ KU , and it is organised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently , but basically both offices operate similarly .
powers are also similar to a degree , though of course Germany is organised feder@@ ally , so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly differs from our own .
the BR@@ H can only audit federal money , known to us as state funds .
public funds , which , for us , are administered by regional and municipal authorities , are audited by the federal courts of auditors there .
when it comes to their legislation , is it more straightforward than ours ?
overall , I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data , nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect .
is this because , perhaps , they have better enforcement ?
that is certainly not true , but again , I prefer not to make such comparisons .
it should be said that even in a country we perceive as exemplary , they encounter a whole range of problems .
if that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with our office , would they ?
coming back to domestic legislation , what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office , is its impact being felt already ?
the period since the amendment came into force has been quite short , so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet .
since we carry out our audits ex @-@ post , a certain delay has to be taken into account .
as yet , we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new &quot; fiscal failure risk detection &quot; system , with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts , and these have been analysed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on .
so do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit , or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system ?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction , and I hope this will be confirmed .
a problem , which may arise here , is that the law becomes &quot; too constrained &quot; and will not be enforceable .
under the previous rules , parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline .
is it worth constra@@ ining the law in this way , in that case ?
I do not think this is the way .
the system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not penalise those , who make a mistake on a techn@@ icality , which does not affect the final decision .
this kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy .
so how can we get out of this ?
let &apos;s see where this dead @-@ end takes us .
the Prime Minister recently said the O@@ DS will not be bur@@ dening businessmen with audits of the so @-@ called &quot; S@@ var@@ c System &quot; - what does this mean ?
is the S@@ var@@ c System prohibited or allowed ?
the Law must be set out one way or the other , and if it prohibits something , then even the Government &apos;s head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is duty @-@ bound to monitor and enforce .
he may say : &quot; let us change this law and relax it , &quot; but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there .
the law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formalities which must be adhered to - which is the right way to ensure public tenders are protected .
on the other hand , it is a tragedy , when a bi@@ dder with the best offer is excluded on a techn@@ icality .
the Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion .
roads are icy in places , but mostly passable .
in several places in the Czech Republic , the main roads are icy and snowy .
however , the majority of roads are passable , with extra care needed in places .
Car@@ ls@@ bad region
in the Car@@ ls@@ bad region , the roads have been usable this morning , though in some places they were icy and snowy .
the temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day .
snow@@ ing in the region has stopped , and only a thin layer of snow remains in the low@@ lands .
however , the ridges of the Kr@@ us@@ ne Mountains have around 30 cen@@ timet@@ res of snow .
in some locations there is limited visibility due to mist , according to the local highway service .
the R@@ 6 high @-@ speed motorway and primary roads in the region are now usable without restriction .
caution is , of course , appropriate , for example , on certain bridges , where the surface can be icy and slippery .
all secondary and tertiary roads are also passable , including mountain roads .
in certain stretches of these roads there might be remaining frozen and comp@@ acted snow patches .
above all , at higher levels , extra care should be taken while driving .
Par@@ dub@@ ice and Hradec Kr@@ alo@@ ve region
on some roads in Eastern Bohemia , there might be a risk of black ice , at higher altitudes and in the mountains there might be a layer of comp@@ acted snow , according to the Road and Motorway Directorate .
the highway service is warning the drivers against black ice , which might occur at higher altitudes of the Par@@ dub@@ ice region in particular .
black ice may occur around Lan@@ sk@@ rou@@ n , U@@ sti nad Or@@ li@@ ci , Poli@@ cky , S@@ vit@@ av@@ y , and Vy@@ so@@ ke My@@ to , and particularly on secondary and tertiary roads .
the I / 43 and I / 34 roads have been chem@@ ically treated around S@@ vit@@ av@@ y .
snow is particularly affecting the roads in the Krkon@@ ose and Or@@ li@@ cke mountains .
at higher altitudes , there is a comp@@ acted snow layer on the roads around Ry@@ ch@@ nov nad Kne@@ zn@@ ou and Tr@@ ut@@ nov .
in Eastern Bohemia the day will be mostly clear to partly cloudy , and dry .
temperatures will be between minus three and plus one degree Celsius mostly , with a light wind .
Pilsen region
the roads in the Pilsen region have been usable this morning , with extra care needed in some places . drivers should take the weather conditions into account .
the morning will be fro@@ sty , with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero .
due to the existing snow and subsequent drop in temperature , certain roads may be icy .
drivers should expect mist in places , though visibility will gradually improve .
this information was reported by the region &apos;s highway service .
the D@@ 5 motorway is dri@@ vable almost without restriction , but the road services recommend extra caution between the 80@@ th and 13@@ 1st kilometre marks .
most primary road surfaces are dry and frost @-@ free .
southern areas of the Pilsen and Tach@@ ov regions may have icy patches .
secondary and tertiary roads are wet , and may therefore also have icy patches .
drivers should be cautious especially on less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest .
Olomouc region
drivers should expect snow sl@@ ush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Olomouc region .
it is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cer@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ k@@ se sed@@ lo and on the way to Vi@@ del@@ sky Kri@@ z .
snow@@ pl@@ ou@@ ghs were brought out by falling snow overnight , the Sum@@ per@@ k region , according to highway maintenance , got around three cen@@ timet@@ res of snow .
in other parts of the region , roads are mainly passable without restrictions .
&quot; in the Sum@@ per@@ k region , traces of snow have remained at the highest altitudes .
drivers should expect snow sl@@ ush at Cer@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ ske sed@@ lo in the direction of Jesen@@ ik , &quot; the dispatch officer for the Sum@@ per@@ k highway service told CT@@ K today .
their Jesen@@ ik counterparts also made an outing overnight ; the roads all the way to the highest altitudes are now clear and wet following the chemical treatment , according to them .
the Olomouc region &apos;s roads are usable without restriction , while in the area of Stern@@ berk drivers should beware in wooded areas , where roads have remained wet .
U@@ sti nad Lab@@ em region , Liberec region
since this morning , the snow@@ pl@@ ou@@ ghs have reported several places , which are difficult to pass in northern Bohemia .
besides certain snow @-@ covered places , or some icy frost patches , the mountain road from Tel@@ nice to Kn@@ in@@ ice in the U@@ sti nad Lab@@ em region is also closed , according to the police database .
temperatures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snowy and icy . in the low@@ lands , however , particularly southeast of the Central Bohemian U@@ pl@@ ands , there are no problems and roads are mostly dry .
no traffic hold @-@ ups have so far been reported .
icy frost patches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around Ste@@ ti .
according to meteor@@ ologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and melting snow during the day , with a clear night and freezing temperatures .
adverse conditions are expected on the main sections of the I / 13 road between the U@@ sti nad Lab@@ em and Liberec regions .
the closure of the Tel@@ nice to Kn@@ in@@ ice road was caused by bent tree branches , which were weighed down to road level by snow@@ fall .
Simon Or@@ nest : at the concerts we want a fusion of positive energy
what is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month ?
it is just another star@@ tler , which we like to lat@@ ch on to .
together with The Tap Tap band , we tend to joke about it , saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or avert the end of the world completely .
in December you are even organising a unique series of three concerts against the end of the world .
can you give our readers some details on this ?
this is a nationwide fund @-@ raising event , which we have been planning for the past two years .
we decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar , due on the 21st of December at 11 : 10 a.m.
on the eve , the 20th of December , at 9@@ pm , 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Prague , Brno , and Ostrava .
they will end at around the time when Ki@@ rib@@ ati Island in the Pacific , which is 12 hours ahead of us , reaches the end of the Mayan calendar .
who came up with this idea ?
initially it was probably my idea , later we worked all the details out with our designer , Hon@@ za Augusta .
apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , hand it over to our children .
on the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar , we have also prepared a range of unique items , shoes , t @-@ shirts , bags , and original keys against the end of the world , which can be purchased at www.@@ e @-@ tap@@ .cz to support our cause .
the Tap Tap band , together with other artists , also recorded the so @-@ called anthem against the end of the world , called &quot; The End of the World is cancelled . &quot;
it is already well received on YouTube , will it figure at the fund @-@ raising concerts ?
of course , for the grand finale , as long as the world does not end beforehand .
it will be sung by all the artists at all the three concerts at the same time .
the anthem will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television .
the words were written and the role of Jesus in the video clip was played by T@@ omas Han@@ ak , X@@ ind@@ l X also sings in it ...
how did you end up working with them ?
we collaborate also with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene , due to organising a lot of fund @-@ raising events and concerts ...
we try to really get them involved in these projects .
it turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us .
what will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to ?
equipping the wheelchair @-@ accessible educational Stu@@ deo centre , which is already in its sixth year , in collaboration with the citizens association Tap from the Jed@@ lick@@ a Institute for the disabled .
tut@@ ors come in regularly to spend time with the Jed@@ lick@@ a Institute &apos;s students and run activities , which they enjoy and interest them .
the students themselves do not have the funds to afford tut@@ ors , so we try to provide this for them in this way .
within the construction project at the Jed@@ lick@@ a Institute , a separate building is planned , which we can move into with this project .
every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists .
how do you select them ?
we have tried to compile a programme , which speaks for all ages , including children .
for example , in Prague , Chin@@ aski , Support les@@ bi@@ ens , Illustr@@ ato@@ sphere with Dan Bar@@ ta , The Tap Tap , Marian Bang@@ o and Ji@@ ri Such@@ y will appear .
further details can be found at www.@@ k@@ p@@ ks@@ .c@@ z.
are you planning any more &quot; bom@@ bas@@ tic events &quot; in the future ?
in May , we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring , so we will definitely be preparing a good line @-@ up with some interesting guests .
next year , we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York , and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appearances in Washington and Chicago .
your international plans are not modest ; you have already performed , for instance , in Madrid , Brussels , London , and Moscow .
the Tap Tap is nonetheless a band composed of handicapped people .
how do you cope with these journeys in terms of logistics and organisation ?
it is not as scary as it might seem at first .
we have five members in electric wheelchairs , which must be transported in the luggage area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of luggage and instrument cases ...
nevertheless , we have so far managed it without any problems , CSA and British Airways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , I was quite surprised .
even in Moscow , which we have just returned from , it all went smoothly .
thanks to these international trips , you will have had a chance to compare specific accessibility issues , public attitudes to disability and so on .
what have been your experiences so far ?
after Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other places , where everything functions better than here , we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beginnings .
compared to Prague , Moscow is rather inaccessible ; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric wheelchair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own .
obvious things , such as giving wheelchairs priority in lifts , are not commonplace there .
fortunately , citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities .
and on the other hand , where do we still lag behind more advanced countries ?
there are a lot of things , which we still lag behind on ...
it is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected .
in London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious handicaps to be independently out in public , and they can use the toilets , go to the museum , or wherever ...
it is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life , in this respect with The Tap Tap we are a step ahead !
public respect or accessibility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous athletes , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change .
so far there are only exceptional cases , people who are strong @-@ will@@ ed .
the Tap Tap band is currently very popular , but let us look back a few years , what prompted you in 1998 to form it ?
I began my job as a tutor at the Jed@@ lick@@ a Institute , where I was surrounded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something .
since I am a musician myself - among others I play the sax@@ ophone - I started a music club with a colleague .
with time , as our moderator Lad@@ ya Angel@@ ovic says , it has grown a little out of our control ( laugh ) .
your popularity has only come about in the last few years , or am I mistaken ?
it is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous singers and also by our proactive work on promoting the band .
we realised that work , which goes on un@@ seen can be like it never existed .
thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tut@@ ors , equipment and so on .
was it your goal to take The Tap Tap to such heights ?
from the outset , I felt there was potential to do things a little differently .
show business is filled with things , where one im@@ itates the other .
it is logical in its own way ; all new things are taken in hesit@@ antly and take a long time .
things , which are unique , are few and far between , but I would dare to claim that Tap Tap is one of those things .
a person &apos;s first impression on seeing you is , of course , pity - it is a natural reaction ...
but that pity is simply wasted , because handicapped people are not abandoned and suffering beings , who need to be piti@@ ed .
they are people , who can fully live life and blossom , assuming , of course , that they have the right environment for it .
I say that when a person with a handicap succeeds in something , it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole .
has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader , as many people are suggesting ?
if we want to achieve top class work , we must be uncompromising in many things and require a certain level of discipline .
I think this is to be expected .
some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clouds , and when they find out they have to go to rehear@@ sals twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts , their enthusiasm quickly disappears .
that is how it works everywhere , with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something .
the Tap Tap band currently has twenty members .
how many of those were present at the beginning in 1998 ?
only one , Lad@@ ya Angel@@ ovic .
we are an open group , people come and people go , this is unavoidable .
those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open .
the event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected , on Thursday 20.@@ 12.@@ 2012 from 9@@ pm .
the venues will be Praha IN@@ CH@@ EBA , Brno Fle@@ da , and Ostrava Ply@@ no@@ jem with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic .
all three cities will be joined by a telev@@ ised link @-@ up at the evening &apos;s close for a united rendition of The Tap Tap &apos;s anthem &quot; The End of the World is cancelled &quot;
the concert &apos;s goal is to raise funds to equip the STU@@ DE@@ O multi @-@ functional wheel @-@ chair accessible learning centre at the Jed@@ lick@@ a Institute in Prague in the sum of 25 million Czech crowns .
admission fee to the concert is 400 CZK , children under 12 years of age go free , tickets on sale from Boh@@ emi@@ ati@@ cket .
Poland and the Cosmo@@ s .
last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency admitted Poland as the twentieth member of the agency , being the second nation from the former Eastern Block ( after the Czech Republic , which became a fully fledged member of the ESA on the 12th of November 2008 ) .
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 , and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects .
of course , Poland &apos;s path to the space had begun much earlier .
Polish b@@ off@@ ins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War , but were not always met with understanding .
I look back , for instance , to the lecture of A Stern@@ feld in Warsaw &apos;s astronomy observatory , who , on the 6th of December 1933 , presented ideas on his pioneering work Entry into space .
the thoughts of the young engineer ( born 1905 ) left his audience cold , and years later Stern@@ feld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gad@@ om@@ ski had shown an interest in his work .
in 1934 , for his work Entry into space , Stern@@ feld received the Robert E@@ sn@@ ault @-@ Pel@@ terie and Andre Louis Hirsch prize in France .
the above mentioned Dr. Jan Gad@@ om@@ ski ( 1899 - 1966 ) later became a strong promoter of astronomy and astr@@ onau@@ tics .
he published hundreds of articles in Polish journals , and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects .
Gad@@ om@@ ski became a world @-@ known promoter of astr@@ onau@@ tics and his contribution was , notably , recognised when a crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him .
in 1925 , Poland had already built a hand@@ car which was supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine .
unfortunately , both the project &apos;s designer , and the project &apos;s details , are unknown .
it is not even clear , whether the rocket was intended to start the hand@@ car or to slow it down .
information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time .
in 1933 the Polish artillery started their engagement in flying bombs .
the research was undertaken by the Weapons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof. Mi@@ ecz@@ ys@@ law Wolf@@ ke and Prof. Gu@@ sta@@ w Mok@@ r@@ zy@@ ck@@ i .
from the documents , it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests .
of course , the advance of the German army interrupted the research .
in 1937 , the concept of a photo@@ electric hom@@ ing rocket designed by engineer Roh@@ oz@@ inski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year The Ro@@ cket - air torped@@ o and flying rocket @-@ bomb appeared , authored by L@@ eli@@ wy @-@ Kr@@ y@@ w@@ ob@@ lock@@ i .
both projects were destined for military use of rocket engines .
immediately prior to the War , all projects for military use of rocket technologies were over@@ seen by the Pro@@ visional Scientific Advisory Board ( T@@ ym@@ cz@@ as@@ owy Komit@@ et Dor@@ ad@@ c@@ zo @-@ Nau@@ kow@@ y ) that coordinated all the work .
the Board was appointed in 1937 , but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War .
further work devoted to astr@@ onau@@ tics appeared in the Polish Press after the War thanks to the Polish Astron@@ au@@ tics Company ( Pol@@ skie Tow@@ arz@@ yst@@ wo Astron@@ aut@@ y@@ cz@@ ne ) .
the first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine Problems in 1954 , in which four in @-@ depth articles are on the subject of astr@@ onau@@ tics .
in one of these , by Prof. Sub@@ ot@@ o@@ wicz , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would dedicate itself to astr@@ onau@@ tics .
at the time , there were already projects underway for artificial satellites and it was clear that cosmic research was an emerging sector .
from the beginning of 1956 , the Polish Astron@@ au@@ tics Company ( P@@ TA ) sought entry to the International Astron@@ au@@ tics Federation ( est . 1951 ) and by autumn the P@@ TA was already a full member .
in the following year , the P@@ TA &apos;s first chairman , Kazimierz Zar@@ ank@@ ie@@ wicz ( 1902 - 1959 ) was appointed Deputy Chairman for the International Astron@@ au@@ tics Federation .
he served in this capacity until his death in 1959 .
from 1956 , the P@@ TA played a significant role in the successful development of meteorological rockets RM ( Rak@@ i@@ eta Meteor@@ olog@@ icz@@ na ) , which became the first Polish rocket to enable scientific research .
the first RM @-@ 1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 1958 .
the rocket , with a ceiling of 1800 metres , measured around 80 cm in length and weighed a little under 5 kg .
later , the improved RM @-@ 1A version was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initiated for the two @-@ stage RM @-@ 2 rocket in the B@@ led@@ ow@@ sky Desert .
the rocket was 1.4 metres in length and weighed approximately 11.@@ 5 kg .
a further development model was designed for real scientific work - the RM @-@ 34 rocket was to reach 14.@@ 5 km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude winds .
of course , in 1962 further research was stopped .
the successor to the RM rocket type was the Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 1 rocket , developed from 1962 to 1965 .
the rocket was designed as a two @-@ stage rocket , with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 3@@ 2.5 kg .
three models were developed ( designated Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 1A , -@@ 1@@ B , and -@@ 1@@ C ) , which differ@@ ed in the room available for scientific apparatus .
in the Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 1A rocket , a space of 0.4 litres was available , Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 1@@ B had 0.@@ 34 litres , and Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 1@@ C had 0.@@ 62 litres .
the maximum altitude for all three models was 37@@ km .
between 1965 and 1968 , the development of Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 2 was underway in the Aer@@ onau@@ tics Institute , with its first launch tests in October 1970 .
the Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg , and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60@@ km .
subsequently built models were the Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 2@@ H and Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 3 .
Poland &apos;s admission to CO@@ SPAR ( Committee for Space Research ) in 1960 should be mentioned , as well as the appointment of a national CO@@ SPAR board two years later .
Poland also participated in the Inter@@ kosmo@@ s space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satellites , and in 1978 , the Polish pilot Mi@@ ros@@ law Her@@ mas@@ ze@@ wski became the second inter@@ cos@@ mon@@ aut after Vladimir Rem@@ kov .
abolishing the legislation on public works is not the solution .
last week the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works .
the resolution caused lively public debate .
it will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective .
liber@@ ally oriented financial systems in the EU , just as those in the globalised world , are based on the principle of an unregulated economic competition .
its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves .
the cause is the principle of free trade and free , completely unregulated movement of private capital together with uncontrolled financial speculation .
due to significant labour cost differences ( salaries ) there is pressure on prices .
on this basis , it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods , &quot; the rug is pulled &quot; from under the competition &apos;s prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits .
on a wider scale , this means most businesses must move production abroad , import cheaply from abroad , or close down . the result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies .
since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase .
the whole situation is bol@@ stered by the businessman &apos;s complete unwillingness to pay taxes , which would alleviate the economical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit .
the situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data .
the ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations , where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition , aiming to artificially lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment .
in other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while disregarding the drop in social standards .
this occurs chiefly in amendments to existing law .
the aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dictated by private capital , especially in terms of salaries .
on one hand , this economic system of force , in case of long @-@ term unemployment , on the other , restricted employee rights in the workplace .
this yields growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich .
in Germany there are already a host of food hand @-@ out centres for the poor , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages .
the number of these people is already in the millions .
in the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy , it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage .
just such a scandal was revealed in the case of auxiliary staff in the Bundestag .
the austerity measures for all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation , where people are pressur@@ ed by a catastrophic drop in living standards to emig@@ rate as it was in the 19th century , or to e@@ ke out an existence on starvation wages on the edge of society , in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment .
at this point we have to ask where this may come from ?
if it is to come from other EU states , then poverty is being shifted from one country to another , or it will not come at all , because Chinese , Indian , Brazilian , Turkish , Moroccan , Egyptian , and African labour is still at a fraction of European wages .
this applies to all of Latin America .
liberal theory and the Media inc@@ ess@@ antly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin .
private capital cru@@ elly insists on the viewpoint that the State must not intervene in the economy .
ther@@ eupon , we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own selfish ends .
here , the answer must be yes .
the proof is the existence of the almost omni@@ potent , and in all states , omni@@ present lobby .
the result is a desperate situation manifest@@ ing itself through corruption , through mutual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is punishable .
in Germany the situation is such that state ministries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms , who are basically connected with industry .
these laws are then approved in the Bundestag .
real power does not come from the people as the Western @-@ style constitutions claim , but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests .
it is clear that liber@@ ally @-@ orientated democracies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by App@@ ian in his work on the Roman Republic Crisis in the time of Cesar and Pomp@@ ei : &quot; the State was already long in complete de@@ generation and its offices taken by force .
with bri@@ bery , illegal acquisition of benefits , and with stones or swords .
bri@@ bery and corruption were rife and un@@ hindered , and the people would vote for a result which had been bought &quot; ... &quot; people with principles did not run for office , so on one occasion the whole deb@@ acle meant the state went eight months without consul@@ s .. &quot; .. &quot; There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being auto@@ cracy , and an energetic man should be elected . &quot; App@@ ian had Pomp@@ ei in mind , but it was Cesar who changed democracy for auto@@ cracy permanently .
the conclusion , just as in antiquity , the current society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole .
private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole .
the outcome is now , as it was then , an unprecedented dec@@ ad@@ ence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms .
the caus@@ ality of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the misguided liberalisation of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries .
the current state of affairs , when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liberalised democracy as an inter@@ lu@@ de , can expect its next cycle .
the particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives , humanitarian and social disasters , which we are already witnessing , as well as crimes against humanity , as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history .
the abolition of the law on public works is not the answer , at least not in the long term .
under the pressure of economic competition , internationally as well as within Europe , the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population &apos;s living standards .
this pattern is thus systemic .
to address this , there are targeted political and social reforms , which strengthen the state &apos;s capital participation in the economy , increase the people &apos;s influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state .
Israel : chaos Lab .
&quot; nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could , &quot; from St@@ ing &apos;s Fra@@ gile , where one of the main verses from the refrain is &quot; L@@ est we forget how fragile we are . &quot;
&quot; if my sons did not want war , there would be none , &quot; said the dying Gut@@ le Schn@@ apper , wife of Mayer Am@@ schel Rothschild in 1849 .
the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip , as always , has sparked a lot of reaction .
some stand by Israel , arguing it has the right to self @-@ defence , and Palestinians are portrayed as terrorists , while others support the Palestinians , claiming racism by the Israeli state , claiming that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Arabs , and that Israel is a terrorist state .
I do not want to dwell , in these repeated periodic waves of killing , on who is the transgres@@ sor and who is the victim , after all , today &apos;s inhabitants of Israel , including the self @-@ governing territories , were born into the current political situation , and did not live through the start of the violence .
I would like to offer the readers a pe@@ ek behind the scenes , a look at whom , most of all , this 95 @-@ year long tension is serving ( starting from Bal@@ four &apos;s declaration in November 1917 ) on this small piece of land in the Middle East .
some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts , while others are derived from my own understanding of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in modern history .
human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power .
in every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon .
what is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path independently , or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre @-@ calculated goal .
we must accept that we live in a time when the world &apos;s wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentration of wealth and the power it exu@@ des could not happen in one generation &apos;s lifespan .
among these astronom@@ ically rich families , one stands out , which could be considered the puppet master ( whether someone else stands above them , I am unsure , but I would not rule it out ) - the Roth@@ schil@@ ds .
not much is written about them .
understandably .
the first news agency ( Reuters ) they bought in the 90 &apos;s of the 19th century , in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high criminality , which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power , increasing wealth , or both .
they hold majority stakes in almost every central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either waging or preparing for war ( before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries , after Iraq it was 5 , after the overthrow of K@@ addafi 4 remained , but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government ) .
whoever attempted to def@@ y this family died .
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to the Rothschild Bank of America , and during the Civil War he began to issue his own ( that is state @-@ issued ) money and was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre .
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to close the Fed ( Federal Reserve ) , and was killed in 1963 , Congres@@ sman Louis Mc@@ Fad@@ den was poisoned in 1936 , after he had intended to sue the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 1929 .
their thirst for global power led in the years of 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a three @-@ world @-@ war plan by the fre@@ emas@@ on leader of the 3@@ 3rd degree , Albert Pike .
the first war was to remove the large monarch@@ ic state bodies in Europe , the second was to remove colonial rule , especially from Great Britain , and the third will reduce the world &apos;s population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people ( this number of slaves will suffice for their comfort and luxury , and will not use up so many resources ) , the creation of one universal faith ( ec@@ umen@@ ism is just an appeti@@ ser for this solution ) , and finally the seizing of absolute power .
the method , which the group of wealthy families with the Roth@@ schil@@ ds leading the way , employ is the ins@@ tigation of crises , followed by the offering of a solution ( order ab ch@@ ao - order from chaos ) .
these solutions are false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( vi@@ de establishment of the Fed , so that the crisis of 1907 would not be repeated ) .
thus , having succeeded in assassin@@ ating Ferdinand , the Habsburg heir to the Austro @-@ Hungarian throne , in Sarajevo thereby unle@@ ashing World War I , they destroyed ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia with the Bolsh@@ evi@@ k revolution .
the First World War ended abruptly , militarily and economically un@@ substantiated , with German capit@@ ulation ( the war was no longer needed to destroy ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia ) and the central European powers of Austria @-@ Hungary were subsequently dismantled .
to facilitate the inception of the Second World War , they allowed bankers and politicians to create a latent conflict situation by sadd@@ ling Germany with huge war repar@@ ations , thereby making a radic@@ alist example of the impoverished masses , it remained only to introduce a sufficiently convincing cul@@ prit and a leader with a simple solution , while also creating a multi @-@ racial Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play , and indeed did , the role of a fifth colony , once the war had been ign@@ ited .
at the end of the 19th Century , the Roth@@ schil@@ ds instigated the establishment of the Zi@@ onist movement , one branch of which stro@@ ve to form the Jewish State , seeking out an area of historic Ju@@ dea , Jerusalem , to make its capital ( the Return to Zion ) .
the aforementioned Bal@@ four Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine , where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population .
terrorist attacks occurred on both sides .
world War II broke out , and whether Hitler broke free from the le@@ ash , which international bankers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , is difficult to determine , nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world &apos;s acceptance of the Jewish State .
Israel was officially formed in 1948 , and just as the war repar@@ ations for World War II were layed on Germany , the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war &apos;s hot@@ bed .
provided the international bankers succeed , the Jewish Nation , as with the second , will be the victims on the front line , now together with the Arabic - or more generally , Muslim - population of the Middle East .
Israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of dis@@ cord and chaos not only within the country , but on an international level ( just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel ) .
who is the wrong @-@ do@@ er and who is the victim in the Palestine @-@ Israel conflict , where injustice breeds injustice in an endless cycle of violence , while everything began from the greed of a few and their lust for global power ?
here , we must differentiate between Israel &apos;s general population and their leaders , because , just as it happens here , the international bankers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for .
Israel &apos;s current prime minister , Netanyahu &apos; the haw@@ k &apos; , is a typical example of a fascist politician , loyal to the international bankers , who does everything to instig@@ ate war with Iran , which would , due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the Hor@@ mu@@ z Strait , where 20 % of the world &apos;s oil must sail ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world &apos;s economy .
in what light stand the words , spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 : &quot; all we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . &quot;
the New World Order in their eyes is one of master and slave .
a world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a handful of financial aristoc@@ rats .
a world , where each new @-@ born is impl@@ anted with a chip , which makes their existence completely sub@@ jug@@ ated .
&quot; he also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his foreh@@ ead , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the be@@ ast or the number of his name .
if anyone has insight , let him calculate the number of the be@@ ast ,
for it is man &apos;s number . his number is six hundred and sixty six . &quot;
AR@@ GO : when things are at their worst - call Hollywood .
in November 1979 , a mob of Islamic student demonstrators took over the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage .
they were to be released in exchange for the over@@ thrown Shah Mohammad Re@@ za Pah@@ la@@ vi , who fled after the revolution to the USA , which had actually supported his regime for several decades .
for the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Shah over@@ board , because this would seriously jeopardise the trust of other allied countries .
the release of the hostages in Iran , where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the the@@ oc@@ ratic regime , could not be achieved .
this was a blow to the prestige of the United States , which was later compounded by the fi@@ asco of attempting to free the hostages by force .
the incarcer@@ ated diplomats were finally released after 444 days , following negotiations medi@@ ated by the Algerian government .
their or@@ deal provoked a wave of solidarity and anti @-@ Iranian feelings at home .
the deb@@ acle in Iran significantly influenced Jimmy Carter &apos;s loss with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections .
the film Ar@@ go , directed by the actor Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck , re@@ counts one episode in this story , which brought America a small victory .
just before the embassy was seized , six employees escaped .
after some perip@@ et@@ eia , they ended up in the Canadian ambassador &apos;s residence .
the CIA , in collaboration with the Canadian authorities , succeeded in getting them out of Iran , helped by an extravagant cover story - they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew , who were surve@@ ying locations for a sci @-@ fi block@@ buster .
a combination of genres
the plan , conceived by &quot; ex@@ filtration &quot; expert , Tony Men@@ dez , required the assistance of Hollywood .
for the story to be believed , the film project was reported on in specialist magazines , press conferences were organised , and the fic@@ titious production company had a real office .
the details of the operation were , for a long time , kept secret ; the film draws on the memories of Tony Men@@ dez .
Aff@@ l@@ eck &apos;s film is a peculiar mix of genres .
on one hand , there is a realistic inc@@ isive political thriller , and at the same time a &quot; cap@@ er movie , &quot; with small victories and double @-@ crossing - another example would be Ocean &apos;s Ele@@ ven .
the mood altern@@ ates in the film - on one side , sharp documentary @-@ style sequences in Tehran ( the title sequence shows iconic photos from news of the time , relating to the same events portrayed in the film - there are no big differences ) .
on the other hand , lighter sections from Hollywood , lac@@ ed with irony and a little exaggeration .
then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables , in office corridors , over the phone ...
Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck has managed to restart his career in extraordinary style .
the deri@@ ded actor has become a respected director , and his acting is no longer the target of ironic comments .
AR@@ GO is his third big @-@ screen movie , following his dark crime movie G@@ one Baby G@@ one ( 2007 ) and the thriller The Town ( 2010 ) .
it is also Aff@@ l@@ eck &apos;s first picture , which does not take place in the director &apos;s hometown of Boston .
the atmospheric feel in different locations is one of the characteristics , which took his earlier films above Hollywood standards .
Aff@@ l@@ eck shows it in Ar@@ go , where Tehran is &quot; featured &quot; by Canada .
the best scenes of the film take place in the streets , in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the siege on the embassy is impressively lu@@ cid , creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come flooding in , as history suddenly takes a turn .
a similar effect is achieved by Aff@@ l@@ eck and his team in the fic@@ titious scenes ( the fake staff at the Tehran baz@@ aar ) .
too much action in too many places
the director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many nail @-@ biting scenes for the film .
what little there is , is worked well , with some occasional embell@@ ishments to reality - these do not all come off so elegantly ( the scene , where a looming crisis is aver@@ ted at Tehran airport by a phone call in America , followed by a chase on the runway seems quite far @-@ fetched ) .
AR@@ GO &apos;s weakness is its divergence , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places .
Alan Ar@@ kin and John Good@@ man play their roles as the Hollywood assistants with great charm ; their characters deserve more room , and are not by far the only ones in this film .
Aff@@ l@@ eck &apos;s film loses the dramatic pull a little , it is a film , which can be watched with reasonable interest , its production and retro @-@ style are evocative of thri@@ ll@@ ers from the 70 &apos;s .
it does not really captiv@@ ate .
as a reminder of history &apos;s particular ways and a testimony to how exaggerated the views are on the all @-@ powerful all @-@ controlling secret services , this will do .
rules for blowing up ballo@@ ons , for bananas and a circus
the www.@@ ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ ky@@ .com server , which issues a poll every year on the most absurd bank charge , has now decided to announce a competition for &quot; the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU . &quot;
&quot; we were prompted by the latest story , where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe &apos;s largest companies , &quot; Patri@@ k Nach@@ er , the poll &apos;s organiser , told Pra@@ vo .
among the latest nominated absur@@ di@@ ties , for instance , is the recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women .
until now , women were favoured in life insurance prices , because they constitute a lower risk for insurers .
&quot; other unbelievable ideas from the EU can be nominated by anyone until the end of the year .
the actual voting will then take place until the end of February 2013 , &quot; informed Nach@@ er .
among the controversial EU regulations , we might include the mandatory addition of bio @-@ ingredients to fuel , which consequently harms the environment , the ban on reliable mercury ther@@ mom@@ eters just because they contain a relatively small quantity of a toxic substance , or the rules on the size of chicken cages , which significantly raised egg prices this year .
the ban on the use of the term &quot; sp@@ readable butter &quot; and the withdrawal of classic light bulbs from sale had previously come under criticism .
first rate bananas are to measure 14 cen@@ timet@@ res
the Union &apos;s machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobbying group , whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states &apos; interests ( just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being vet@@ oed ) .
the lobby &apos;s interests were , for example , that bananas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the EU , and were not to display and &quot; anom@@ alous cur@@ v@@ ature . &quot;
the European Commission defended itself , saying that it was only harmonising existing dis@@ jo@@ in@@ ted national standards , which complicated trading .
norms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been sof@@ tened by the EU despite opposition from certain states , referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives .
one possible prize @-@ winner in the poll may be the last year &apos;s EU regulation according to which inf@@ lat@@ able ballo@@ ons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not infl@@ ate them without parental supervision .
here , the EU pointed to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , ballo@@ ons are one of the main causes of child suff@@ ocation .
a similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blowers .
strange ideas are conceived at home too
fairly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU , who holds an official post , may not use the term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece , and instead the acronym FYROM ( Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) should be used .
the Ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ ky@@ .com server in collaboration with the Liberal Economist Association , La@@ issez F@@ aire , also nominated , aside from the aforementioned absur@@ di@@ ties , for example the Union &apos;s regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state .
the EU stipulated the maximum volumes of food provisions , which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union .
the Czech Republic thereafter exceeded , for instance , the permitted volume of mush@@ room preserves , which incurred a high penalty .
the poll &apos;s organisers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coastline , or the suggestion of allocating funding for a request for funding .
these ideas did not come from Brussels , however , but from Prague .
&quot; we are handicapped because we do not have the sea .
we are asking the European Union for a refund , &quot; declared the minister for agriculture , back in autumn 2004 , Jaro@@ slav Pal@@ as ( C@@ SSD ) .
his argument was that there had been a good harvest of cereals , and due to the so @-@ called buy @-@ out interventions , the state &apos;s warehouses were full and were forced to export .
the Czech Republic is further away from a port , so according to Pal@@ as the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euros .
the European Commission finally met the CR halfway by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea .
funding to subsidise funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development &apos;s minister , Pavel Nem@@ ec ( US @-@ D@@ EU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels .
EU : bizarre legislation is the exception
regulations may well become the target of criticism among member states , but the EU &apos;s efforts at regulation , more effective operation , and development of the entire Union deserve recognition , according to a number of experts .
a more important issue , according to experts , is the drawing of EU funds on projects , which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the European integration , but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting .
emotions fl@@ are among Czechs when , just as other countries in the Union , the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products , in which it does not always succeed .
the Czechs fought for six years with the Germans and Austrians to protect the labelling of their ol@@ om@@ ou@@ cke t@@ var@@ uz@@ ky , however the tu@@ zem@@ sky rum , whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century here , had to be renamed tu@@ zem@@ ak by the manufacturers .
the app@@ ellation of rum can only be given to products distilled from cane sugar , and not sugar beet .
Car@@ ls@@ bad waf@@ ers , Poh@@ or@@ el@@ ick@@ y and Tre@@ bon@@ sky car@@ p , and Zat@@ ec hops have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU , alongside the world @-@ renowned f@@ eta cheese and gor@@ gon@@ z@@ ola , German mar@@ zip@@ an from Lub@@ eck , and Parma ham .
the EU &apos;s stamp of protection can also be proudly shown on Par@@ dub@@ ice g@@ inger@@ bread and Hor@@ ick@@ y tubes .
people want me to save the republic , but I am an amateur , says Ok@@ am@@ ura
Senator , how does a person decide they want to run for President ?
this is not about me being a sen@@ ator or president .
if everything in our country worked without problems , then I would not be running for any post .
I cannot watch any longer the country having been robbed over the past twenty years , thieves roaming about there and people &apos;s taxes and retirement age increasing .
I had no ambition to be a politician .
when I see something I do not like , though , I try to find a solution to change things .
since I have already turned forty , and I am an independent non @-@ party man , I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for sen@@ ator or president .
you have already reached the Senate , but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle .
are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this ?
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Castle based on the results in the Senate &apos;s elections .
later , I added that if I were elected as sen@@ ator , I would be standing for president .
my goal , though , is not the post , the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised .
therefore , I need the greatest influence , and the strongest mandate possible .
the trouble is not just that as a nation we swear in the pub or at the television , but that we tr@@ ample anyone , who wants to try to change things .
the Media add to this , misleading the public , and mist@@ aking freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
for example , I was allegedly bri@@ bing reporters , or I was allegedly an advisor of Ji@@ ri Par@@ ou@@ bek .
let &apos;s talk about your vision .
you set out on your castle siege with a thesis on the material and criminal responsibilities of politics , and a retro@@ active financial disclosure of assets over twenty million .
you need to change the law for this .
as president , though , you do not have this power , and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws .
how are you going to solve this ?
when I lob@@ bi@@ ed , as a citizen , for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through .
the problem is political squab@@ bling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right , it will be deliberately rejected , causing delays for the public .
as an independent non @-@ party man , I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides .
the advantage I hold is that without the political pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hol@@ ing or dog@@ mas I can take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it .
do you see yourself as a person from the right , or the left ?
from the Czech viewpoint , it seems they tend to put me to the left .
for me , it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right .
the important part for me is moving forward .
it is not about whether someone is from the left or right , I just want to bring people together .
I always support any good public solutions , even if they are put forward by the K@@ SCM or the O@@ DS , and , in the same way , I will oppose bad ideas .
you get angry when someone calls you a populist .
are you not confirming this with what you have stated ?
when you make a company business plan , you also have some ideal goal and vision .
you try to come close to it .
some may call it populism , but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts .
but without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slogans .
you will not last long in politics with that .
or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them , that you will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ?
I have no alternative .
I need to convince politicians , reporters , and the public , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through .
if I were elected president , it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast , where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians , civil servants , judges , and the Attorney General .
and , as the case may be , they would need to explain why they did not want this .
when there is a strong figure to point out the issues , it just needs some pressure on the political scene .
take for instance the direct election of the president , it was achieved thanks to public pressure .
I will say frankly that I am an amateur , I am not a genius or an intellectual .
I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision .
I have just started out in politics , and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda .
I will try to make things progress , but it if does not work out , in six years I will finish and return to the private sector .
it sounds a little like Ok@@ am@@ ura is trying to save the Czech Republic .
I am no sa@@ vi@@ our .
I know that alone I will not achieve anything , so I have asked acquaintances , whether they would run for the sen@@ ate .
I went to Radi@@ m Jan@@ cura , who declined due to his workload .
so I , at least , support investigative journalist , Jana Lor@@ enco@@ va , who uncovered fraudulent activity with light heating oil .
I put myself forward , because people are really dis@@ cont@@ ented , but now I have my doubts .
sixty percent of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment .
in the sen@@ ate , there are only two independ@@ ents , including me .
people have voted for a sen@@ ate that will make it difficult to enforce changes .
nonetheless , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of mayors or regional council presidents .
are you considering having your own party ?
I have not considered it yet , because I have neither the time to verify that every party member has a clean background , nor the money to do it .
I have no money even for a presidential campaign , my transparent account holds just 20 thousand .
you have no money ?
you are talking about financial dis@@ closures , but what is yours like ?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million .
in Prague , I have land worth around 25 million , an apartment worth ten million , another apartment worth eight million , an artwork collection worth around ten million , an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million , a Sko@@ da Super@@ b worth a million , and I have a few million in my account .
I have the Aston Martin , by the way , because it was my dream as a boy - I always liked James Bond , who drove the car , was gall@@ ant with women and also fought against evil and vil@@ la@@ iny .
you drive an Aston Martin , have assets worth 60 million , but you have no money for a campaign ?
you say you want to change the Republic , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
this does not inspire much confidence .
I do not have 15 million for a campaign .
should I take out a loan ?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign .
the fact that I do not have any sponsors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme .
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign .
the expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a sen@@ ator .
however , I would not be able to live on it , for instance , I could not pay for my son &apos;s English school , which costs 30 thousand a month .
if I were only interested in making money , I would not be standing for election .
so you will still be in business so that you can make a living ?
did you not say you would be putting this on hold ?
this depends on the rate of pay .
as I promised , my activities have been partially reduced .
for example , my deputy is taking over as the CEO of the travel agency in spring .
people would like me to be a Sam@@ ar@@ itan , who saves the Republic .
but I must also live off something .
as a businessman , what would you usually make monthly ?
two hundred to 400 thousand , which I still do .
and if I became president , then I would end my business activity .

the M@@ VR@@ DV architects prove that true adventures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse and the recently erected Bücher@@ berg ( literally &quot; book mountain &quot; ) - 2 photos
&quot; I think the building is fun , looks futuristic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at , &quot; said Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ ig , a passer @-@ by at the road @-@ side .
and Stefan Sper@@ mon , IT technician in a major firm based nearby commented : &quot; it &apos;s definitely a thing of beauty , the building . &quot;
however , I do wonder why people would need another library in this day and age .
everyone has the Internet , an iPad and e@@ Books .
no @-@ one goes into one of these old @-@ style libraries voluntarily nowadays , or am I wrong ?
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , a sleep@@ y town outside the gates of Rotterdam , which barely merits a visit , is a special record @-@ holder .
the 80,000 @-@ resident municipality has the lowest literacy rate in the whole of the Netherlands .
in order to counteract this as@@ in@@ ine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to recreate the seven fic@@ titious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty , painted reinforced concrete miniatures .
the success of the education offensive was limited .
and so the city fathers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statistics : a library had to be built !
win@@ y Maas of the Rotterdam @-@ based architectural firm M@@ VR@@ DV , master of aud@@ acious bar charts and producer of humorous and often cynical buildings , took the project on with his customary compos@@ ure , and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a gr@@ in on his face .
and with the judging panel still looking at him with bewil@@ der@@ ment , shr@@ ug@@ ging their shoulders , the imper@@ tin@@ ent Maas stacked his chosen pro@@ ps by order of size to form a pyramid and rounded off his presentation - now suitably backed up with action - with the words : &quot; dear Municipality ! &quot;
so this is my suggestion for the Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse Book Mountain - for the so @-@ called Bo@@ ek@@ enberg !
nine years later , the 30 @-@ million @-@ euro mountain has been lifted up .
it is part of a revit@@ alisation project , which also includes an underground car park , a supermarket , a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and terraced houses , with a total of 50 dwellings .
at the beginning of November , the Bücher@@ berg was awarded second place in the &quot; Best Library of NL 2012 &quot; competition .
in addition , the project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 .
thus , the fac@@ eless small @-@ town ret@@ ort , that until now had nothing more to offer than a post @-@ modern pedestrian area and a st@@ unn@@ ingly ugly town hall , behind whose white facades one would expect to find a dairy plant , has been bol@@ stered by a piece of contemporary architecture .
first and foremost , however , Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse now has its first public cultural building in the history of its existence .
the long journey to the book
the first impression : the Eldorado of books beneath a cheese dome .
there is in fact a lift that climbs through the centre of the mountain massif , however , the true jo@@ ys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the topo@@ graphy on foot .
the interior space , glazed throughout , is bright and open , the fired clin@@ ker floors and the elegant street lamps speak the unmistakable language of a public town square .
the urban ambiance is perfect .
you are already on the lookout for a park bench , a dog , and boys and girls playing football .
and everywhere there are books , books , books .
&quot; normally book shelves run along the facade , and in the centre there is a large , dark space , which is usually unpleasant and im@@ personal , &quot; says win@@ y Maas .
we turned the classical spatial configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out .
the interior of the Bücher@@ berg is cleverly used : in the centre there are offices , an Internet library , a chess club , an environmental centre and the central technical support room .
one particularly special feature are the black book shelves , which simultaneously act as wall cl@@ adding , parap@@ ets and rail@@ ings for the stair@@ way .
the appearance , feel and scent are foreign .
even die @-@ hard architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown construction materials .
&quot; here we wanted to work with recyclable materials , &quot; explained Jo@@ op Troub@@ or@@ st , Project Manager for the Municipality of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , on request of the Standard .
and thus one day we stum@@ bled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture , on a Fris@@ ian farm .
for many years , millim@@ etre @-@ thick artificial fabric has been used in green@@ houses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer .
it is inexpensive and saves time .
the thin textile lasts for two seasons and is then disposed of as bulk waste .
for the library , the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four @-@ cen@@ timet@@ re @-@ thick boards .
under heat and pressure , the so @-@ called Land@@ bou@@ w plastic ( KL@@ P ) changes colour to a dark , homogeneous and robust material , that smells like a mixture of new car smell and the smell of trainers .
after 105 steps you have reached the summit .
at the end of the 500 @-@ meter @-@ long journey , you are rewarded in the Literature Café , not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also with Dutch cro@@ qu@@ ettes and pot@@ ted fic@@ us trees .
these provide atmosphere , but most importantly , regulate the air humidity in the literary mountain range .
donations for the new soul
&quot; you would hardly believe it , but this building , in spite of the many glass panels , is a showcase project in the area of ecology , &quot; said Troub@@ or@@ st .
it is heated and cooled using geothermal heat .
although the Bücher@@ berg has a glass cover , the sun only shines only briefly into the interior , even on sunny days .
the broad , laminated wood glue beams positioned at right @-@ angles to the glass facade , provide shade and absorb the majority of the sunlight .
the indoor temperature is very pleasant .
the rest is taken care of by fully automatic roller blinds .
Stefan Sper@@ mon , initially a sceptic of the IT sector , has already vent@@ ured into the new library .
Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ ig has also visited already .
so too has T@@ CM @-@ teacher , C@@ ynthia Bog@@ arde , who even refers to the Bo@@ ek@@ enberg as Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse &apos;s &quot; long overdue soul . &quot;
the reason : at the inauguration just a few weeks ago , every citizen was invited to donate a book from his / her personal collection .
this was , for the time being , to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently there are 70,000 items .
the concept has been a success .
the shelves are full to capacity .
&quot; nothing is worse than a half @-@ empty library , &quot; said architect win@@ y Maas .
&quot; I think that , thanks to our invitation , every resident now has a certain bond with this new building .
everyone knows that their book is part of the building .
even if it &apos;s just for decoration .
as such , M@@ VR@@ DV have succeeded in mastering the master discipline that specialist jargon refers to as the formation of identity .
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse has written literary history .
however young and un@@ educated it may be .
this is ultimately a starting point for identity .
Sz@@ abo : &quot; Germans must play a greater role &quot;
in the vote on the incorporation of Palestine , Germany abstained from voting .
according to Stephen Sz@@ abo , Expert in US @-@ European relations , in so doing Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line .
Deutsche Welle : at the beginning of the week , Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the Palestinians &apos; application for observer status within the United Nations .
however , Berlin subsequently abstained from voting .
why ?
Stephen Sz@@ abo : Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza .
now , however , due to their special relationship with Israel , Germany must be cautious .
at the same time , however , I do not believe that it supports the American position either .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel .
during the uprising in Libya in March 2011 , Germany likewise abstained from voting , when it came to establishing a no @-@ fly zone .
this was ultimately implemented by NATO .
does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs ?
yes , it does .
that is because it has just re@@ organised its foreign policy , indeed moving away from a policy that was , so to speak , managed by the USA , in favour of a German foreign policy .
this situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardised policy .
the Germans thus find themselves caught between two fronts .
it is expected of them that they play a more independent role , yet this is something that they are not accustomed to .
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role , but they are en route to a &quot; more normal &quot; foreign policy .
a foreign policy similar to that of France , or Great Britain .
so what specifically does a &quot; normal &quot; foreign policy entail , from a German perspective ?
it shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters , which are independent of those of the USA or European partners .
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy , that is , by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia , China or the Near East .
Germany &apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests .
have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Near East conflict and their voting in the UN ?
on the one hand , Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East , and particularly in the Gulf States .
therefore it must be careful not to affront the public , but also the elite in the Arabic countries .
in any case , this plays a role .
however , I wouldn &apos;t want to ascri@@ be too much weight to this . this is not an entirely one @-@ sided relationship .
nonetheless , it does play an important role in Germany &apos;s considerations .
has Germany damaged its relations with the USA , by abstaining to vote on important decisions , such as the vote on Palestine ?
I think that in Europe , and even in the USA , a great understanding for the German position prevails .
therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fra@@ cture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya .
perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect .
after all , it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered .
in Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative .
the USA , on the other hand , have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto .
are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations ?
due to the American domestic policy , these differences have always existed .
I think that secretly , the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation .
however , due to the political situation here , the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly .
it is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear .
if you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu , Obama is really not quite so enth@@ used by Netanjahu &apos;s policies .
does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other ?
I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the Germans .
it would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and standardised European policy , which is currently not the case .
thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position .
this is precisely what they are doing with the Euro .
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe towards a standardised European position .
this is , of course , no simple task for Germany , on account of its relations with Israel .
this has always been a sensitive subject .
yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role .
does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role ?
or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult ?
Germany is still not used to it , the country continues to be uncomfortable and , for obvious reasons , still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role .
if we look at the Euro crisis for example , every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role , various anti @-@ German feelings become apparent .
this does not make matters simple for the Germans .
this is actually the same old problem : one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries .
from this stance , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA .
it must be receptive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions , and this is not easy .
the influence of the USA over European politics is continually diminishing , yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum , so who is filling the gap ?
the Germans will simply have to play a greater role .
even if they do not like it , even if it is uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c &apos;est la vie !

&quot; brand protection &quot; in China : when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world @-@ famous brand , Polo Ralph La@@ uren likewise .
however , what is Armani Polo ?
behind this name hides a fully officially registered brand in China , however , one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies .
nonetheless , it is enjoying protection , provided the actual creators of the names do not sue .
and even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights .
&quot; it is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China , &quot; said Thomas P@@ att@@ loch , lawyer within the Taylor W@@ essing law firm , who specialises in copyright infringement in the Far East .
every week a new case lands on my desk .
all the copy@@ cats require are a few additional letters in order that they can register their brands .
thus Gu@@ cci simply becomes Lu @-@ Gu@@ cci , Pra@@ da @-@ K@@ ny is registered in place of Pra@@ da .
German companies are also &apos; legally &apos; copied in this manner , such as manufacturer of sporting apparel , Puma .
P@@ att@@ loch opens a file containing registrations with the trademark office in Peking .
on 14 September 2010 a Chinese company copyrighted the brand name Z@@ eg@@ na DF Puma there , an alias that also helps itself to the name of fashion retailer Er@@ men@@ eg@@ il@@ do Z@@ eg@@ na .
the fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property is well @-@ known .
in the major cities there are multi @-@ level department stores that sell counterfeit goods almost exclusively .
P@@ att@@ loch &apos;s cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office , fully officially , which is already protected elsewhere .
the Chinese call this &quot; Bang M@@ ing@@ pa@@ i , &quot; a passenger brand .
the word is based on &quot; Bang D@@ aku@@ an . &quot;
this refers to women who lat@@ ch onto rich men .
the Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrong@@ doing .
&quot; this harms business and we must fight against it , &quot; challenges P@@ att@@ loch .
&quot; the brand is watered down , its uniqueness disappears - the image damage is enormous . &quot;
the financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions , especially in the case of expensive flagship products .
according to information from market research company CL@@ SA , with a volume of 15 billion euros annually , China is the third largest market for luxury items , and the fastest growing .
however , the deletion of dubious entries in the trademark registry are difficult to achieve , and cost a pretty penny .
the process can last for up to nine years , with an uncertain outcome .
P@@ att@@ loch reports of instances whereby the court dis@@ misses cases , because after a long period of time , the name to which the objection is being raised has become a &quot; market reality . &quot;
if the complainant is un@@ lucky , he may even have to pay the pl@@ agi@@ ar@@ ist money for having infringed on his trademark in China , said P@@ att@@ loch .
sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here .
famous cases also relate to graphic elements .
in 2009 , Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer S@@ any , the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer Putz@@ meister .
even today , the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star .
Volvo @-@ purchaser Ge@@ ely originally used a blue and white logo that resem@@ bled the BMW logo ; the dispute was arbit@@ rated and Ge@@ ely was forced to change it .
fashion house Lac@@ o@@ ste lost a suit in China against copy@@ cats from Hong Kong and Singapore , who were using the famous crocodi@@ le looking in the other direction .
the Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrong@@ doing .
the CT@@ MO trademark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to limited staffing and equipment .
in the past year , however , things reportedly &quot; returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow . &quot;
thus the stock of un@@ processed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent .
almost 57@@ ,000 such cased were closed , 75 percent more than in the previous year .
nonetheless , there are still 8@@ 1,500 appeals waiting to be resolved in the office .
to remedy this is very expensive
as is so often the case in China , the figures are imposing .
in the past year , more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the CT@@ MO , almost one third more than in 2010 .
this is a record and means that China , for the tenth time in succession , is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications , informed the authority .
the same applies for the inventory of valid trademarks , totalling 5.5 million in number .
in 2011 , 1.8 billion yuan in fees were received .
put simply , this means that each application costs on average 1,@@ 280 yuan , or 160 euros .
to appeal against an application costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the German family business , Freudenberg .
for more than seven years , the group has been cont@@ esting against a Chinese pl@@ agi@@ ar@@ ist .
the Germans did in fact manage to expose the company &apos;s illegal manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts .
however , the copy@@ cat still secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand .
this is something we missed ourselves , as family names cannot be protected in Germany , said Han@@ no W@@ entz@@ ler , Chairman of the Board of Management at Freudenberg Chemical Speci@@ alities in Munich .
the CT@@ MO trademark office then also dismissed the Munich @-@ based company &apos;s appeal .
in the next two instances , Freudenberg was proven right , however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day .
you have to pay extremely careful attention .
the matter is now pending before the Supreme Court .
W@@ entz@@ ler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts .
however , he also says : &quot; the process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time , money and nerves . &quot;
the internal costs can barely be calculated , the company archive even had to look through century @-@ old records in order to provide proof .
five years ago Freudenberg un@@ successfully offered the opposing party a &quot; high six @-@ figure sum in euros &quot; as settlement .
&quot; this shows how much this is worth to us , &quot; says W@@ entz@@ ler .
the dangers in the Far East even threaten to sp@@ illing over , back into Europe .
particularly if im@@ it@@ ators secure unprotected brand names there .
for example , a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany .
this is a business sector that the group had long vac@@ ated , yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration .
&quot; you have to pay extremely careful attention , &quot; says W@@ entz@@ ler .
both he and P@@ att@@ loch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China .
it is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights , rather foreigners should also register &quot; everything &quot; that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well , &quot; said W@@ entz@@ ler .
otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registration fee .
in actual fact : if Freudenberg were to loose at the final hur@@ dle of its trademark drama , they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name , explained W@@ entz@@ ler .
or alternatively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector .
world AIDS day : stom@@ p , sing , help
in Heidelberg , the im@@ bon@@ gi choir is rehear@@ sing - and in the Sw@@ az@@ iland , AIDS orphans are delighted .
the history of a link that over@@ comes far more than a distance of 8,@@ 7@@ 33 kilometres .
first of all , the stamping : cow@@ boy boots , basketball shoes , ladies &apos; pumps and men &apos;s lo@@ af@@ ers attempt to find the beat on the parquet floor , and quickly do just that .
one @-@ two @-@ three @-@ four .
only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto , bass , tenor and soprano surge , beg@@ u@@ ile and ha@@ unt .
and Fi@@ ete H@@ opf , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old conductor , almost rises up out of his shoes as he brings the ensemble together with his smooth , yet wild gestures .
it is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the im@@ bon@@ gi Choir are practising a new song .
the fifteen singers , aging from 23 to 69 years old , range from human gene@@ tici@@ sts to the maintenance man .
&quot; om &apos;O@@ ban@@ i &quot; is by no means a simple piece , with each voice having a different text , and in an extremely foreign language at that : Zul@@ u , which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa , Botswana , Lesotho , Malawi , Mozambique and in parts of Sw@@ az@@ iland .
helping others to help themselves
there are around 34 million people infected with HIV around the world , as according to the estim@@ ations of UN@@ AIDS , the United Nations &apos; programme to battle AIDS .
of these , 2@@ 3.5 million live in South Africa .
in Sw@@ az@@ iland , there are 24@@ 5,000 AIDS orphans .
meanwhile , more than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive .
the Vo@@ ices for Africa Association has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i .
70 of these attend a secondary school .
for 15 or 20 euros per month , you can become a sponsor .
this guarantees the child money for school , a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the G@@ ogo Centre .
in Zul@@ u , im@@ bon@@ gi means stor@@ yt@@ eller or wor@@ shi@@ pper .
in this region , no @-@ one can speak the Bantu language flu@@ ently , but they can sing it .
for almost ten years the choir has been practising songs in this foreign , &apos; soft &apos; language , and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from : the South of Africa .
for an 8,@@ 7@@ 33 @-@ kilometre flight away from Heidelberg , in the north west of the Sw@@ az@@ iland Kingdom , lies the village of E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , which relies on the vocal power of the German choir .
forty percent are infected .
around 2,000 people live there , some still in simple mud and straw huts , and the majority of them are children .
more than 300 of them no longer have parents , as they succum@@ bed to the HIV virus .
in E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i you get a small fores@@ ha@@ dow of the illness from which all of Sw@@ az@@ iland is suffering : according to Unic@@ ef , the region has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expectancy in the world .
circum@@ c@@ ision , which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting the virus by half , is barely practised by the population .
more than forty percent of people in the Sw@@ az@@ iland carry the immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus , and dying in you mid @-@ thir@@ ties is by no means rare .
on a group trip to Africa in early 2005 , the Choir visited the village , but first and foremost , the Imb@@ ong@@ is saw many children on the streets , lacking not only in parental care but in practically everything else as well : food , clothing , education .
without a school leaving certificate , there are barely any opportunities , particularly in a poor country .
initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him / her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year .
however , just one year later , the choir established the &quot; Vo@@ ices for Africa &quot; Association , which since then has been looking after the AIDS orphans in E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i at an almost professional level .
facts on sexually transmitted infections .
what are the most important sexually transmitted diseases ?
bacterial ST@@ IS include sy@@ philis , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia and gon@@ or@@ rho@@ ea .
common viral ST@@ IS are HIV , human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses , her@@ pes gen@@ ital@@ is and hepatitis .
cr@@ abs and sc@@ ab@@ ies belong among the par@@ asi@@ tic ST@@ IS .
who are the main affected groups ?
sy@@ philis and gon@@ or@@ rho@@ ea occur primarily in men that have intercourse with other men .
the Robert Koch Institute understands that at least four in five of all sy@@ philis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men .
among heter@@ osexual adults , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infections , tr@@ ich@@ om@@ oni@@ asis , candi@@ di@@ asis ( fung@@ al ) , gon@@ or@@ rho@@ ea and human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses are frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases .
the spread of HIV among heter@@ osexual adults in this country is relatively low ; however , around 20 percent of newly contracted cases of HIV are found in this group .
among young people , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infections are much more common than in other population groups .
according to European surveys , three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
in this country , human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses are also frequently found in young people .
how has the number of infections developed ?
not all sexually transmitted diseases are noti@@ fiable .
according to the Robert Koch Institute , the number of sy@@ philis infections has more than doubled from 1,@@ 6@@ 97 cases in 2001 , to 3,@@ 6@@ 98 cases in 2011 .
the number of newly contracted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007 .
in 2011 there were around 2,@@ 700 cases .
this is around one tenth fewer than the previous year .
which symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease ?
the infectious diseases can cause ul@@ cers in the genital area , discomfort when ur@@ in@@ ating , discharge , lower abdomin@@ al pain and bli@@ sters or warts .
however , often they cause no pain or any other symptoms , thus remaining und@@ et@@ ected .
how can you protect yourself ?
con@@ doms can reduce the risk of contraction , however , they do not offer 100 % protection .
this is because occasionally , the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via sme@@ ar infections and close bodily contact .
therefore , first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners undergo regular examinations .
if diagnosed early , the majority of ST@@ IS can be cured and long @-@ term consequences avoided .
through sponsor@@ ships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany , the money all adds up .
&quot; in total , we have already sent around 200,000 euros to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , &quot; said Annette Lenn@@ art@@ z , Chair@@ person of the association .
in the village itself , Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ lam@@ ini , a self @-@ assured and asser@@ tive woman , manages the money from Germany .
she makes sure that the orphans have good accommodation , for example with one of their grand@@ mothers .
the gog@@ os , as the old ladies are called in Zul@@ u , are the pillars of the village .
some of them have up to 14 orphans living with them , providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes punc@@ tually every day , in their school uniforms .
anyone who doesn &apos;t have anyone left , arrives at the shelter with Kh@@ any@@ is@@ ile , a single woman who earns the same salary from the association as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day .
in addition , &quot; Vo@@ ices for Africa &quot; has established a sewing school , built two chicken co@@ ops and , together with the American health organisation , PSI , organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV .
this is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country , the best way of keeping things under wra@@ ps is if people are dead .
a king with 14 wives
&quot; AIDS is an absolute taboo subject , &quot; said Annette Lenn@@ art@@ z , &quot; because it is associated with sexuality . &quot;
this is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives .
the last absolute mon@@ arch of sub @-@ Saharan Africa , King M@@ sw@@ ati III . , is known for his excessive lifestyle .
poly@@ gam@@ y in place of democracy .
among other factors , the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially sanctioned lifestyle .
another factor is the large number of migrant workers who carry the virus across the country .
there are free con@@ doms on every corner , said Annette Lenn@@ art@@ z , &quot; but they are hardly used .
the culture prescri@@ bes otherwise - flesh to flesh . &quot;
in order to promote the cultural exchange , the im@@ bon@@ gi choir travels through Southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs of melanch@@ oly , fighting spirit , confidence and black self @-@ esteem , which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid .
a bus full of white people , who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only mor@@ ale and joy , but some grim @-@ faced border soldiers even shed a few tears .
the journey always leads to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , where the singers visit their sponsor children .
even though you can barely find the small village on a map , it is more than well @-@ known in the valley of the E@@ zul@@ wen@@ i River .
&quot; go to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , that &apos;s where the light is , &quot; say the people there .
and if you make the 8,@@ 7@@ 33 @-@ kilometre flight back to Heidelberg , to visit the st@@ omp@@ ing singers in their rehear@@ sal room , you &apos;ll see that the light is there too .
Messenger : NASA discovers ice on Mercury
the Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury .
it is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick .
the US space agency , NASA , has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury .
although the planet lies closest to the sun , it does have frozen water - as shown in three studies published on Thursday in specialist magazine &quot; Science . &quot;
the Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies permanently in shadow .
this is thought to be at east 30 cen@@ timet@@ res and perhaps up to 20 metres thick .
the water presumably came from com@@ ets or perhaps also astero@@ ids that impacted with Mercury .
however , no @-@ one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet , said Chief Scienti@@ st for the Messenger probe , Sean Solomon .
the temperature on Mercury can reach up to 4@@ 26 degrees Celsius .
that said , the findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other regions of the solar system .
unknown to the majority of the Earth &apos;s inhabitants , there are probes , telescop@@ es and small robots such as the Phoenix , deployed to research the depths of the universe .
from time to time , they transmit images to Earth : small pe@@ ep@@ holes into the infinite expanse .
this image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute .
the eight planets of our solar system , plus the dwarf planet Cer@@ es .
like Pluto , which or@@ bits around the sun behind Nept@@ une , Cer@@ es is not a planet according to the new definition of the term issued by the International Astronom@@ ical Union in 2006 .
this image section from an infrared recording by the Spit@@ zer telescope shows a &quot; family portrait &quot; of countless generations of stars : the oldest stars are seen as blue dots , while more difficult to identify are the pink @-@ coloured &quot; new @-@ bor@@ ns &quot; in the star delivery room .
this star @-@ forming region - rather un@@ roman@@ tically named W@@ 5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spit@@ zer telescope in the Cassi@@ op@@ eia constellation , at a distance of 6,@@ 500 light years away .
this sh@@ immer@@ ing glow of a dying star was captured by NASA &apos;s Spit@@ zer telescope .
the don@@ ut @-@ shaped ring consists of material , ej@@ ected by the star in the process of dying .
in the huge Tri@@ fi@@ d Neb@@ ula , 5,@@ 400 light years away from the Earth , new stars are created from gas and dust .
NASA &apos;s Spit@@ zer telescope shot this photo of the gal@@ actic delivery room .
the P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster , also referred to as &quot; The Seven Sist@@ ers , &quot; can be seen with the bare eye at night .
with the telescope , however , the colours really come into their own .
in this infrared photo , the Hel@@ ix Neb@@ ula looks back at the observer like a red eye .
it is located 700 light years away in the Aqu@@ arius constellation .
its similarity with the continent resulted in this Neb@@ ula acquiring the title &apos; North America &apos; .
a combination of normal and infrared photography produced the spectacular colouring .
this baby star could only be captured in its full beauty using the Spit@@ zer telescope &apos;s infrared detectors .
Saturn and its rings : how these occurred is the greatest puzzle in the field of astronomy .
perhaps they are the remnants of a moon of Saturn , which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago .
one of the largest and shar@@ pest pictures from the Hubble telescope : the Whirlpool Galaxy
depending on the colouring , photographs of spiral galaxies can become genuine works of art .
the photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Tri@@ fi@@ d Neb@@ ula in the Sag@@ itt@@ arius constellation , several thousand light years away .
the name Tri@@ fi@@ d stems from the Latin word tri@@ fi@@ dus ( divided into three parts ) , as dark stripes of dust divide the core of the birthplace of stars into three parts .
in the Op@@ hi@@ uch@@ us constellation , astronomers have photographed the signs of a cosmic collision : 400 million light years from the earth , the cores of two merging galaxies move rapidly towards one another , destined to colli@@ de .
this star birth was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M@@ 83 spiral galaxy .
anyone who doesn &apos;t like technical abbrevi@@ ations may prefer to call it by its nickname , the Southern Catherine Wheel .
the photo taken by the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Iris Neb@@ ula in the C@@ ep@@ he@@ us constellation .
the nebul@@ a , 1,@@ 400 light years away , consists of particles of dust that are ten to one hundred times smaller than standard house dust .
this image was put together from the X @-@ ray images captured by various telescop@@ es .
it shows a ring of black holes , 430 million light years away from the Earth .
this group of galaxies , named Ar@@ p 273 , was pictured for NASA by the Hubble space telescope .
scientists call the larger spiral galaxy U@@ GC 1810 .
this star nebul@@ a is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way .
this &apos; star cradle &apos; continually produces new youngsters .
likewise , this star cloud , connected to the Ros@@ ette Neb@@ ula , continually produces new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the Earth .
in this bright shining galaxy with one small black hole , there exists no dust - only gas .
researchers presume that it only came into being shortly after the Big Bang , when the universe was comprised primarily of hydrogen .
our view of the universe : the most important telescop@@ es
the telescope is thought to have been invented in 16@@ 08 by Hans Lip@@ per@@ hey - even before Galileo Galilei used the device to observe the stars one year later .
since then , the mirrors in optical telescop@@ es have become increasingly large and the insights that they provide increasingly profound .
for a period of 30 years , namely from 1947 until 1975 , the H@@ ale telescope in the Pal@@ om@@ ar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world .
the mirror , shown in the image , had a diameter of five metres .
Arizona , USA , is home to the Large Bin@@ oc@@ ular Tel@@ escope .
it enables views of space via two mirrors , each with a diameter of 8.4 metres .
the inner workings of the Gran Tel@@ es@@ cop@@ io Canarias on the Canarian island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 metres .
the mirror of the Southern African Large Tel@@ escope in South Africa is seg@@ mented - to reduce costs .
in spite of this it achieves a diameter of around eleven metres .
the disadvantage of this inexpensive construction method : the telescope is securely cl@@ amped at its angle of inclination and its movement is therefore limited .
the Hobby Eber@@ ly telescope in Texas also has a fixed angle of inclination .
what sets it apart : the high light @-@ gathering capacity .
this - in spite of its comparatively low mirror diameter - even matches that of the world &apos;s largest refl@@ ector telescop@@ es .
with the help of a radio telescope in A@@ reci@@ bo ( Puerto Rico ) researchers can listen for extrater@@ restrial signals in space .
the radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres .
in the &quot; Search for Ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial Intelligence &quot; ( SET@@ I ) every computer owner can be of assistance , by making his / her processing capacity available .
view of the European Southern Observatory ( ES@@ O ) in the Chilean Andes .
this is home to the Very Large Tel@@ escope , which lives up to its name .
with its total of four mirrors , the telescope can also focus on the medi@@ al infrared spectrum .
likewise to be located at the ES@@ O Observatory in Chile , the European Extrem@@ ely Large Tel@@ escope is also being planned .
its main mirror is to span a full 42 metres and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements .
however , images are not to be expected until 2018 at the earliest .
until 2007 , the two K@@ eck telescop@@ es at the Hawai@@ ian volcano , Ma@@ una K@@ ea , were the largest in the world .
they each have two mirrors , each with a diameter of ten meters .
the K@@ eck telescop@@ es are part of the Ma@@ una K@@ ea Observatory , which alongside the K@@ eck telescop@@ es , can look to the heavens with the help of the Sub@@ aru telescope and the IR@@ TT@@ F .
another huge new telescope is also to be built on the Ma@@ una K@@ ea , with a mirror diameter of thirty metres .
here you can marvel at an artist &apos;s impression .
however , the most important insights into space are provided by the Hubble space telescope .
since 24 April 1990 it has been supplying images of distant worlds .
since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extra @-@ solar planets , especially for any that may be inhab@@ itable .
on 2 February 2011 it was announced by NASA that 1,@@ 235 planetary candidates had been identified since the mission began .
the image documents the final launch preparations on the Kepler space telescope .
the James Web@@ b Space Tel@@ escope ( J@@ W@@ ST ) will be launched into space on board an Ari@@ ane@@ 5 rocket by 2018 at the earliest .
the primary mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres .
one of the telescope &apos;s tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies that emerged after the Big Bang .
scientists are assuming that ice also exists at Mercury &apos;s south pole .
however , there is no reliable data in support of this as the Messenger or@@ bits around the planets much closer to the north pole .
for decades , radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury .
thanks to the Messenger probe that was launched in 2004 , the first to orbit Mercury , scientists can now be certain .
drink butter on a daily basis - and live to 168 years of age
in Southern Azerbaijan , many people reach biblical ages .
there is even a museum of longevity .
a hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still comparatively young .
in Southern Azerbaijan , many people reach ages that can almost be considered biblical .
there is even a museum of longevity .
a hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still comparatively young .
the journey through the T@@ aly@@ sh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic .
the minibus ru@@ mb@@ les over the winding streets , past densely wooded hills , raging rivers and simple farmhouses .
everywhere is green and lush - you could be forgiven for thinking you were in the Black Forest .
however , this is the deep south of Azerbaijan , and the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away .
this is the home of the Cauc@@ asian people group , the T@@ aly@@ sh , of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Persian and Azer@@ i and live long lives .
the final stop is L@@ eri@@ k .
the small town is bursting with over@@ power@@ ing architecture from Soviet times , which doesn &apos;t fit with the picturesque mountain landscape at all .
tourists from Europe rarely come here ; the journey from Azerbaijan &apos;s capital city , Baku , is too arduous .
it takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres , as too much of the route is just a single track .
the fabulous wealth , for which the country has its oil in the Caspian Sea to thank , has not yet arrives here in the province .
yet Pil@@ ata Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva ( 48 ) is convinced that L@@ eri@@ k has what it takes to be a tourist attraction .
&quot; Baku became famous in May due to the Euro@@ vision Song Contest , and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world , &quot; said Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
she is the Director of the Museum of Lon@@ ge@@ vity , most likely the only of its kind in the world .
here the lives of eight dozen T@@ aly@@ sh from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented . Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva points out a black &amp; white photo .
this here is my grandfather , he was 120 years old .
at the age of 136 he fa@@ thered another child .
however , the unrivalled star of the museum is shep@@ herd Shir@@ ali Musli@@ mov who is said to have lived to 168 years old .
however no birth certificate exists to confirm this .
and given that the longest confirmed lifespan was 122 years of age , Musli@@ mov &apos;s claim seems extremely doubtful .
&quot; he was born in 1805 , here in the region , and died in 1973 , &quot; explains Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
the man married three times and had 23 children , and is said to have fa@@ thered another daughter at the age of 136 .
so did Shir@@ ali Musli@@ mov mis@@ calculate his age by a couple of decades ?
but Rembrandt Sch@@ olz , researcher on ageing at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock , has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia .
&quot; a strik@@ ingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China , in Japan or the Hun@@ za Valley in Pakistan , &quot; said Sch@@ olz , &quot; while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in Sardinia . &quot;
due to lacking documentation , however , there is no scientific proof of age , particularly as there are no birth registers .
melted butter by the glass , every day
however , the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding L@@ eri@@ k reach a biblical age with striking regularity .
there are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age .
so why do so many very old people live here in the south ?
the Azer@@ i travel guide F@@ arid Mug@@ im@@ z@@ ade@@ h explains this as being due to the special T@@ aly@@ sh genetics .
in contrast , Museum Director Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva believes that it is due to diet .
however the notion that the cal@@ orie @-@ rich diet of the T@@ aly@@ sh , who love meat , bread and especially dairy products , and of whom many drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis , could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either .
or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young ? in Cen@@ gem@@ ir@@ an , a tiny settlement not far from the town of L@@ eri@@ k , lives Rub@@ aba Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
at 97 years old she is still comparatively young for the area .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , who claims to have 143 descendants , lives in a simple wooden house , which is typical of the entire Caucasus region .
she sits on the floor with a butter chur@@ n , which she rolls backwards and forwards tirelessly .
eight people live here under this roof , including one of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s sons and a daughter , both of whom have been grandparents for some time .
there are also two small children running around .
in the kitchen , tea is prepared for the guests , which is served in typical , bul@@ ging Arma@@ du glasses .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s white teeth stand in perfect rank and file , beneath her head@@ scarf she conceals long , dark bl@@ ond pla@@ its , which her son proudly reveals for us .
I have always washed my hair with milk , and it has never fallen out or lost its colour .
&quot; I have never used shampoo either , &quot; said Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
monthly pension is enough to live on
she has only ever eaten what she could get from her own farm - tomatoes , potatoes , pe@@ as .
my whole life I have never once bought gro@@ c@@ eries in the supermarket .
then she tells of her husband who was in the army .
things were at their worst during the time after the Second World War .
however , everything became better when the &quot; beloved father &quot; He@@ y@@ dar Ali@@ y@@ ev took the ru@@ dder .
the propaganda seems strange coming from the mouth of an old lady .
yet the cult that revol@@ ved around the father figure for the nation , who governed his country like a dictator practically knows no limits in Azerbaijan .
he held power until 2003 and his son Il@@ ham later took over the helm .
at least there is no deprivation among Azerbaijan &apos;s elderly .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva receives 230 Man@@ at ( around the same sum in euros ) per month as her pension , which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfortably .
and perhaps Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s long gre@@ ying son is right : &quot; the elderly enjoy a deep respect in our culture . &quot;
they live among their extended family , are loved , cared for and are happy .
if this is not a reason to live for as long as possible , then what is ?
the notion of &quot; human rights &quot; is omitted from the constitution .
the revolution has returned to Cairo .
competing demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division within the country .
the future constitution based on Sharia law is fiercely disputed .
the Egyptian President is not holding back his emotion .
we must make the transition .
&quot; and making sure it succeeds is my responsibility , before the people and before God , &quot; he said on state television .
his speech was aimed at the entire population , however in particular at the Cop@@ tic Christians , the liberals , enlightened Muslims and secular@@ ists .
for all of them , until now hop@@ elessly est@@ ranged in a bewil@@ dered opposition , are fearful .
they are fearful of a God State on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood .
according to Mohamed Mur@@ si , speaking almost apo@@ lo@@ ge@@ tically , he has temporarily restricted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority , &quot; in order to rescue the revolution . &quot;
however , Egyptians - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 61 @-@ year @-@ old engineer who holds a Doc@@ torate from the American University of Southern California , really wants to save .
should the judiciary be deprived of power ?
in actual fact , the 234 articles , which have been pushed through by the Islamic @-@ dominated 110 @-@ person Constitu@@ ent Assembly , are in some aspects cause for concern .
as was also the case under previous constitutions , under the draft ju@@ dic@@ ature is justified on the &quot; principles of Islamic law . &quot;
yet what are &quot; principles &quot; ?
this was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islamists will make use of the wo@@ olly formulation and the resulting room for legal manoeuvre in favour of a stricter interpretation of Sharia law .
this is at least suggested by one newly added article : in all issues affecting Sharia law , the Al Ash@@ ar University must be consulted , the country &apos;s most important Islamic institution , which has great influence throughout the whole of Sunni Islam .
this can , but does not necessarily have to mean that the clergy will oversee legislation , which would result in the de facto incap@@ ac@@ itation of the judiciary .
much in the constitutional draft is open to interpretation
also problematic : civil military jurisdiction will continue to be upheld .
during Mubarak &apos;s rule , these courts served to suppress opposition .
following the fall of the dictator , up to 11@@ ,000 civilians were under military imprisonment .
according to the draft , the state should also protect &quot; the true character of the Egyptian family , and promote its morals and values . &quot;
from a legal perspective , this is formulated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cinematic art and literature .
in plain language , this is nothing other than censorship .
incidentally , no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and women .
another does prohibit the insult or s@@ lander of the prophet Mohamed and his em@@ iss@@ aries .
however , what constitutes an insult and how this should be sanctioned remains unclear .
equally dubious is the formulation stating that &quot; insulting people &quot; is forbidden .
is a caric@@ ature of the president sufficient , or a joke at the expense of a jur@@ ist ?
open to interpretation , like so much in the draft submitted by Mur@@ si to be signed and that , in his own words , will be submitted to Egyptians for referendum &quot; very soon . &quot;
&quot; the revolution is back &quot;
for weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islamists .
tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the Tah@@ rir Square in Cairo , in unfamiliar unity , and pledged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect .
&quot; the revolution is back and we are going to be victorious , &quot; said Ham@@ din Sab@@ bah@@ i , third place candidate in the presidential elections .
noble Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Authority , Mohamed El @-@ Bar@@ ad@@ ei explained that the constitutional draft belongs &quot; on the rubbish tip of history . &quot;
via SMS service Twitter , he accused Mur@@ si &apos;s followers of wanting to lead &quot; a coup against democracy . &quot;
&quot; if he calls for the referendum , we will go to his palace and overthrow him , &quot; said member of the opposition J@@ asser Said .
&quot; we have not yet grown tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet been at@@ oned for , &quot; stated the Egyptian media , quoting opposition politician Chal@@ ed Ali .
and several judges have signalled that they do not want to oversee the referendum , which would render it invalid .
&quot; the Koran is our constitution &quot;
the well @-@ organised Muslim Brotherhood gathered for a counter @-@ demonstration , although acting cautiously they did not choose the Tah@@ rir Square but rather a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile , outside the Cairo University .
many veiled women and followers of the Sal@@ af@@ is took part , shouting out : &quot; the people demand the application of God &apos;s law . &quot;
they demanded of Mur@@ si : &quot; clean@@ se the country ! &quot; and protested : &quot; the Koran is our constitution . &quot;
a struggle for control over the symbolic Tah@@ rir Square , where everything began , would have most likely provoked events ver@@ ging on civil war .
quite clearly , this was something that Mur@@ si &apos;s followers did not want to risk .
the Muslim Brothers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear .
now is the time to let the population decide at the ballot box , in which direction the country should move forward .
it is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islamists &apos; draft .
&quot; the term &apos; human rights &apos; does not even appear once &quot;
Haf@@ ez Abu Sa@@ eda is furious about this forced constitu@@ tive process , which actually should have lasted until February and should have involved all social interest groups .
the 48 @-@ year @-@ old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights ( E@@ O@@ HR ) defended the Muslim Brotherhood , when imprisoned or in court under Mubarak .
not because he shared their world view , but because for him , human rights are indivisible .
for this he was batter@@ ed , condemned and imprisoned .
&quot; and now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution , &quot; he b@@ emo@@ aned in a discussion with &quot; Welt am Sonntag . &quot;
the lawyer has resigned himself to Mur@@ si extending his power to all three branches of state government .
these measures are blatant breaches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dictatorship .
&quot; instead of strengthening the civil society , the President is effectively suspending it , &quot; complained Sa@@ eda .
yet without civil society organisations , a democracy cannot function .
Sa@@ eda feels abandoned , even by the international community , which is observing the battle over the ideological direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement .
this could come back to ha@@ unt them .
one demonstr@@ ator at the Tah@@ rir warned : &quot; you are letting loose a monster that you can no longer control . &quot;
Norway &apos;s rak@@ fis@@ k : is this the world &apos;s sm@@ el@@ liest fish ?
Norway &apos;s five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in Europe , but in the world .
could the secret of the country &apos;s success be connected to the local appetite for some exceedingly sm@@ elly fish ?
take a selection of over @-@ ripe cheeses .
place them in the midst of a pile of dirty , wet soccer kit .
leave for a week .
now you have the nose @-@ num@@ bing smell of rak@@ fis@@ k , one of the great Norwegian delicacies .
I am in the small town of Fag@@ ern@@ es , about three hours from Oslo .
there is snow , spectacular scenery - and that od@@ our , ever present , hangs in the air .
rak@@ fis@@ k is trout sprin@@ kled with salt and fermented in water for - depending on how sm@@ elly you like your fish - up to a year .
as the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , Norweg@@ ians flock to a festival here in Fag@@ ern@@ es devoted to this most , well , captivating of foods .
&quot; you eat it raw , and then swallow a glass of aqu@@ av@@ it , &quot; says Hav@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen , full @-@ time local fi@@ ref@@ ighter but also the so @-@ called &quot; Rak@@ fis@@ k General , &quot; in charge of running the festival .
all around us people are eating little cubes of the fish and knocking back quantities of drink .
&quot; some people like the aqu@@ av@@ it more than the rak@@ fis@@ k , &quot; says Hav@@ ard .
the drink can kill the smell .
I try a few pieces .
if you can avoid passing it under your nose , it is not bad - not unlike a slice of sus@@ hi that has been on rather a long bus journey .
rak@@ fis@@ k is a product of very different , poverty @-@ stricken times in Norway when , pre @-@ refrigeration , fish was so@@ aked in air@@ tight barrels of water and salt in autumn .
then in the depths of winter , well and truly fermented , it is taken out and - no doubt with the senses knocked out by alcohol - eaten .
only a generation ago , thousands of Norweg@@ ians were forced to leave their country in search of work , emig@@ rating mainly to the US .
now the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by plentiful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system .
people from Sweden , the old rival and not so long ago far richer than Norway , stream in to work .
rak@@ fis@@ k is seen as signi@@ fying something important , a vital if rather sm@@ elly part of Norway &apos;s past .
it is among the more expensive dishes you can buy .
but then everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich knock you back £ 9 ( $ 14 ) each .
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way .
people here are still lo@@ ath to mention by name Anders Brei@@ vik , the right @-@ wing , racist extremist who gun@@ ned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year .
instead , the sho@@ otings are referred to as &quot; the July the 22nd incident . &quot;
Norweg@@ ians find it very difficult to believe that in their peace @-@ loving country one of their own was capable of such brutality and murder .
the growth since the early 1970s of one of the world &apos;s biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway &apos;s present @-@ day wealth .
&quot; but oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , &quot; says Anna our wait@@ ress , handing round trays of mat@@ uring rak@@ fis@@ k and , with her long bl@@ ond hair and start@@ l@@ ingly blue eyes , the image of Nordic well @-@ being .
we are a - how you say - prudent people .
her English , like that of most people here , is flawless .
we are not very show@@ y , we do not like ost@@ entation .
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations .
when everyone else was throwing around money they did not have , in the years leading up to the global financial crash , Norway kept its purse strings tightly bound .
&quot; as long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer we are happy , &quot; says Anna .
&quot; and eat rak@@ fis@@ k , &quot; she adds with a carefree laugh .
I stand in the snow and queue for something to eat - I have had enough rak@@ fis@@ k .
now an el@@ k burger is certainly something different and rather suc@@ cul@@ ent to the taste .
but in the evening , it is more of that sm@@ elly fish .
the hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a rak@@ fis@@ k dinner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nas@@ ally challenging - fish .
there is a live TV link up to a comp@@ ere in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rak@@ fis@@ k .
it is like the Euro@@ vision song contest .
&quot; what score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains Th@@ or @-@ Ju@@ er@@ gen ? &quot;
&quot; here are our points , Hav@@ ard . &quot;
there is cl@@ apping , laughter .
a man falls off his chair , perhaps overcome with aqu@@ av@@ it .
or maybe it is the f@@ umes from all that fish .
Mexico &apos;s Enrique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to faces tough start
as Mexico &apos;s incoming President Enrique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to prepares to take office , the BBC &apos;s Will Grant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population .
traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present .
a con@@ gested city at the best of times , a ring of steel has been erected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads .
the aim , however , wasn &apos;t to stop comm@@ u@@ ters getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament .
on Saturday , Mexico &apos;s new president Enrique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to will receive the presidential s@@ ash and take over the running of the nation .
he faces a complicated task .
Mexico has been performing well economically under the outgoing administration of Felipe Calder@@ on , but the country is in the grip of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years .
&quot; my government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence , &quot; Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to told US President Barack Obama in the O@@ val Office earlier this week .
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim .
before rubbing shoulders with the US president , Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to &apos;s previous political experience was as governor of his home state , the State of Mexico .
a populous , spraw@@ ling state surrounding the capital , opinions about the new leader are divided in his old st@@ omp@@ ing ground .
a straightforward man
in the bu@@ co@@ lic town of Valle del Bravo , for example , he is remembered fond@@ ly .
residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure .
to reach the town you can drive along one of Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to &apos;s new motorways , a vast improvement on the cra@@ cked and bum@@ py roads it replaced .
pla@@ ques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change .
&quot; we are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , &quot; says friend and political ally Gabriel Ol@@ vera Her@@ nan@@ dez , a state congres@@ sman for Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to &apos;s party , the PRI .
particularly in terms of security and the economy , we &apos;re hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs .
after an un@@ broken 81 years in power , the PRI was ou@@ sted in 2000 by Vicente Fox .
Congres@@ sman Ol@@ vera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pin@@ os , there is much expectation within the party about Enrique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to .
and he rejects the opposition &apos;s character@@ isation of the new president as lacking substance .
he &apos;s a very straightforward man , very committed with an excellent vision of the country .
he &apos;s an excellent states@@ man and , above all , he &apos;s someone who knows how to listen .
but on the other side of the state , that is not the impression many people have of their former governor .
in Ne@@ zah@@ u@@ alco@@ y@@ ot@@ l , also known as Ciudad ne@@ za , the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo couldn &apos;t be shar@@ per .
tucked away under motorway fly@@ overs , it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself .
and the problems in the municipality are also gr@@ itty and urban .
earlier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods , and violence against women is particularly acute .
on a patch of wast@@ eland by a vast landfill site , the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone .
more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to was governor , a rate much higher than in the notori@@ ously violent city of Ciudad Ju@@ arez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women .
Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to &apos;s critics say , at best , he failed to adequately address the problem of fem@@ icide while he was in office .
at worst , they accuse his administration of turning a blind eye .
in a concrete home typical of the rund@@ own neighbourhood , I@@ rin@@ ea Bu@@ en@@ dia struggles to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter , Mari@@ ana Luna .
according to the official version of events , Mari@@ ana committed suicide in 2010 .
however her family believes she was murdered by her partner .
&quot; when I arrived at her house it seemed her body had been washed , &quot; S@@ enor@@ a Bu@@ en@@ dia recalls .
there were signs she &apos;d been beaten , and rig@@ or mor@@ tis had already set in .
as her mother re@@ counts the story , a picture of Mari@@ ana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a single word : justice .
however , that is exactly what the family say they have been denied .
the state authorities have treated me like I &apos;m an old go@@ ssip , a trouble @-@ maker , a wh@@ iner .
what they want is that one simply accepts what they say and sh@@ uts up .
&quot; but that can &apos;t be right when there were so many irregularities and omissions , &quot; she says .
as President P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to receives the s@@ ash on Saturday , it comes with a heavy responsibility .
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office .
&quot; I hope he &apos;s the same kind of president as he was a governor , &quot; says PRI Congres@@ sman Ol@@ vera in Valle del Bravo .
that , however , is exactly what victims &apos; families in Ciudad ne@@ za most fear .
Brad@@ ley Mann@@ ing didn &apos;t complain about mistre@@ atment , prosecutors contend
prosecutors try to counter Brad@@ ley Mann@@ ing &apos;s claims of abuse in confinement
the hearing focuses on Mann@@ ing &apos;s time in the military bri@@ g at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Virginia
defense wants case dismissed on grounds that Mann@@ ing &apos;s confinement was harsh
the Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents
prosecutors tried to establish Friday that Army private Brad@@ ley Mann@@ ing -- charged in the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mistre@@ atment he &apos;s alleg@@ ing he suffered in military custody .
while cross @-@ examining Mann@@ ing at a pre @-@ trial hearing at F@@ t . Me@@ ade , Maryland , prosecutor Maj@@ . Ash@@ den F@@ ein asserted that records of weekly visits Mann@@ ing had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Virginia , show no complaints about his treatment .
the cross @-@ examination -- during a hearing on a defense motion to have Mann@@ ing &apos;s case dismissed on grounds that his confinement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment -- came a day after Mann@@ ing testified that he had considered suicide while in custody .
the Army intelligence analyst , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq .
the material was then published online by WikiLeaks .
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Mann@@ ing was the source of its information .
in Friday &apos;s hearing , F@@ ein reviewed with Mann@@ ing the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Mann@@ ing during his detention at Qu@@ an@@ tico &apos;s bri@@ g , where he was held under a heightened confinement status from July 2010 to April 2011 .
officers would ask Mann@@ ing questions and write down his responses .
when F@@ ein asked about the forms Friday , Mann@@ ing acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as &quot; excellent &quot; and treatment by the facility overall as &quot; very professional . &quot;
the forms show no complaints of mistre@@ atment , even though the officers asked Mann@@ ing directly about his treatment , F@@ ein conten@@ ded .
man@@ ning responded that he would verb@@ ally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they didn &apos;t record the issues .
&quot; they would write down &apos; no issues &apos; ( after discussing the concerns ) , and it didn &apos;t necessarily mean I didn &apos;t bring something up , &quot; Mann@@ ing said .
the judge , Army Col@@ . Den@@ ise Lin@@ d , also asked Mann@@ ing why he didn &apos;t complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suici@@ dal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier .
man@@ ning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get his &quot; prevention of injury &quot; status down@@ graded .
the military said they put him on this restrictive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others .
&quot; I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the PO@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my viewpoint , &quot; Mann@@ ing said .
man@@ ning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait , where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the bri@@ g at Marine Base Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia in July 2010 .
he said he contemplated suicide in Kuwait and once passed out there due to the heat .
he said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was distressing .
&quot; my world just shrink to Camp Ara@@ fj@@ on , to that cage , &quot; Mann@@ ing said Thursday .
I thought I was going to die in that cage .
once at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Mann@@ ing said , he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company .
man@@ ning said he was allowed only a mattress , blanket , flip @-@ fl@@ ops , some clothes and his glasses .
he said he tried to keep moving , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules .
man@@ ning said he always slept with light from outside his cell in his eyes .
if guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night , he said they would wake him to roll back over .
man@@ ning &apos;s lawyer filed a formal objection to Mann@@ ing &apos;s treatment in January 2011 .
man@@ ning was moved to the military prison at Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , Kansas , in April 2011 .
also Friday , the judge asked Mann@@ ing about an alleg@@ ation that he made in Thursday &apos;s testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Qu@@ an@@ tico cell , he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning head count .
man@@ ning had testified that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blanket during the head count .
under questioning from the judge Friday , Mann@@ ing said that he infer@@ red from his guard &apos;s order that he should drop a blanket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it .
man@@ ning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he wasn &apos;t a danger to himself .
man@@ ning said that he told the officer that he could have used the wa@@ ist@@ band of his underwear or his flip @-@ fl@@ ops to hurt himself but hadn &apos;t done so .
that night , Mann@@ ing testified , his underwear , flip @-@ fl@@ ops and glasses were removed from his cell .
his lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during confinement into account and sharply reduce his sentence should he be convicted at his court @-@ martial , which is expected to begin early next year .
the defense has said it plans to have Mann@@ ing plead guilty to lesser off@@ enses and fight other charges as being too extreme .
the hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend , with prosecutors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warranted .
the Pentagon has maintained that Mann@@ ing was held in accordance with rules governing all maximum @-@ custody detainees at Qu@@ an@@ tico .
counts against Mann@@ ing include aiding the enemy , wrong@@ fully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet , transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or records .
if he &apos;s convicted on all counts , he could face a life sentence .
my Mexican @-@ American identity crisis
he says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there
Mex@@ icans tend to fault those who left ; they remind Mex@@ icans of hard times , he says
Navar@@ rette says Mexican @-@ Americans are caught between two worlds
on a recent trip to Mexico City , I had barely made my way down the con@@ course and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got stum@@ ped .
signs pointed the way to two lines : one for &quot; mex@@ ic@@ anos &quot; ( &quot; Mex@@ icans &quot; ) , another for &quot; extran@@ jer@@ os &quot; ( &quot; For@@ eign@@ ers . &quot; )
I stood there for a few seconds , unsure of where to go .
growing up in Central California , I had been called a &quot; Mexican &quot; my entire life .
it &apos;s ethnic shor@@ th@@ and in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as &quot; Irish &quot; or my friends in New York describe themselves as &quot; Italian . &quot;
later , I settled on &quot; Mexican @-@ American . &quot;
but , this was Mexico .
and , in the homeland of my grandfather , there was no need for shor@@ th@@ and or hy@@ ph@@ ens .
I was simply an American .
I speak Spanish , good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language .
but I don &apos;t have the vocabulary of a native , and I can &apos;t shake my American accent .
so I took my U.S. passport and got in the line for extran@@ jer@@ os .
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican president @-@ elect Enrique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
on the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade .
pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy , which is one reason that Mex@@ icans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States .
he wants to partner with the United States and Canada , and create a European Union @-@ style trading bloc in North America .
and P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to v@@ owed to continue Mexico &apos;s war against the drug cartels , even though he offered no specifics .
for Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings .
most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 1848 , the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rifle .
but for Mex@@ icans , who think in terms of centuries , not minutes , the reminders are everywhere .
so the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico , you start hearing -- in the Mexican press , and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are encro@@ aching upon their neighbor &apos;s sovereignty .
and the children of Monte@@ zu@@ ma go on the war@@ path .
and yet , for Mexico , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican @-@ Americans living in the United States .
you want to talk about hard feelings ?
there is plenty .
Mexico has winners and losers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn &apos;t .
the only reason you have so many people of Mexican ancest@@ ry living in cities like Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Phoenix , Denver or San Antonio is because , at some point in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a parent or grand@@ parent , who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north .
and more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dark skin , little education , from a poor village , etc .
we &apos;re their offspring , and we &apos;re loyal to them .
not Mexico .
and even though we may now be living the American Dream , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it &apos;s the American Dream we &apos;re living , and not the Mexican one .
our identity might sometimes be fu@@ zzy , but our loyalty is clear .
it &apos;s to the United States .
besides , we &apos;re aware that many of the elite Mex@@ icans in the ruling class don &apos;t like us .
the feeling is mutual .
they see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as inferior stock that isn &apos;t sufficiently Mexican .
our Spanish will never be good enough , our ties to Mexico never strong enough .
our existence is , as they see it , all about failure .
if our families hadn &apos;t failed in Mexico , they wouldn &apos;t have left .
and we wouldn &apos;t now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain , living well in the United States but lost souls nonetheless .
my wife , who was born in Guadal@@ ajara and came to the United States legally as a child , reminds me that there is friction between Mex@@ icans and Mexican @-@ Americans because Mex@@ icans have a firmer grasp of who they are and Mexican @-@ Americans res@@ ent that .
while she &apos;s a U.S. citizen , she sees herself as a part of two countries .
meanwhile , many Mexican @-@ Americans I know don &apos;t feel like they &apos;re a part of either .
we love listening to the Mexican band , Los Tig@@ res del Norte , but also to Bruce Springsteen .
you get the best of both worlds , but you &apos;re rooted in neither .
in Mexico , we &apos;re seen as Americans .
and in the United States , we &apos;re considered Mexican .
now , to complicate the relationship even further , as I learned during my trip , some Mexican leaders and parts of the intelligent@@ sia want to re@@ connect with the Diaspora .
they want to put Mexican @-@ Americans to work as ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft &quot; ambassadors &quot; for Mexico , representing its interest in the United States .
we would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico .
yeah .
that &apos;s not going to happen .
too many hard feelings .
and , with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country .
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re on your own , am@@ igos .
that &apos;s fair .
if at least some Mex@@ icans aren &apos;t yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican @-@ Americans still hold a gru@@ dge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that .
hmm@@ m .
maybe we &apos;re more &quot; Mexican &quot; than I thought .
old battles , new Middle East
the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East ?
another round of bloodshed suggests that any such hope is vain .
amid the usual futile arguments over who started it , scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble ; more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed ; and , for the first time , missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv , Israel &apos;s metropolis , and the holy city of Jerusalem .
but though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict , all around them the Middle East is changing .
the Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air , and , like it or not , the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional turmoil .
maybe this will make their struggle bloo@@ dier than before .
however , there are reasons for thinking it could just break their lethal stalemate .
a war that is neither lost or won
at first sight , optimism looks very hard to justify now .
even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st holds , this week &apos;s fighting has strengthened the haw@@ ks on both sides .
the leaders of Hamas , the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off , even though Gaza has taken a dru@@ b@@ bing .
despite killing some of its leaders and bot@@ tling up Gaza &apos;s 1.@@ 7@@ m people in one of the most wretched and crowded corners of the planet , Israel has failed to destroy Hamas .
indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah , the more moderate Palestinian faction .
moreover , Hamas &apos;s leaders may well conclude that time is on their side .
as Islamists across the Arab world have gained clout , so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends .
Turkey , a res@@ urgent regional power that was once Israel &apos;s closest Muslim ally , has taken up Hamas &apos;s cause ; so has Qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic of the Gulf states .
jubil@@ ant Hamas people say an Islamist c@@ res@@ cent is cur@@ ving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the Hiz@@ bul@@ lah party @-@ cum @-@ militia holds sway , through Syria , where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent may t@@ opp@@ le Bashar Assad , and on down through Jordan , where Hamas &apos;s allies are men@@ ac@@ ing the king .
above all , on Israel &apos;s southern flan@@ k , the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt , by far the most populous and pivotal of Arab countries , has changed the region &apos;s balance .
Hosni Mubarak , the secular des@@ pot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his down@@ fall in 2011 , had little time for Hamas .
by contrast , the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas , and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion .
in future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America .
meanwhile , Israel &apos;s hard@@ liners will draw the opposite conclusions .
in military terms , Hamas has been put back in its box .
Israel &apos;s Iron Dome anti @-@ missile system has proved its worth and many of Hamas &apos;s missiles have been destroyed .
Israelis will sleep more sound@@ ly - for a while .
in diplomatic terms , America is as stead@@ fast as ever ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence .
above all , Israel has prosp@@ ered , especially under Bin@@ y@@ amin Netanyahu , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has been fairly free of suicide @-@ bombers , thanks in part to the barrier that bit@@ es into the West Bank , the main ch@@ unk of a would @-@ be Palestinian state , and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illeg@@ ality in international law .
Mr Netanyahu , whose Likud party has merged with an even more haw@@ k@@ ish lot under Avi@@ g@@ dor Lie@@ ber@@ man in the run @-@ up to an election on January 22nd , is sitting pretty .
why co@@ ddle those twi@@ sty Palestinians by giving them a state of their own ?
if they really ran the West Bank , would they not fire rockets , just as their compatriots have done in Gaza ?
better to keep them behind that wall and sm@@ ite them if they raise their heads .
maybe the hard@@ liners will win out ; yet the Arab spring may change their calculations .
even if the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home .
Israel &apos;s defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined .
starting a war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments mend their economies .
that the pragmatic Mr Morsi worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire aug@@ urs well - and might just mark the start of something .
Israelis too should look to the longer term .
with the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depriving Palestinians of their right to self @-@ determination is creating a powder ke@@ g that is bound one day to explode in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week .
repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and demo@@ graphy exacerb@@ ates this as the Arab population sw@@ ells .
bloody missions against Gaza every few years to knock back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic toll .
both sides need pro@@ dding by outsiders
the answer remains the one trump@@ eted by sensible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with Israel c@@ eding territory for security .
the hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsiders pushing that cause .
Egypt , which must now set about stopping the flow of arms into Gaza , along with Turkey and Qatar , is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem .
Arab outsiders should also press Hamas and Fatah to come together .
that would do more to create a Palestinian state than the imminent bid for virtual statehood at the UN .
Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table .
during his first term , he neglected to present his own plan for peace .
back in the White House , he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in .
this is wo@@ efully short @-@ sighted .
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East .
that means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians .
cigarette plain packaging laws come into force in Australia
smoking warnings and diseas@@ ed body parts emb@@ la@@ z@@ oned on dull green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia &apos;s world @-@ first laws on cigarette and tobacco plain packaging have come into force , replacing brand logos and colours with generic dr@@ ab olive green coverings , gru@@ esome pictures of diseas@@ ed body parts and depic@@ tions of children and babies made ill by their parents &apos; smoking .
apart from the varying health warnings and images the only difference between the packs , mandatory from Saturday , are the brand names , and these are all printed in identical small font .
it is the world &apos;s most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco .
Australia &apos;s federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by stripping the habit of glamour .
it is relying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up .
&quot; even from a very early age you can see that kids understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their branding , &quot; said the federal health minister , T@@ anya P@@ liber@@ sek , citing studies that showed , for example , children linking a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess .
while Australia has one of the world &apos;s lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on multinationals &apos; profits , other countries are considering similar steps .
the tobacco industry lob@@ bi@@ ed hard against the laws .
tobacco firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to cheaper , more accessible cigarettes .
&quot; there will be serious unintended consequences from the legislation , &quot; said Scott Mc@@ Int@@ y@@ re of British American Tobacco Australia .
counterfei@@ ters from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia .
others say the laws have boosted their business .
Sandra Ha of Z@@ ico Import P@@ ty Ltd , a small family business , said demand for cigarette cases , silicon covers to mask the un@@ pal@@ atable packages , had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tobacco , Britain &apos;s Imperial Tobacco , Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the laws in Australia &apos;s high court .
ha said Z@@ ico had sold up to 6,000 to wholesale outlets and was awaiting new stock .
this is good business for us .
the potential hit@@ ch , experts say , is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targeting .
after a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online .
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas sites .
&quot; if you are a tobacco mark@@ eter and you &apos;ve only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the compelling place for you to be in , &quot; said Beck@@ y Fre@@ eman , a public health researcher at Sydney University .
Fre@@ eman noted an increase in &quot; average Joe &quot; reviews of brands on social media sites such as YouTube , Twitter and Facebook .
we have to ask , is that just a private citizen who really loves Marl@@ bor@@ o cigarettes and they &apos;ve gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing .
the industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine , Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being unfairly restricted , despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia .
a WTO ruling is likely in mid @-@ 2013 .
P@@ liber@@ sek said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging .
Canada was the first country to make photograph warnings mandatory in 2001 .
they now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
tougher laws are being considered in Britain , New Zealand , South Africa and India .
many smokers in Australia remain defi@@ ant .
the pictures don &apos;t affect me .
I just ignore them .
&quot; you just grab a smoke and put it away , &quot; said Victor El H@@ age as he purchased a pack with a photograph of a mouth tum@@ our .
honestly , there &apos;s only one reason I &apos;d stop , and that &apos;s my little girl .
James Yu , who runs the King of the Pack tob@@ ac@@ con@@ ist in central Sydney , said the uniform packaging made it harder to stack his shelves
&quot; it used to take me an hour to un@@ load a delivery , now it takes me four hours , &quot; Yu said .
&quot; the government should have just banned them altogether and then we &apos;d go OK , fine , we &apos;re done , we &apos;ll shut up shop , &quot; he said , throwing his hands up in the air .
in a Const@@ antly Plu@@ gged @-@ In World , It &apos;s Not All Bad to Be B@@ ored
I spent five unexpected hours in an airport this Than@@ ks@@ giving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive .
so I had plenty of time to think about the subject of bor@@ edom .
I won &apos;t lie to you .
half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty tedious , even with the distra@@ ctions of books , magazines and i@@ Phones ( not to mention duty @-@ free shopping ) .
but increasingly , some academics and child development experts are coming out in praise of bor@@ edom .
it &apos;s all right for us - and our children - to be bored on occasion , they say .
it forces the brain to go on interesting tang@@ ents , perhaps fostering creativity .
and because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another these days , we don &apos;t experience the benefits of bor@@ edom .
so should we embrace bor@@ edom ?
yes .
and no .
but I &apos;ll get back to that .
first of all , like many people , I assumed that bor@@ edom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the advent of more leisure time .
not so , says Peter T@@ oo@@ hey , a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of &quot; bor@@ edom : a Li@@ vely History &quot; ( Yale University Press , 2011 ) .
&quot; bor@@ edom actually has a very long history , &quot; he said .
there &apos;s Latin graffiti about bor@@ edom on the walls of Pomp@@ ei@@ i dating from the first century .
then there &apos;s the question of how we define bor@@ edom .
the trouble is that it has been defined , and discussed , in many different ways , said John D. East@@ wood , an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario , Canada .
after looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor East@@ wood and his colleagues defined bor@@ edom as an experience of &quot; wanting to , but being unable to engage in satisfying activity . &quot;
what separates bor@@ edom from apathy , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be .
with apathy , he said , there is no urge to do something .
the core experience of bor@@ edom , he said , is &quot; disruption of the attention process , associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . &quot;
bor@@ edom can sound an awful lot like depression .
but Professor East@@ wood said that while they can be related , people who are bored tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves .
sometimes we think we &apos;re bored when we just have difficulty concentrating .
in their study , &quot; The un@@ engaged Mind : defining bor@@ edom in Terms of At@@ tention , &quot; which appeared in the journal Per@@ spectives on Psych@@ ological Science in September , Professor East@@ wood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article .
some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was barely noticeable , while the third group didn &apos;t hear the soundtrack at all .
the ones who heard the low @-@ level TV reported more bor@@ edom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why , and attributed that difficulty to bor@@ edom .
when you &apos;re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task , disruption of attention can lead to bor@@ edom , said Mark J. F@@ ens@@ ke , an associate professor of neur@@ osci@@ ence at the University of Gu@@ el@@ ph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study .
on the other hand , when you &apos;re doing something dull , &quot; such as looking for bad widgets on a factory line , distra@@ c@@ ting music can help you not be bored . &quot;
in fact , he said , we now know that squir@@ ming and d@@ ood@@ ling , often seen as a sign of bor@@ edom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physically alert .
&quot; research shows that kids who are allowed to fi@@ d@@ get learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still , &quot; Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
we all experience bor@@ edom at some points - my flight delay , a d@@ ron@@ ing speaker , a particularly tedious movie .
but some individuals are more likely to be bored than others .
to help measure this , researchers developed a &quot; bor@@ edom pron@@ eness Scale &quot; in the 1980s .
the scale includes questions like , &quot; Many things I have to do are repetitive and monot@@ on@@ ous , &quot; and &quot; I have so many interests , I don &apos;t have time to do everything . &quot;
using such scales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls , said Stephen Vo@@ dan@@ ovich , a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida , especially when it comes needing more , and a variety of , external stimulation .
but in general , teenagers are a pretty j@@ aded lot .
in 1991 , Reed Lar@@ son , a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois , conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by be@@ eper .
he found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in school and doing homework , while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren &apos;t in school .
on the other hand , 3 percent of parents said they were bored .
Professor Lar@@ son said he did not know whether the bor@@ edom percentages now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
but he said he did know that &quot; adolesc@@ ence is a peak period for bor@@ edom , &quot; largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
so back to my original question : is bor@@ edom good for you ?
sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks , gamble or indulge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows .
on the other hand , many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between bor@@ edom and creativity , said Professor Vo@@ dan@@ ovich , who has been studying the issue for more than two decades .
&quot; bor@@ edom is the brain &apos;s way to tell you you should be doing something else , &quot; said Gary Marcus , a professor of psychology at N.@@ Y@@ .@@ U.
but the brain doesn &apos;t always know the most appropriate thing to do .
if you &apos;re bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook , it will make you happy .
but if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term .
so if your child is bored and you give him an iPad , he may not be bored anymore , but he hasn &apos;t learned how to entertain himself , or self regulate , Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
and &quot; that self @-@ regulation transfers from one situation to other , &quot; he said .
your kid doesn &apos;t just learn to entertain himself , but gets more self @-@ control in other areas .
I don &apos;t think we really want to celebrate bor@@ edom .
nor should we be too critical of it .
rather , our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant chat@@ ter of activity and technology .
Professor East@@ wood agreed .
&quot; we frame it as we need to be bored more , but bor@@ edom is an agon@@ izing , res@@ tless desire to be connected with something meaningful , &quot; he said .
what people are really searching for , he said , is a way to un@@ plug and enjoy down time .
&quot; in an environment where we are constantly overs@@ tim@@ ulated , &quot; he said , &quot; it &apos;s hard to find ways to engage when the noise sh@@ uts down . &quot;
in Colorado , No play@@ book for New Mari@@ juana Law
Anthony Oro@@ zco , 19 , a community college student and soccer player in sou@@ theastern Colorado , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few nu@@ g@@ gets of mari@@ juana and a pipe he used to smoke it .
Mr. Oro@@ zco said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lam@@ ar , on the plains near the Kansas border , when they were pulled over .
after the police officer found mari@@ juana in the car , Mr. Oro@@ zco was issued a sum@@ mons for possession and drug parap@@ her@@ n@@ alia - petty off@@ enses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date .
&quot; we get treated like criminals , &quot; Mr. Oro@@ zco said .
but is he one ?
in the uncertain weeks after Colorado &apos;s vote to leg@@ alize small amounts of mari@@ juana for recreational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location .
hundreds of mis@@ de@@ mean@@ or mari@@ juana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure .
police departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small @-@ scale possession that will be legally sanctioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks .
but prosecutors in more conservative prec@@ inc@@ ts in Colorado have v@@ owed to press ahead with existing mari@@ juana cases and are still citing people for possession .
at the same time , several towns from the Denver suburbs to the Western mountains are voting to block new , state @-@ licensed retail mari@@ juana shops from opening in their communities .
&quot; this thing is evolving so quickly that I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen next , &quot; said Daniel J. O@@ ates , the police chief in Aurora , just east of Denver .
regulators in Washington State are also scrat@@ ching their heads .
and they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for production , manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of Dec@@ . 1 , 2013 .
they say that Colorado , for better or worse , is ahead of most states in regulating mari@@ juana , first for medical use and now recre@@ ation@@ ally .
&quot; Colorado has a more regulated market , so they will be a good guide , &quot; said Brian E. Smith , a spokesman for the Washington State Li@@ qu@@ or Control Board .
but no place or system , Mr. Smith conc@@ eded , can do more than suggest what might work .
&quot; there &apos;s no real precedent for us to follow , &quot; he said .
Washington &apos;s law , called I @-@ 50@@ 2 , takes effect on Dec@@ . 6 , which also leaves a year of lim@@ bo during which the state licensing system will not yet exist , but leg@@ alized possession will .
and there are thorny mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time , like how to balance the state &apos;s mandate of &quot; adequate access &quot; to licensed mari@@ juana with its prohibitions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of a school , park , playground or child care center .
&quot; nowhere will it be more difficult to site a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas , particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area , &quot; said Ben Living@@ ston , a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis , a recently formed research group .
on Nov@@ . 21 , Chief O@@ ates in Aurora sent his officers an e @-@ mail announcing that the city attorney would no longer be prosecuting small mari@@ juana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes &quot; effective immediately . &quot;
chief O@@ ates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical mari@@ juana growers , and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers .
in northern Colorado &apos;s W@@ eld County , the district attorney , Ken Bu@@ ck , represents a stricter view .
after the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing mari@@ juana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment .
right now , 119 people face charges of possessing two ounces or less of mari@@ juana , though many are facing other charges .
&quot; our office has an obligation to prosecute off@@ enses that were crimes at the time they occurred , &quot; Mr. Bu@@ ck said in a statement .
the response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County , where voters rejected the mari@@ juana initiative .
the police in Grand Jun@@ ction , the county &apos;s largest city , are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts .
the county &apos;s district attorney , Pete Hau@@ tz@@ inger , supported that decision , but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases .
&quot; I do not think I &apos;m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes , &quot; he said .
although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure , bringing recreational mari@@ juana into the folds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple .
and the contradictory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambi@@ valence among local officials about the state &apos;s big green experiment .
&quot; it &apos;s a cultural barrier &quot; with district attorneys , said Sean Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , a Denver lawyer who represents mari@@ juana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Mari@@ juana Laws .
&quot; they spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still don &apos;t really accept that this is legal , &quot; he said .
as the first states to treat small amounts of mari@@ juana like alcohol , Colorado and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug leg@@ alization .
as advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of leg@@ alized sales , they are also anxi@@ ously awaiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of mari@@ juana as federal crimes .
advocates for leg@@ alized mari@@ juana are hoping the Justice Department yields .
despite some high @-@ profile arrests of medical mari@@ juana patients and sellers , the federal government has mostly allowed medical mari@@ juana businesses to operate in Colorado , Washington and 16 other states .
while drug agents will probably not beat down doors to seize a small bag of the drug , they are likely to bal@@ k at allowing the state @-@ regulated recreational mari@@ juana shops allowed under the new laws , said Kevin A. Sab@@ et , a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration .
several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act .
even before Election Day , some local governments approved mor@@ atoriums on any new mari@@ juana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open .
last week , the western city of Mon@@ tro@@ se took up a six @-@ month ban , and is likely to pass it next week .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal issue , &quot; said Bob Nicholson , a City Council member .
our community voted against this amendment .
we &apos;re looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for .
there &apos;s an awful lot of questions .
Pet@@ ron@@ ella Wy@@ att : I was bul@@ lied out of Oxford for being a T@@ ory
it is not just today &apos;s university students who are attacked for their views
I can &apos;t remember a time when I didn &apos;t dream of winning a place at Oxford University .
both my father and my elder brother had been at what I imagined was the world &apos;s greatest seat of learning , a modern @-@ day wine @-@ bl@@ ushed Greek symposium encouraging the dual pillars of civilisation , free thinking and tolerance .
yet , within two weeks of taking up my place at Wor@@ cester College in the late Eigh@@ ties to read history , I &apos;d packed my bags , precip@@ itating the first scandal of my life .
my father broke down and cried .
friends were b@@ aff@@ led .
the Even@@ ing Standard diary claimed I &apos;d quit because I objected to fellow under@@ graduates having sex in the room next to mine .
the writer A N Wilson announced w@@ agg@@ ishly that I &apos;d departed because I was forced to drink out of chi@@ pped mu@@ gs .
the truth was less dro@@ ll .
I ran away .
yes , ran , because I had been subject to systematic bullying and intimidation .
not on account of my rather ou@@ tr@@ é name , or the fact that I came from a private school .
I was persecuted for one reason only , and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both big@@ oted and barbaric : my father , the late Woo@@ dro@@ w Wy@@ att , was a high @-@ profile adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative supporter .
why bring this up now , you might ask .
well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of Right @-@ of @-@ centre students are suffering a similar persecution .
such is the institutionalised and increasing hatred of T@@ ory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equal @-@ rights protection as g@@ ays , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
conservative members of Corpus Christi College &apos;s junior common room ( J@@ CR ) claim they are &quot; often actively isolated , personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome &quot; because of their political views .
they want to create a post on the college &apos;s equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be aired freely .
their situation wasn &apos;t helped by a recent BBC Two documentary , Wonder@@ land : young , Bright and on the Right , about student politics , which portrayed T@@ ories as od@@ d@@ balls and neo @-@ Nazis .
it featured graduate Joe Coo@@ ke , former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association ( O@@ UC@@ A ) , travelling in a Rolls @-@ Royce , sporting a silver suit and silver @-@ topped cane .
at other universities , Conservative students say they are being treated as &quot; scapego@@ ats &quot; for the introduction of higher tuition fees . &quot;
Luke Black , 20 , vice @-@ president of Nottingham University Conservative Association , told a Sunday newspaper that &quot; there is a growing Left @-@ wing bias at universities .
people assume we are like the Bul@@ ling@@ don Club without meeting us . &quot;
Samuel Roberts , 21 , a history student at Corpus Christi , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is &quot; uncomfortable , &quot; while Steph@@ anie Cher@@ ill , 19 , president elect of O@@ UC@@ A , says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of J@@ CR members towards people who are Right of centre .
&quot; this poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , &quot; she says .
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Oxford .
I had gone up in September 1986 , a crip@@ pl@@ ingly shy 18 @-@ year @-@ old .
hatred of the Conservative Party was at its most feb@@ ri@@ le .
the year before , the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree , because of cuts in higher education funding .
the atmosphere would have made a Stalinist sh@@ ud@@ der with apprehen@@ sion .
during the first few days of fresh@@ ers &quot; week , when new students soci@@ alise with each other and the d@@ ons , I had a taste of the worm@@ wood that was to come .
I was to find that the d@@ ons not only con@@ ni@@ ved in the ta@@ unting of T@@ ory under@@ graduates but took part with rel@@ ish .
the politics of the miners &quot; strike , privatisation and the government &apos;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa were brought into the wood @-@ pan@@ elled rooms of the tutorial .
my first one involved translating 18th @-@ century French texts into English , and I was un@@ prepared for what followed .
&quot; miss Wy@@ att , &quot; said the don , Harry Pitt ( now deceased ) , &quot; please translate the first paragraph . &quot;
I stum@@ bled over it .
a small man with a face like cake bat@@ ter , Pitt was big on bile .
&quot; do That@@ cher@@ ites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid ? &quot; he demanded .
the other under@@ graduates gig@@ gled .
tears pri@@ cked the back of my eyes .
&quot; I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time - that is , if you &apos;re not too busy soci@@ alising , &quot; Pitt sn@@ ar@@ led .
I walked back to my rooms a dis@@ con@@ sol@@ ate figure .
at dinner in college that evening I sat by myself ; then I felt a light tap on my shoulder .
it was a second @-@ year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ UC@@ A .
&quot; I know who you are , &quot; he said kindly .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s like that .
anyone suspected of being a T@@ ory is picked on .
it &apos;s bad enough for me , but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher , so it will be worse for you .
most T@@ ory fresh@@ ers pretend they &apos;re Labour .
later , at a local pub , I cra@@ ven@@ ly attempted to dis@@ simulate .
I insisted that I didn &apos;t agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said .
this plo@@ y proved unsuccessful .
a first year PPE student , who , ironically , had been to E@@ ton , said : &quot; you &apos;re the daughter of a fascist pig . &quot;
you &apos;re contaminated .
other students took up the refrain .
I was perverted , dirty .
&quot; how do T@@ ories have sex ? &quot; one asked .
they beat each other , don &apos;t they ?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Six@@ ties .
would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford ?
would I be forced to meet like @-@ minded people only after dark ?
would I have to turn to Labour and suppress my natural inc@@ lin@@ ations ?
the three years before me stretched out as a pur@@ g@@ atory of o@@ stra@@ cism and isolation .
the only openly T@@ ory don was Norman Stone , Professor of Modern History , who was based at my college .
he was hated for being not only a Conservative but a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speech writers .
he was hardly ever there .
he lo@@ ath@@ ed the place as provincial and petty , and for its adherence to the Marxist @-@ determin@@ ist view of history .
in 1997 he took up a profess@@ orship at the University of Bil@@ k@@ ent , in Ankara , Turkey .
&quot; you won &apos;t be happy here , &quot; he told me .
I began comm@@ uting from Oxford to my parents &quot; house in London , finding refuge with my more open @-@ minded metropolitan friends and family .
I told my father I hated Oxford and why .
he was incre@@ dul@@ ous .
during his time there in the For@@ ties , all political views had been accepted .
&quot; but it &apos;s the best place in the world , &quot; he said path@@ e@@ tically .
they wouldn &apos;t do that , not among my dreaming sp@@ ires .
even my Communist friends always had impeccable manners .
his rheum@@ y eyes began to cloud .
give it a chance .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s all just a te@@ ase .
it would break my heart if you left .
exhausted by my frequent trips to London , my emotional resistance was deteriorating .
a male friend of mine , also a T@@ ory supporter , had succum@@ bed to pressure and ren@@ ounced his cre@@ ed .
during a tutorial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete seriousness , that I was an &quot; enemy of the people , &quot; I decided to do the same .
in@@ wardly bl@@ ushing with shame , I admitted to being &quot; brain@@ washed by my parents &quot; and called them &quot; old fo@@ ols . &quot;
the respite was short .
it was my father who drove the nail into the coff@@ in of my Oxford career .
at the time , he wrote two columns in the Mur@@ doch press each week .
my door was locked .
I co@@ wered inside , and after five minutes , my pursu@@ ers gave up .
when they left , I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London .
I never went back .
you may call me a sni@@ v@@ elling wi@@ mp .
but no 18 @-@ year @-@ old should be subject to such intimidation and vit@@ ri@@ ol in an educational institution .
even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which not only produced 14 T@@ ory prime ministers , but , to this day , hides behind an ill @-@ deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought .
&quot; Valentino prefers elegance to notori@@ ety &quot;
on the occasion of the &quot; Valentino : master of Cou@@ ture , &quot; an exhibition that opened this week in London , ABC speaks with N@@ aty Ab@@ as@@ cal , Fi@@ ona Thyssen @-@ Born@@ emis@@ za and other of the Italian designer &apos;s famous clients .
Somer@@ set House , former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England , is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valentino Gar@@ av@@ ani exhibition .
during the inauguration of &quot; Valentino : master of Cou@@ ture , &quot; the designer acknowledged a retrospective apo@@ the@@ osis that brings together over 130 cou@@ ture g@@ owns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years .
&quot; I love this palace &quot; he says , in his unmistakable Italian accent .
this exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is &quot; sign@@ ore &quot; Gar@@ av@@ ani , although it could not have been written without his distinguished clients .
Valentino has always been fascinated by the r@@ are@@ fied and distant world of the nobility .
in the first room of the exhibition , open until March 3 , there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of aristocracy , from Princess Sali@@ mah Ag@@ a Khan , Lord Snow@@ don , Princess Marie @-@ Ch@@ antal of Greece to Margaret of England .
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as if they were trop@@ hies of his social ascent from humble cou@@ tur@@ ier in Vo@@ gh@@ era , northern Italy , to i@@ dol of the international jet @-@ set .
there is nothing wrong with loving royalty .
&quot; at least they don &apos;t drop cigarette ends on your magnificent carpet , like some beautiful pop music celebrities do , &quot; says Baroness Fi@@ ona Thyssen @-@ Born@@ emis@@ za .
in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , we both lived in the Alps and were good friends .
Valentino is a spectacular host whose enter@@ tains with generosity and elegance .
&quot; we all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad &quot; says &quot; Hein@@ i &quot; Thyssen &apos;s ex @-@ wife , a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Mar@@ ella Agn@@ elli and Eugen@@ ie Ni@@ arch@@ os .
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notori@@ ety .
and yet , he is a star .
Val@@ eria Ma@@ zza , wearing a Valentino .
the Argentine model Val@@ eria Ma@@ zza also recalls the cou@@ tur@@ ier &apos;s charisma .
many years ago , after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome , we went for dinner at his flat .
there were twenty of us , including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr .
you could see and feel his &quot; spirit &quot; in every detail of the flat and its decor , the food and the music .
&quot; all the guests were made to feel important and loved &quot; recalls the top model , who started working with him during Haute Cou@@ ture Week Paris , in 1995 .
&quot; his designs are works of art and so never go out of fashion &quot; she concludes .
nobility parade
Gar@@ av@@ ani &apos;s life is not a story of obsession , but of well reciproc@@ ated love .
he loves well @-@ educated people who come from good backgrounds , and they love him .
one of the Somer@@ set House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous , sixty @-@ foot long cat@@ walk which offers a role reversal : visitors take the place of the models and have to parade down the cat@@ walk while looking at a dream &quot; audience &quot; wearing Valentino masterpieces , for example , the dress Jack@@ ie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle On@@ assis , the costume Monica Vit@@ ti wore in &quot; La Not@@ te &quot; and the wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Far@@ ah Di@@ ba .
in this crowd of man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , names stand out such as Si@@ bil@@ la of Luxembourg , Gloria von Th@@ urn und Taxis , M@@ ette @-@ Mar@@ it of Norway , Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Habsburg .
N@@ aty Ab@@ as@@ cal and the designer , in 2006
many of these clients say your first Valentino is like your first love , &quot; impossible to forget . &quot;
I remember it perfectly .
it was a pair of trousers , a shirt , a &quot; gil@@ et &quot; wa@@ ist@@ coat and jacket from the 1971 @-@ 1972 autumn @-@ winter collection .
&quot; it was a gift he gave me &quot; says N@@ aty Ab@@ as@@ cal , one of the designer &apos;s m@@ uses .
&quot; I prefer him to other designers because of his femin@@ inity , his great love of women , and because he enhances our beauty &quot; added the former Du@@ chess of Feria .
I love the colours he uses , they really stand out and &quot; lend themselves &quot; to your face .
their proportions are perfect .
the princess and fashion advisor Patricia della Giov@@ amp@@ a@@ ola d &apos;Ar@@ enberg also remembers the first time she wore a Valentino .
as a teenager living in Italy , I dreamed of reaching the age when I &apos;d have the chance to wear one of his evening g@@ owns ...
my time finally came in the late &apos; 90s .
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my cousin , Prince E@@ douard de Lig@@ ne .
it was a red dress , with a fri@@ lly skirt , d@@ raped &quot; cor@@ sage &quot; and a stra@@ pless nec@@ k@@ line .
&quot; it was a dream come true &quot; says Princess D &apos;Ar@@ enberg , the widow of Rodrigo d &apos;Ar@@ enberg .
&quot; Valentino is indifferent to fashion , his obsession is timeless &quot; says this Italian aristoc@@ rat who lives between Paris , New York and Buenos Aires .
Princess D &apos;Ar@@ enberg looks after her cou@@ tur@@ ier g@@ owns with &quot; the utmost care ... because a dress not just a dress , it &apos;s also the many memories that go with it . &quot;
the &quot; king &quot; of fashion
the &quot; grand finale &quot; of the Somer@@ set House exhibition is Marie @-@ Ch@@ antal Miller &apos;s wedding dress from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995 .
it took four months &apos; work and 25 &quot; girls &quot; ( as the designer calls his seam@@ stresses ) to create the pearl @-@ en@@ cru@@ sted , ivory @-@ coloured silk g@@ own with twelve different types of lace and a train four and a half metres long .
according to journalist Su@@ zy Men@@ kes , the leading authority of the specialist press , that dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century , &quot; the return of high society clients . &quot;
da@@ zzled for years with the &quot; savoir @-@ être &quot; of the elite , Valentino is now its finest expon@@ ent .
Cav@@ ali@@ ere di Gran Croce ( the highest @-@ ranking distinction in Italy ) , Cav@@ ali@@ ere del La@@ vor@@ o , Comm@@ an@@ deur de L &apos;Or@@ dre des Arts et des Let@@ tres , and awarded the Legion of Hon@@ our , Gar@@ av@@ ani accum@@ ulates as many honours as any of his clients &apos; husbands .
&quot; I &apos;ve always been struck by his refined and calm manner , and his neat and perfect appearance &quot; acknowledges D &apos;Ar@@ enberg .
the last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum .
he was on the table of Coun@@ t@@ ess Jacqu@@ eline de Ri@@ bes , a great friend of mine .
&quot; he was immaculate , time stands still for him . &quot;
if a princess says that ...
the hardest job in the world : the human mul@@ es of Ka@@ w@@ ah I@@ jen
for four euros , the Indonesian volcano porters risk life and limb carrying 70 kilos of sulphur along steep stone paths .
there are people for whom work is hell , and others who - literally - work in hell .
this is the case of An@@ to Wij@@ aya , one of the 400 miners who make their living taking sulphur from the Ka@@ w@@ ah I@@ jen volcano , east of the Indonesian island of Java .
to do so , he has to descend every day to the bottom of the crater , where the sulph@@ ur@@ ous gas emanating from the bow@@ els of the earth solidi@@ fies on contact with air .
after breaking off large sulphur rocks , which in total can weigh up to 70 kilos , he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths .
it is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano , which rises to 2,@@ 386 metres above sea level , but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to get there , at sn@@ ail &apos;s pace , keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid slipping and falling over the precip@@ ice .
they know that one slip could cost them their lives , as happened to a French tourist who plunged to her death a few years ago on the hazardous Ka@@ w@@ ah I@@ jen cliffs .
the Ka@@ w@@ ah I@@ jen miners are paid 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulphur removed .
once at the top , they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and then , lu@@ gging their heavy baskets , they walk three kilometres to the scales installed by a mining company a little further down , 1,@@ 850 metres above sea level .
this is PT N@@ gri@@ m@@ bi Can@@ di , a company which , since 1960 , has been exploiting the volcano , and quite literally its workers , whom it pays 6@@ 62 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 5 euro cents ) per kilo of sulphur .
it then sells the sulphur for 10,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 83 cents ) to the petro@@ chemical industry , as the mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufacture of matches , fireworks , cosmetics , dynam@@ ite and even for whit@@ ening sugar .
&quot; we generally carry 70 kilos , so we get about 46@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 3.8 euros ) a trip &quot; explains An@@ to , who usually make three trips a day .
each one takes three hours and you end up exhausted , but it means he gets 13@@ 8,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 11.@@ 5 euros ) at the end of the day .
although it seems a pitt@@ ance for such an inhuman effort , it is three times what he would earn in the field .
&quot; miners &apos; wages are very high here , whereas coffee harvesting is paid 15,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 1.2 euros ) a day and the average monthly wage is two million ru@@ pe@@ es ( 167 euros ) &quot; explains the porter , who previously worked as a mas@@ on in the island resort of Bali .
there , his wage was 7@@ 5,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 6.2 euros ) a day and the work was not as hard , but An@@ to has returned with his family to B@@ any@@ u@@ wan@@ gi , a village near the volcano , for a compelling reason which , in Indonesia , is as overriding as the sulphur : &quot; I married a girl from Bali , where they are Hindu , and I &apos;ve brought her to Java to convert to Islam . &quot;
An@@ to has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , cou@@ ghs constantly and his eyes are irrit@@ ated by the toxic gases .
at 27 years old , An@@ to has been risking his life for three years in the Ka@@ w@@ ah I@@ jen volcano , and the sulphur has already begun to take its toll on him , even though he covers his face with special mask and gog@@ gles .
he has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , cou@@ ghs constantly and his eyes are irrit@@ ated by the toxic gases from the volcano .
this is the price you have to pay to realise your dreams .
&quot; I &apos;ll go on working two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French &quot; he v@@ ows in more than acceptable English .
punished for life , this pleasant , intelligent young man could be a tour guide , waiter or hotel receptionist , but instead he does the work of a mu@@ le .
sharing a fil@@ thy wooden hut with other porters , he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulphur doesn &apos;t stop flowing at night , when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it g@@ lows in the dark .
def@@ ying the shadows , An@@ to desc@@ ends the crater and lights the path with a small torch attached to the helmet he bought with his money .
some 400 porters carry sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the crater .
despite their huge profits , the mining company has not mechan@@ ised the sulphur extraction process to save costs , nor has it provided any equipment for the porters , who work for themselves and by the kilo .
in fact , they do not even see any of the 30,000 ru@@ pee ( 2.5 euro ) per camera surcharge that , on top of the 15,000 ru@@ pee ( 1.2 euro ) entrance fee , the guards of this natural reserve charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and their human mul@@ es .
&quot; this work is for animals , not people &quot; protests Mad@@ rus@@ in , a bur@@ ly 42 @-@ year porter who has been working at Ka@@ w@@ ah I@@ jen for three decades , since leaving school .
he can lift up to 110 kilos , ensuring that he will go on working &quot; all he can &quot; because he needs the money to educate his three children , aged between 18 &#91; months ? &#93; and 10 years old .
I won &apos;t retire , I &apos;ll die here because the volcano has been my whole life .
although the sulphur burns your throat and st@@ ings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano , they are so har@@ dy that no @-@ one compl@@ ains of serious illnesses ... apart , of course , from their common respiratory problems , oste@@ o@@ arthritis , knee pain and sor@@ es on the shoulders , which have been mis@@ sha@@ pen by the weight of the baskets .
balancing the basket on his back , Un@@ ain@@ ik can only carry 50 kilos now he is 53 years old .
every day , he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano , which three lorries move to the warehouse in Tam@@ ans@@ ari , 18 kilometres away along a goat path that passes through sc@@ rub@@ land .
&quot; I won &apos;t retire , I &apos;ll die here because the volcano has been my whole life &quot; says Un@@ ain@@ ik , opening a mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be .
the oldest of his five children , 30 years old , also works carrying sulphur .
time passes , but poverty perpetu@@ ates from generation to generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world : the one done by human mul@@ es in the Ka@@ w@@ ah I@@ jen volcano .
Singapore seeks babies to save its economy
Singapor@@ eans blame their careers , stress and the cost of property and education for not having children .
&quot; Singapore &apos;s population needs to grow . &quot;
I &apos;m a patriotic husband , you &apos;re my patriotic wife , let &apos;s do our civic duty and create life !
it may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an adver@@ t for mint sweets , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year .
the phrases are part of a rap and make use of local references such as &quot; Let &apos;s put a bao ( bun ) in the oven &quot; to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore .
the advertising company that made the video , BB@@ H , is hopeful that the advertisement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way .
its creative director , Douglas Hamilton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their &quot; national duty . &quot;
it &apos;s purely an Internet thing , so we had to make it fun and amusing .
it &apos;s the biggest problem facing this country .
we are the world &apos;s worst at reproducing our own pro@@ gen@@ y , so we felt it was an issue we had to address .
we knew the Government had tried many things , like launching perfumes with pher@@ om@@ ones or organising speed dating evenings .
many of these ideas may have been creative , but they didn &apos;t necessarily work .
so we thought : why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem , by composing a rap ?
1.2 children
but the Singapore Government is not taking it so lightly .
it spends USD 1,@@ 300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children .
a government package for marriages and parents grants up to USD 15,000 per child , extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits .
but this has all had little effect .
Singapore is a rich , high technology city State in Southeast Asia , also known for the conserv@@ atism of its leaders and its strict social controls .
the birth rate in Singapore , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1.2 children per woman .
the last time it was over 2 , known as the replacement rate , was in 1976 .
so why are Singapor@@ eans not having children ?
tan Wei Ming , Director of Marri@@ age and Family Policy of the National Population Division , said that it is a result of &quot; better education &quot; and &quot; a wider range of career opportunities . &quot;
&quot; this has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities , beyond getting married and starting a family &quot; he explains .
these changes in social norms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and delaying marriage and bir@@ ths , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore .
meanwhile , an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population .
in Singapore , there are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thin@@ ly disguised , especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating .
increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why , last year , the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence .
since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the highest taxes and levies for foreign workers .
unexpected consequences
while a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation &apos;s economic growth , tax revenues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , in Singapore &apos;s case there are also some unexpected consequences .
the Government is trying not to build so many small houses .
for example , it has started to influence the real estate sector .
its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments , known as &quot; shoe boxes , &quot; which can be built in certain areas of the city .
these apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales .
however , there is concern that they may promote a single @-@ living lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family houses .
but , L@@ im Y@@ ew So@@ on , managing director of the real estate company EL Developers , says his &quot; shoe boxes &quot; sell much faster than larger units .
they are more popular , in the sense that the units sell days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
this means they are much better for our cash flow .
however , he admits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers , who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project .
too stressed
Singapore is a city State .
although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to Singapor@@ eans working in the central financial district , it seems they will not have much impact .
&quot; people are very stressed , houses are expensive and so is education , so a lot of people are putting off having a family &quot; says a young executive .
other people can have children .
&quot; but , for me , it is important to have my own money and time &quot; says another young man of around 20 years old .
men and women alike mention their careers , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children .
so , much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children , when it comes to babies , the Singapor@@ eans have the last word .
what is private offline is private online
privacy .
according to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary , it means the quality of private life or &quot; the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference . &quot;
what is privacy for an under 16 ?
how do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks ?
do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the Internet which they probably would not share offline ?
El@@ Peri@@ ó@@ dic@@ o interviewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users .
in four cases , they associated the term with &quot; something very much mine &quot; on a personal level , and &quot; in the user name and password &quot; when applied to social networks .
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t upload my deepest secrets in a post &quot; says Jorge , aged ten , when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook , Twitter , Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger , with which he has had accounts for two years .
&quot; they are very secret secrets , I &apos;ll tell my mother , but not everybody &quot; he says .
on FB I upload nice pictures or games .
and I have fun with people I know .
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t share a photo that isn &apos;t mine , or that belongs to somebody who &apos;s doing something stupid &quot; he says .
the child recognises that it is bad to post obscene pictures of naked people , crimes , or write humiliating or aggressive comments .
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter .
most are relatives .
his mother is included , and she has the password to one of the accounts .
I opened Twitter to express myself and post interesting twe@@ ets .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if they answer me , I only upload them &quot; he adds .
&quot; social networking is fun , I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends &quot; he says .
he does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person .
nor would he take any notice of someone who recommends a stranger to him .
the case of Joseph , aged 14 , is different .
this teenager has accounts with Hotmail , Facebook , My Space and Ask , and in the last case he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t bother me , because we have something in common , like music &quot; he says .
the boy says that no @-@ one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number .
&quot; if they pressur@@ ed me or asked me for it , I &apos;d just delete them from my account &quot; he states .
Joseph became a follow@@ er on Ask , after reading a recommendation on Twitter .
this teenager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cyber@@ bullying .
an acquaintance of a friend of mine was being p@@ ester@@ ed on a social network .
they were threatening him and demanding money from him .
&quot; I never found out who it was &quot; he says .
the victim , according to José , did not close his account .
&quot; he just made it private . &quot;
he then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely .
unlike Jorge , this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations .
I would do it if I didn &apos;t like somebody , or they made me want to do it .
&quot; however , I know that &apos;s cyber@@ bullying &quot; he admits .
key questions
Mari@@ elos Por@@ ras , an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning , believes that to guide children and teenagers , they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform .
&quot; the Internet emerged as a means of searching for information , but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game changed &quot; he says .
Por@@ ras says the scholar Marc Pr@@ ens@@ ky , with a Master &apos;s degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Digital N@@ atives , Digital Im@@ migrants , coined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
digital natives are those children and young people born with technology .
&quot; we are the digital immigrants who have to teach them , when we are still in fact learning &quot; he says .
he says that the issue is complex , &quot; because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclose , publish or divul@@ ge , at an age at which maturity is not conducive to this . &quot;
&quot; they also have to be selective when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends , without thinking of the consequences &quot; he adds .
according to the specialist , the most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think .
&quot; telling them not to do it is no good &quot; he adds .
Por@@ ras then lists some options : there are things you wouldn &apos;t tell a stranger , so why do it online ?
or , would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend ?
do you know what others publish about you ?
when tag@@ ging party photos , did you ask the other people &apos;s permission to tag them ?
and one more question : does everyone need to know what you &apos;re doing all the time ?
another point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do offline .
the rules are the same .
&quot; outside the Internet , people act with respect , morality and other principles , so they should act the same way on social networks &quot; he says .
monitoring
Stuart Guard , a university professor , primary school teacher and educational consultant , says it is essential for parents to read social networks &apos; policies thoroughly .
by understanding all the clauses , they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account .
&quot; for example , the age at which you are allowed to share or publish &quot; he says .
according to Guardia , it is important to remind children the &quot; don &apos;t talk to strangers &quot; lesson .
UN@@ AS@@ UR Summit closes without making public the Lima Declaration
the Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations ( Un@@ asur ) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration , previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven atten@@ dee leaders .
EF@@ E repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Sixth UN@@ AS@@ UR Meeting of Heads of State and Government , but Presidential and Chanc@@ ell@@ ery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peruvian Government website .
when asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been disclosed by Peruvian President , Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala , during a brief statement to the press .
journalists &apos; access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times .
during the summit , in the press room , only video was aired , with no sound , showing the presidential meeting with the message &quot; closed session , audio restricted . &quot;
the little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spokes@@ men of some of the UN@@ AS@@ UR governments attending the meeting , but not the Peruvian Government .
the only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents , which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media , who asked for more details .
the Peruvian President then sent an email to the media with the &quot; final statement &quot; of the summit , but this was Hum@@ ala &apos;s statement , and not the official document that closed the summit .
last October , Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American @-@ Arab Countries ( AS@@ PA ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced Lima Declaration was again not made public .
the AS@@ PA official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday .
at both international events , the Peruvian authorities were at pains to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists , but limited the obtaining of information to a maximum .
the summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to adju@@ dic@@ ate a border dispute between the two countries .
the Presidents of Peru , Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala , and Chile , Sebastián Pi@@ ñ@@ era , met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice ( IC@@ J ) , which on Monday , at The Hague , will start to hear the arguments of both parties , in the lawsuit Lima has filed against Santiago .
&quot; we will obey and execute the order that currently defines the differences we are bringing before this international court &quot; said Hum@@ ala , together with his Chilean counterpart .
&quot; Chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes , treaties and international courts &quot; added Pi@@ ñ@@ era , greeting Hum@@ ala with a hand@@ shake , alongside the flags of the two countries .
confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the IC@@ J came after Colombia this week denounced the Bog@@ ot@@ á Pact , whereby it accepted to submit to the judgement of this international court , following a decision on its maritime boundary with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously flawed .
the summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil , Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff ; Venezuela , Hugo Chavez ; Bolivia , Evo Morales ; and Argentina , Cristina Kirchner .
Paraguay , which was suspended by UN@@ AS@@ UR in 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lu@@ go , was not involved in the meeting .
host President Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit , just after noon in Lima .
the President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries , for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments .
among the resolutions adopted , it was mentioned that UN@@ AS@@ UR countries will take &quot; important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended . &quot;
he reported that actions are being implemented to improve &quot; cooperation in the fight against insecurity and transnational organised crime , actions to make medication more accessible , low @-@ cost Internet access in all areas of South America , and to deal jointly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters . &quot;
with Europe in crisis , &quot; economic consolidation ( in Latin America ) should not have a trium@@ phal@@ ist attitude but should serve to expand its productive matrix and glimpse a better future for its people &quot; Hum@@ ala added .
&quot; we decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America , especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and creating new economic networks &quot; said the Peruvian President in a message read out .
among these projects , he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the trans@@ verse axes of its territory , between the coast and Brazil , and two focus on increased connection with Ecuador , although he gave no further details .
also , the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay .
&quot; we hope the electoral process in that country serves to re@@ incorporate it in the Union of South American Nations , &quot; from which it is currently excluded .
the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous , peaceful and integrated nation , with good neighbourly relations , was another issue highlighted by the summit .
in this sense , the President of Colombia , Juan Manuel Santos , said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , on Saturday in Mexico , to respec@@ tfully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the IC@@ J , questioned by Bog@@ ota .
&quot; the day after tomorrow ( Saturday ) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega &quot; Santos said .
&quot; we will review all these paths , &#91; which &#93; are not exclusive , and the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua &quot; he emphasised .
&quot; with President Ortega , I hope I can say that we handle this in the most civilised and respectful manner possible &quot; said Santos .
Santos and Ortega are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they expect to attend the inauguration of the country &apos;s new President , Enrique Peña N@@ ie@@ to .
also , as part of the summit , the bloc &apos;s foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Chile , Guyana , Surin@@ am and Paraguay make up UN@@ AS@@ UR , although the latter is currently suspended .
Peru has the pro tempor@@ e presidency of the regional bloc .
&quot; South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship &quot; says Rafael Cor@@ rea
the President of Ecuador , Rafael Cor@@ rea , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that &quot; South America , in this case , must learn from Europe . &quot;
Cor@@ rea , who took part in the Ele@@ ven@@ th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ AS@@ UR ) held in Lima , told Peru &apos;s state television that Europeans &quot; killed one another in the Second World War &quot; and other conflicts , &quot; but are now practically one country . &quot;
to this end , he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of UN@@ AS@@ UR .
&quot; we have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country , as is already the situation with members of the Andean Community . however , there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past &quot; he said .
the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States ( O@@ AS ) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo @-@ Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the Pact of San José on human rights .
those who speak with authority never commit to anything , whereas we South Americans sign everything .
&quot; it is incomprehensible that the Inter @-@ American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding &quot; he said referring to Ecuador giving political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Ass@@ ange .
Cor@@ rea said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles , but has respected his &quot; deep democratic and human rights values . &quot;
he added that , at the time , &quot; he had reasonable suspicion that Ass@@ ange would be extradi@@ ted to another country and that his case would not be respected . &quot;
additionally , he criticised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to questioning for an alleged sexual offence in his country , when &quot; Swedish legislation itself dictates that he can be questioned via video@@ conference , which could be done from the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian Embassy in London . &quot;
Cor@@ rea said that there is a risk of deterioration of Ass@@ ange &apos;s physical and mental health .
&quot; I have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy , but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing serious &quot; said the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian President .
what there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may deteriorate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise .
&quot; that would complicate the health of any person &quot; he added .
Cor@@ rea said that the solution to the asylum granted to Ass@@ ange in June by the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian Embassy , in London , through the issue of a safe @-@ conduct pass that permits travel to Ecuador , is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder .
we do not negotiate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been ongoing discussions .
&quot; the solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , because Ass@@ ange &apos;s lawyer , Bal@@ ta@@ zar Gar@@ zon , is handling a series of cases in different European courts &quot; he said .
and he felt that &quot; if Britain says no to the safe @-@ conduct pass , it &apos;s over . &quot;
and if Sweden , as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions Mr Ass@@ ange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London , or inter@@ ro@@ gates him via Skype tomorrow , this problem is over .
Cor@@ rea took the opportunity to reas@@ sert himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not tolerate is &quot; the medioc@@ rity , dishon@@ esty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression . &quot;
&quot; the greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil and wicked politicians , but bad journalists depending on profit , blackmail and extor@@ tion &quot; he said .
in that regard , he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists , &quot; or the bankers or bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate Ecuador &quot; and said that , if re @-@ elected , he will &quot; step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direction . &quot;
Cor@@ rea also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in UN@@ AS@@ UR , at least until their next elections , arguing that the body &quot; must be firm and not tolerate opportun@@ ism and a coup masked with legality &quot; because this will in fact &quot; destroy the legitimacy of Paragu@@ ay@@ an democracy . &quot;
the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian President also considered the &quot; perfectly pertinent &quot; desire of his Colombian counterpart , Juan Manuel Santos , to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries , after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague , in favour Nicar@@ agu@@ an maritime sovereignty .
for now that ruling is not being followed .
it is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one .
conflict is inevitable , but must be overcome by the desire to walk together .
they need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward .
additionally , he trusted in a sound conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute opposing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that &quot; it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however hard it may be . &quot;
with reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador seeking a third consecutive term , he said he sees that possibility &quot; with much optimism and joy , although at times it is pretty hard . &quot;
Cor@@ rea said that if he loses the elections in February 2013 , he will retire from public life .
personally , I &apos;ve never been interested in power , but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador , socio @-@ economic poverty can only be corrected by political power .
&quot; my political movement believed that it was me who ensured that probable victory , so we have to accept that responsibility &quot; he said .
if I won , it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life .
if I lose , likewise .
&quot; it &apos;s a decision &quot; he confirmed .
Cor@@ rea also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez &apos;s new health treatment in Cuba .
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro and he tells me that Chavez went for treatment that was already planned , routine treatment , and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba .
&quot; this does not mean a health rel@@ apse for President Chavez &quot; he said .
in Lima today , the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian Head of State attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ AS@@ UR ) , which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress , equality and security .
deaths caused by AIDS are nowadays due to late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result : HIV positive .
&quot; it was like a bomb dropped on me &quot; he says , recalling the time of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to make &quot; softer , &quot; apparently un@@ successfully .
the boy hid it from his family .
he decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it ; thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 4@@ 3rd birthday .
he is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guadal@@ ajara Civil Hospital ( Ch@@ g ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health .
Fabrizio has lived with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , hard to imagine in the early &apos; 90s , when there were many questions , few treatment options and a great deal of stig@@ ma .
then , even the director of an IM@@ SS &#91; Mexican Social Security Institute &#93; clinic refused to discharge him &quot; because he had a cut . &quot;
at that time , having Aids was synonymous with death .
now it is possible to survive the syndrome and do so with quality of life .
however , many people are still unaware of their illness , and only seek help when the virus has already caused havoc , &quot; exhausted &quot; their immune systems and they are suffering from opportun@@ istic infections .
31 years after of the onset of AIDS around the world , at least since the first reported cases , &quot; the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equal &quot; stated the head of the Ch@@ g HIV Unit , Jaime An@@ dra@@ de Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva , saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal .
infectious disease specialist and expert in HIV / AIDS , An@@ dra@@ de Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence , but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagnosed , with a higher life expectancy for non @-@ drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD@@ 4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD@@ 4 count .
in simple terms , this means that anyone diagnosed HIV positive at 25 years old , under these terms and &quot; as long as they keep it under control , can live with no problems to 75 &quot; said the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ e .
to gauge this progress , it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mex@@ icans today is 76 years .
although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years and , in the case of Mexico , the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,@@ 6@@ 78 in 2007 to 4,@@ 8@@ 62 in 2011 ( UN@@ AIDS annual report ) , it is also true that since the advent of AIDS , 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died .
in J@@ alis@@ co alone , only 255 people died in 2011 , and there have been 187 deaths up to May of this year ; however , we are assured that there has been universal access to anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs since 2005 .
- Why are do still deaths occur ?
- I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment .
that &apos;s how I view it , and that &apos;s how it &apos;s been at our hospital .
for at least the last 12 years we &apos;ve had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are unaware of their HIV status , that is to say , the later stages of the disease .
he gave a compelling statistic : &quot; nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportun@@ istic infection , so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagno@@ ses and , therefore , offer mass detection tests for everyone who needs them . &quot;
specialists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Prevention in J@@ alis@@ co ( CO@@ ES@@ IDA ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as Fabrizio , who came to be tested at a private laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Ka@@ posi sar@@ com@@ a , a can@@ cer@@ ous tum@@ our that is one of the common complications .
everything changes when you know you have AIDS .
some people think they &apos;re going to die and don &apos;t want to know anything .
&quot; if I &apos;m going to die , I &apos;d rather have a blow @-@ out three times a week &quot; they say , but not in my case .
the change was for the better ; I eat well , I exercise , I take my drugs .
to date , his parents are only aware he had cancer .
I live as normal a life as anyone else .
&quot; I work , I take part in a lot of activities , I travel , I have an active but responsible sex life , I take care of myself and the other person &quot; said Fabrizio , who agreed to share his intimate secrets with MIL@@ EN@@ IO J@@ AL@@ IS@@ CO , to motivate those people with his story who today , in the context of World AIDS Day , are afraid .
they should get tested if they are at risk@@ . because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive , the better , and if they have already been diagnosed , they must learn to live like any other person , while being responsible .
this is his message , which summar@@ ises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012 .
con@@ doms behind the counter .
the gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge , said Ricardo Sal@@ azar , a journalist from Guadal@@ ajara who has taken up the HIV cause .
and the greatest cure is prevention .
in places dedicated to this task &quot; the distribution of con@@ doms has actually increased ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us packets of a hundred , and that &apos;s fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access con@@ doms &quot; he said .
among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers .
&quot; why do you want them ? &quot; is a common question , asked with sar@@ cas@@ m and judged according to the values of social workers , coun@@ s@@ ell@@ ors , pharmacy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to expose teenagers to sex , said the speaker .
it was decided to change such inefficient allocation , and that con@@ doms should not only be placed behind counters , but that packets of one hundred should be found in public toilet disp@@ en@@ sers in places frequented by young people .
this is not promoting promis@@ cu@@ ity .
it is not about paying for their beers or motel fees , as Governor Emi@@ lio Gonz@@ al@@ ez said , when asked if there would be distribution of con@@ doms during his administration .
&quot; and it &apos;s not about sexuality , but it is best to provide con@@ doms to those already practising sexual activity &quot; he said .
J@@ alis@@ co key points
there are 13,@@ 4@@ 35 cumulative cases ( 12,@@ 158 AIDS and 1,@@ 317 HIV ) .
the state is 4th in the nation in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV .
92 % of new infections are through sex , 6 % via the blood@@ stream and 2 % per@@ in@@ atal .
an estimated 50,000 people may be living with HIV , as for each registered case there are around 4 @-@ 5 people who do not know they are positive .
ratified by a United States court of appeal , a judgement which ignores the restructuring of the Vit@@ ro Group &apos;s debt achieved via a bankruptcy in Mexico , the scenario is an omin@@ ous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems .
it seems , then , that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mexican law are not valid in the land of stars and stripes , contrary to international conventions .
in practical terms , the endorsement of the judgement delivered on 15 June by Judge Har@@ lin H@@ ale of the Bank@@ rupt@@ cy Court of the Northern District of Texas , leaves Mexican firms defenceless against possible seizure of their property outside of Mexico .
however , the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States , claiming three inconsistencies .
from the start , while the trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bank@@ rupt@@ cy Code , the Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit , based in New Orleans , states that the main action is the insolvency action handled in Mexico .
the first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profiles .
indeed , the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uni@@ formity was created for this purpose , with the American Law Institute positioned as arbitr@@ ator .
secondly , the judgement establishes that without the inter@@ company vote , with the debts the Vit@@ ro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised in the critical mass of the insolvency , the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved .
however , Mexican law recognises the possibility .
in fact , the Vit@@ ro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted .
there are half a dozen examples , including Agre@@ m@@ ex and Commercial Mex@@ ic@@ ana , whose inter@@ company debts were endorsed by the Federal Bank@@ rupt@@ cy Institute .
what is also certain is that , not including the votes of subsidiaries , the Vit@@ ro creditors who fought against it in the US courts , namely &quot; vul@@ ture &quot; funds such as Aur@@ eli@@ os Capital , Aur@@ eli@@ os Conver@@ gence , Elli@@ ot International and Liverpool Limited , did not achieve a majority .
the vote was apparently 45 percent versus 37 .

balance Sheet
with the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mex@@ ic@@ ana Airlines against the former owner of the company , Gast@@ ón Az@@ c@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga An@@ dra@@ de , who is accused of mismanagement , dormant for several months , the Airline Pil@@ ots Union Association already found the bottlen@@ eck .
the proceedings headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Mor@@ ine@@ au has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission , which is accused of obstruc@@ ting justice .
the claim is that the supervisory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the Attorney General &apos;s Office on a transaction carried out by the employer to remove 198 million pes@@ os from trust F / 5@@ 89 of Ban@@ co IX@@ e , on behalf of Mex@@ ic@@ ana de Avi@@ ación .
the resources were apparently channelled towards the purchase of shares in the company Administ@@ ra@@ dor@@ a Profes@@ ional de Hoteles .
as you know , Az@@ car@@ ra@@ ga An@@ dra@@ de is the main shareholder of the Po@@ sa@@ das hotel chain .
opposing Dragon Mart
a group of local and foreign environment@@ alists , academics , businessmen and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun .
as you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean , selling Chinese products , with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies .
previously , Can@@ ac@@ intra had managed to unite the governors of the southeast of Mexico to oppose the monumental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry .
the death of ACTA
the Government ignored an order of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti @-@ Counter@@ fei@@ ting Trade Agreement , known by its acronym ACTA , according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property , and the matter has already been archived .
as you know , the action was taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possibility , de@@ eming it an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks .

H@@ ector &quot; He@@ tin &quot; Reyes : &quot; basketball has been my life &quot;
basketball glo@@ bet@@ rot@@ ter H@@ ector &quot; He@@ tin &quot; Reyes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and , thanks to it , travelled the world .
few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recoll@@ ection of local basketball history as broad as that of Hé@@ c@@ tor &quot; He@@ tin &quot; Reyes .
Reyes was immersed in the sport for over 60 years before being confined to a wheelchair in 2008 following a stroke ; he was a minor league player , National Superior Basketball player , B@@ SN representative and manager with the Bay@@ am@@ ón V@@ aqu@@ eros or President of the Basketball Federation .
&quot; I wore lots of hats in basketball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when I was president of the B@@ SN , general manager and feder@@ ative president of the National Team during the &apos; 90s , &quot; recalled Reyes during Primera Hora &apos;s visit to his home in Bay@@ am@@ ón , where he lives with Isabel , his loyal wife for over 50 years .
&quot; basketball has been my life . &quot;
Reyes is not exagger@@ ating when he makes that statement .
the walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memor@@ abili@@ a den@@ oting his long career , which goes to prove it .
Bay@@ am@@ ón at heart
of them all , the ones he treasures with the most emotion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the V@@ aqu@@ eros , from the mid @-@ 50s as a player until 1982 , when he completed 15 years serving as co @-@ agent or agent of the franchise .
&quot; those were my best years , the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the V@@ aqu@@ eros &apos; eight championships , since 1967 , either as agent , co @-@ agent or manager .
there were many good years , including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975 .
and then I said goodbye with one in 1981 , Jer@@ ome M@@ inc@@ y &apos;s debut year in the B@@ SN .
then &quot; Cu@@ co &quot; Orti@@ z took over - he was a great manager &quot; said Reyes .
I remember that Gene Bar@@ tow , who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama ( Birmingham ) , said to me &apos; I &apos;ve got a very strong player for you , 6 &apos; 7 &quot; tall .
do you want him ? &apos;
and that was the beginning of M@@ inc@@ y , one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had .
Bar@@ tow then recommended the Shar@@ p@@ shooter G@@ aus@@ se Raymond , who established residency here and was one of our best sho@@ oters .
I remember him saying that if M@@ inc@@ y had given Bay@@ amon one championship , G@@ aus@@ se would help get another .
the V@@ aqu@@ eros &apos; championship with G@@ aus@@ se was enjoyed , but from a distance , because in 1988 he was already becoming a feder@@ ative big@@ shot .
for that time , he preferred to enjoy his own and M@@ inc@@ y &apos;s accomplishments in the national team .
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre @-@ Olympics in Mexico .
then came the 1990 World Cup , where we came fourth and it should have been bronze , but for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time , said Reyes .
is the 1990 World National Team the best you &apos;ve ever seen ?
it &apos;s one of the best , as good as the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics .
however , my favourite was the one in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba , when we won gold and gave the US team a beating , which was quite similar to the time we won bronze at the World Cup .
that team not only again included M@@ inc@@ y , G@@ aus@@ se , Ram@@ on Ri@@ vas , F@@ ico López and &apos; P@@ icul@@ ín &apos; ( Orti@@ z ) , but also the young ( Javier ) &apos; To@@ ñ@@ ito &apos; Colón and James Carter , the Leon brothers ( Francisco and Edgar ) and Mario &apos; Qu@@ ij@@ ote &apos; Morales , who was kept out of the 90 team by a knee injury .
a team that maybe was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a gold medal and was a great joy to work with , was the 1995 Pre @-@ Olympic team in Neu@@ qu@@ en , Argentina .
with role players such as &apos; Can@@ ito &apos; N@@ ieves , Pablo Alic@@ ea and the young Rol@@ ando H@@ our@@ ru@@ it@@ iner replacing the players suspended after the sh@@ amb@@ les of the Mar del Plata Pan @-@ American Games , we won gold against all the odds .
who was the best Puerto Ric@@ an player ?
without any doubt , P@@ icul@@ ín Orti@@ z .
his numbers at international tournament level are awesome .
nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like P@@ icul@@ ín did .
not to mention his career in the various leagues he played in .
who was the best Puerto Ric@@ an manager ?
that &apos;s a difficult one .
we had a very good team , including Julio Toro , Fl@@ or Mel@@ ende@@ z , Carlos Morales , Raymond Dal@@ m@@ au , Ar@@ mandi@@ to Torres .
of the youngsters , I really like the work of Leo Ari@@ ll .
what do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation ?
having been part of the National Team &apos;s most glorious era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90s the B@@ SN had up to 17 teams in a season .
what was there left for you to do ?
there were things I &apos;d have liked to implement , such as region@@ alising the minor leagues .
for example , the boys of P@@ once only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national play@@ offs .
right now the kids are riding and playing too much , unnecessarily .
at least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and a course for leaders , table officials and refer@@ ees .
that pleas@@ es me .
what are you doing now ?
the most I do is listen to music , watch music videos from my era on YouTube , enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games .
and of course , enjoy the company of my wife , Elizabeth , who has always been with me .
actor Larry Hag@@ man dies
Larry Hag@@ man , born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Wor@@ th ( Texas ) , became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing , better known as &quot; JR , &quot; in the television series &quot; Dallas , &quot; in which he played a ruthless , malicious and manip@@ ulative businessman .
Larry Hag@@ man , whose role as oil ty@@ coon pre@@ dator JR Ewing in the television series &quot; Dallas &quot; became a symbol of greed in the 1980s , has died .
he was 81 .
Hag@@ man , who returned this year as JR in a new season of &quot; Dallas , &quot; died on Friday afternoon of cancer complications , according to a family statement provided to the Associ@@ ated Press by the Warner Bro@@ s. , producer of &quot; Dallas . &quot;
&quot; Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas , once again representing the iconic role he most liked &quot; the family said .
Larry &apos;s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Than@@ ks@@ giving Day holiday .
Linda Gray , who played his wife in the original series and the sequel , was with Hag@@ man when he died in a hospital in Dallas , said her public@@ ist , Jeffrey Lane .
he brought joy to all who knew him .
he was creative , generous , funny , loving and talented , and I will miss him dearly .
&quot; he was an original guy and lived life to the full &quot; said Gray in a statement .
Hag@@ man was diagnosed with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years .
in 1995 a mal@@ ignant tum@@ our as found in his liver and he underwent a transplant .
years before &quot; Dallas , &quot; Hag@@ man became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy &quot; I Dream of Je@@ ann@@ ie , &quot; aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970 .
he played Captain Tony Nelson , an astr@@ on@@ aut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive genie , played by Barbara Eden , and takes her home to live with him .
he also starred in two sit@@ com@@ s that were not aired for long , &quot; The Good Life &quot; ( NBC , 1971 @-@ 72 ) and &quot; Here We Go A@@ gain &quot; ( ABC , 1973 ) .
his film work included roles well received by critics in &quot; The Group , &quot; &quot; Harry and T@@ onto &quot; and &quot; Primary Colors . &quot;
but it was his master@@ ful interpretation of delight@@ fully det@@ est@@ able JR that led to Hag@@ man reaching his peak of star@@ dom .
the drama series on CBS about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991 .
the tag@@ line &quot; Who shot JR ? , &quot; designed to generate hype around an episode full of emotions in which Hag@@ man &apos;s character is nearly killed , generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars wag@@ ered in gaming establishments .
it also helped give the series a record audience at the time .
when the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980 , an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made &quot; Dallas &quot; the second most watched entertainment programme in history , after the final episode of &quot; MAS@@ H &quot; in 1983 , which had 50 million viewers .
it was JR &apos;s sister @-@ in @-@ law Kris@@ tin ( played by Mary Cros@@ by ) who shot him .
Jr got her pregnant then threatened to say she was a pro@@ stitute unless she left town , but there were others who also had reasons to attack him .
Hag@@ man portrayed Ewing as a corrupt ins@@ ati@@ able man with a charismatic smile : a dishonest entrepreneur and cheating husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife , S@@ ue Ellen ( Linda Gray ) , sec@@ tioned .
&quot; I know what I want on JR &apos;s tom@@ bst@@ one &quot; Hag@@ man said in 1988 .
it should read : &quot; here lies the honest citizen JR Ewing . &quot;
this is the only deal he lost .
Victoria Principal , co @-@ star of the original series , recalled Hag@@ man on Friday as someone &quot; huge , on and off screen . &quot;
he is unforgettable and irreplaceable , for millions of fans around the world , and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him .
ten episodes of the new edition of &quot; Dallas &quot; were broadcast a few months ago with great success for TNT .
he had already finished recording five episodes for the second series and a sixth was in process , the chain reported .
immediately after , there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would handle the loss of Hag@@ man .
Hag@@ man , born in Fort Wor@@ th , Texas , was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin , who starred in classics such as &quot; South Pacific &quot; and &quot; Peter Pan . &quot;
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hag@@ man .
he tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early &apos; 50s , and later served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 , in England .
while there , he met the young Swedish designer Ma@@ j Ax@@ el@@ sson and married her .
the couple had two sons , Pres@@ ton and Heidi , and lived for a long time in the Califor@@ nian city Mali@@ bu , home to many celebrities .
in 2001 , he called his memo@@ irs &quot; Hello Dar@@ lin &apos; : tall ( and Absol@@ utely True ) Tales About My Life . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t put anything in it that I believed would hurt anyone or affect them in any way &quot; he told Associ@@ ated Press at the time .
after his liver transplant , he became an organ donation promoter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital , helping fearful patients .
&quot; I advise them , encourage them , meet with them when they come for their surgery , and afterwards &quot; he said in 1996 .
I try to offer some comfort , such as &quot; Don &apos;t be afraid , it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time , but then you &apos;ll be fine . &quot;
he was also an anti @-@ smoking activist and took part in several campaigns .
start of a course that explores the &quot; End of the World &quot;
each week , students explore apocalyp@@ tic themes such as nuclear war , zom@@ bies , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
this term , when Professor of religion , Stuart char@@ m@@ é , decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew he had a compelling hook : the end of the &quot; long coun@@ tdown &quot; of the Mayan calendar , 21 December , which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming .
but char@@ m@@ é had no idea what awaited him over the next couple of months : the cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ smic hurricane Sandy , a fiscal precip@@ ice some called &quot; debt Arma@@ ged@@ don &quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel , where end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ world Christians theor@@ ists think the Apo@@ calyp@@ se will begin .
&quot; I didn &apos;t realise this was going to be the most apocalyp@@ tic term ever &quot; said char@@ m@@ é this week to students at Rut@@ gers @-@ Camden University ( New Jersey ) .
if you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting , this has been a really good period .
and remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyp@@ tic mentality .
and he is not the only professor who offers courses on the &quot; end of the world &quot; this term , theoretically the last in history .
at Temple , Associate Professor Barry v@@ acker is giving the course &quot; Media , Culture and the end of the world . &quot;
each week , students explore apocalyp@@ tic themes such as nuclear war , zom@@ bies , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
&quot; we looked at why these ideas prolifer@@ ate over time &quot; he said , and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide human behaviour .
if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break out .
this month students analysed movies with an apocalyp@@ tic theme and explored how they compare with real @-@ life examples .
&quot; I &apos;ve tried to inform students about what is possible , probable , credible and impossible &quot; said v@@ acker .
at the main Pennsylvania State University campus , Latin American History Professor Matthew Rest@@ all , and his colleague Amar@@ a Sol@@ ari , an Associate Art History and Anthropo@@ logy Professor , have teamed up to give a course , called simply &quot; The end of the world . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t add &apos; 2012 &apos; so we always have the option of running the course again , if the world doesn &apos;t come to an end &quot; said Rest@@ all .
despite the &quot; impending doom , &quot; students have to study , undertake projects and take final exams .
at Penn State , the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apo@@ calyp@@ se , which leaves students no choice but to work &quot; until the very night the world is supposed to end &quot; said Rest@@ all .
the courses proved quite popular .
&quot; it was fully booked within two hours &quot; said Rest@@ all , on his course for students with high aver@@ ages , which was filled with 35 students .
we received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term , from people asking if there were any places .
students , meanwhile , say the course is one of the most interesting around .
&quot; I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves &quot; said Brid@@ gi@@ d Robinson , a 23 @-@ year @-@ old post @-@ graduate Religion and Soci@@ ology student from H@@ add@@ on@@ field , New Jersey , at Rut@@ gers @-@ Camden .
and the apocalyp@@ tic , secular or religious mentality is just a matter con@@ solation or a lack of it .
will W@@ ek@@ esa , a 25 @-@ year @-@ old post @-@ graduate Psychology and Nur@@ sing student , said he had seen all the apocalyp@@ tic movies .
&quot; I &apos;d never heard of a class that could teach it &quot; he said .
I enjoy it .
but none of the students interviewed - much less any professor - said they believed in the end date of December 21st .
&quot; our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and to a certain extent we discredited it &quot; said Julie Z@@ eg@@ len , a 21 @-@ year @-@ old final year student at Temple , from West Chester .
the May@@ ans never predicted the end of the world : it is just a key point in the calendar , said Rest@@ all .
but he said that Western culture suffers from apocalyp@@ tic anxiety , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world .
the Internet has caused a boom in these spec@@ ulations .
&quot; in other places , people don &apos;t think about it &quot; he said .
it &apos;s mostly in the English @-@ speaking world .
Joseph Dou@@ gher@@ ty , a Professor of religion at La S@@ alle University , who is giving courses in the Philippines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the &quot; end of the world &quot; there .
&quot; the Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world &quot; he wrote , suggesting an exception of a higher authority .
we have an indulgence from the Pope .
Rest@@ all noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgement , and said that if nothing happens on December 21st , &quot; people will immediately start thinking of the next date &quot; or philosoph@@ ising that December 21st is the beginning of a seven @-@ year period after which the world will end .
students and teachers are taking the date lightly .
some said they plan to go to &quot; end of the world &quot; parties .
&quot; maybe I &apos;ll call some friends so we can have a laugh together &quot; said Sam@@ ira Ford , 20 @-@ year @-@ old communications student .
Gut@@ ach : increased safety for pedestrians
they are not even 100 metres apart : on Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian lights in Dorf@@ parkplatz in Gut@@ ach became operational - within view of the existing Town Hall traffic lights .
two sets of lights so close to one another : intentional or just a silly error ?
yesterday , Gut@@ acht &apos;s Mayor gave a clear answer to this question .
&quot; at the time , the Town Hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route , &quot; explained Eck@@ ert yesterday .
the Kl@@ user lights protect cyclists , as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of Ber@@ gle .
the system , which officially became operational yesterday , is of importance to the Sul@@ z@@ bach@@ weg / Kirch@@ strasse junction .
we have the museum , two churches , the spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor &apos;s practice and a bank , not to mention the traffic from the &apos; Gru@@ b &apos; residential area .
&quot; at times of high road and pedestrian traffic , an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety , &quot; said Eck@@ ert .
this was also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Off@@ enburg District Office .
&quot; according to current measurements , around 12,000 vehicles travel through the town of Gut@@ ach on the B@@ 33 on a daily basis , of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent , &quot; emphasised Arnold .
therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary : &quot; here safety comes first , it &apos;s that simple , &quot; said Arnold .
a total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a roundabout was also considered , however , this idea was rejected on account of the narrow@@ ness of the Sul@@ z@@ bach@@ weg / Kirch@@ strasse jun@@ ctions .
according to Arnold , every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light posts : &quot; using a goods vehicle loaded with particularly long tree trun@@ ks , we also tested whether such vehicles could access the B 33 from the Sul@@ z@@ bach@@ weg without knocking over the traffic light posts . &quot;
the traffic light system itself , which cost around EUR 15,000 , is the &quot; most modern system that is currently available on the market , &quot; explained Arnold .
the system is fitted with coloured LEDs , which are bright enough that drivers can easily see the lights , even when the sun is low in the sky .
and they are also energy @-@ efficient : the older light systems consume around 100 Watts , with the new ones consuming just eight .
there are three sets of lights per direction of travel .
Arnold explained the technology used by the new system : it is fitted with two radar sensors .
if the pedestrian presses the button at the traffic lights , the top radar sensor checks the traffic status .
if the street is clear , the pedestrian obtains a green light immediately , if not , there is a delay of around 15 seconds .
an additional radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended .
&quot; if a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street , the green phase is extended , thus ensuring that everyone gets safely across the street , &quot; explained Arnold .
of course , drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the road .
yesterday this was not the case : the light had barely turned green for pedestrians when a luxury vehicle sp@@ ed through on a red light .
for more than 30 years , Josef Winkler has been writing from the heart , telling of the hard@@ ships of his childhood and youth .
the catastrophes of his Catholic village up@@ bringing - the spe@@ ech@@ lessness , his tendency towards bru@@ te force and dul@@ led sexuality , the confinement and lack of joy - all of this has been described many times by the Ka@@ ernten @-@ born poet .
the Bü@@ chner pri@@ ze@@ winner is known primarily as a writer of prose , with theatre texts something of a r@@ arity for him .
in a collage of prose texts For his performance piece , &quot; Wetter@@ leuchten auf der Zun@@ gen@@ spitze &quot; ( Summer lightning on the tip of your tongue ) , which can now be seen in Garage X on Peter@@ splatz , Gerhard Fres@@ acher , creates a collage of prose texts .
the theatre producer has thus combined elements from the autobi@@ ograph@@ ically inspired novel &quot; Der Lei@@ bei@@ gene &quot; ( 1987 ) &#91; The B@@ ond@@ sman &#93; featuring prose miniatures from &quot; Leich@@ nam , seine Familie bel@@ au@@ ernd &quot; ( 2003 ) &#91; Cor@@ p@@ se , stal@@ king his family &#93; .
on the predominantly empty stage - with one important requirement : a crum@@ pled sofa , on which cast members all@@ ude to cop@@ ulating and masturb@@ ating - the eight @-@ person ensemble work their way through the text material .
however , Director Fres@@ acher seems to have little trust in the text .
the 70 @-@ minute performance g@@ losses over the script with a host of director &apos;s additions , well @-@ known from the repertoire of post @-@ dramatic theatrical styles .
in particular , the act@@ resses play a major role in the sometimes rather dubious staging .
they are man@@ handled , their heads held under water , tack@@ ed to the wall by their evening g@@ owns .
wrapped in cell@@ oph@@ ane or in gir@@ dles , they stum@@ ble on dangerously high heels across the set , either delivering mon@@ olo@@ gues at the top of their voices or lying completely silent on the stage .
however , the source text makes barely any reference to this intense delivery .
the best moments of the evening is when the singing starts - tracks range from Deep Purple to traditional folk songs .
only towards the end does the highly charged performance start to wind down , and we see f@@ lashes of Winkler &apos;s somewhat absurd sense of humour .
a black box in your car ?
as America &apos;s road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crum@@ bling highway system , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the d@@ ashboard of your car .
the devices , which track every mile a motor@@ ist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats , are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America &apos;s major roads .
the usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spaw@@ ned intense debate and colorful alliances .
liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive , and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill .
the tea party is ag@@ hast .
the American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned , too , raising a variety of privacy issues .
and while Congress can &apos;t agree on whether to proceed , several states are not waiting .
they are exploring how , over the next decade , they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over .
thousands of motor@@ ists have already taken the black boxes , some of which have GPS monitoring , for a test drive .
this really is a must for our nation .
&quot; it is not a matter of something we might choose to do , &quot; said Has@@ an I@@ k@@ hr@@ ata , executive director of the Southern California Ass@@ n. of Governments , which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motor@@ ist by 2025 .
there is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes .
the technology is there to do it .
the push comes as the country &apos;s Highway Trust Fund , financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump , is broke .
Americans don &apos;t buy as much gas as they used to .
cars get many more miles to the gall@@ on .
the federal tax itself , 18.@@ 4 cents per gall@@ on , hasn &apos;t gone up in 20 years .
politicians are lo@@ ath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high .
&quot; the gas tax is just not sustainable , &quot; said Lee Munn@@ ich , a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota .
his state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay @-@ by @-@ mile system .
&quot; this works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he said .
won@@ ks call it a mileage @-@ based user fee .
it is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals , as the taxes could be rig@@ ged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases , for example .
California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .
but Rep@@ . Bill Shu@@ ster ( R @-@ Pa . ) , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has said he , too , sees it as the most viable long @-@ term alternative .
the free market@@ eers at the Re@@ ason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile .
&quot; this is not just a tax going into a black hole , &quot; said Adrian Moore , vice president of policy at Re@@ ason .
people are paying more directly into what they are getting .
the movement is also bol@@ stered by two former U.S. Transportation sec@@ retaries , who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay @-@ per @-@ mile direction .
the U.S. Senate approved a $ 90 @-@ million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars .
but the House leadership killed the proposal , acting on concerns of rural law@@ makers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town .
several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .
the most eager is Oregon , which is en@@ listing 5,000 drivers in the country &apos;s biggest experiment .
those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state .
Nevada has already completed a pilot .
new York City is looking into one .
Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks .
and the I @-@ 95 Coalition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Se@@ aboard ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is studying how they could go about implementing the change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in Nevada , where about 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move .
&quot; concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem , &quot; said Al@@ aud@@ din Khan , who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation .
it was not something people wanted .
as the trial got underway , the AC@@ L@@ U of Nevada warned on its website : &quot; it would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full @-@ fledged tracking devices . &quot;
there is no need to build an enormous , un@@ wiel@@ dy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals &apos; everyday comings and go@@ ings .
Nevada is among several states now scram@@ bling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .
if you can do that , Khan said , the public gets more comfortable .
the hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mil@@ eage .
the firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers .
it was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mileage .
but the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don &apos;t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information , uploaded periodically by modem .
&quot; people will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location , &quot; said Ryan Morrison , chief executive of True Mil@@ eage .
there have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs .
there are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this .
in Oregon , planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices .
they can choose a device with or without GPS .
or they can choose not to have a device at all , opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .
other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more , not less .
in New York City , transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees , provide &quot; pay @-@ as @-@ you @-@ drive &quot; insurance , and create a pool of real @-@ time speed data from other drivers that motor@@ ists could use to avoid traffic .
&quot; motor@@ ists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , &quot; says a city planning document .
some transportation planners , though , wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distra@@ ction .
at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area , officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes .
an extra one @-@ time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybri@@ ds and others whose vehicles don &apos;t use much gas , so they pay their fair share .
&quot; there is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspir@@ in , &quot; said Rand@@ y R@@ entsch@@ ler , the commission &apos;s director of legislation and public affairs .
if we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things .
Königs@@ feld : small team gives a spir@@ ited performance
the voluntary fire service bra@@ vely came through the main autumn test run in spite of a lack of personnel .
only eleven men took part in the exercise .
for the training exercise , department commander , Hans Kammer@@ er , chose the Feder premises on Burg@@ berger Strasse .
a short @-@ circuit was reported to have occurred there during sa@@ wing .
two people were injured by the resulting fire and the spread of smoke , however , one was able to make an emergency call .
two fire fighters equipped with respiratory gear prepared to enter the building following the initial inspection of the situation by Hans Kammer@@ er .
after a short time they managed to find the first person and direct them out of the building .
the second person had to be carried .
this was not so simple as they also had to negotiate a narrow stair@@ well .
the building , a workshop with integrated st@@ abling for two horses , was not easy to secure .
there were large quantities of wood and bal@@ es of straw stored inside .
in addition to this , there were also electrical machines for wood processing .
the first attempt to extingu@@ ish the fire was made using the tank on the fire engine .
another line was taken from the surface hydr@@ ant around 100 metres away .
only three attempts could be made to extingu@@ ish the bla@@ ze .
a hollow @-@ stream nozzle in the building was also used .
for Hans Kammer@@ er , the exercise was also a chance to show what can be achieved with just a few available staff .
in case of emergency , support is provided by the Königs@@ feld daytime task force .
the Commander expressed his satisfaction following the exercise .
networking between universities and companies is important
on a visit to the district of Brei@@ s@@ gau @-@ Hoch@@ schwar@@ zw@@ ald , it was explained to Parliamentary President Guido Wolf in T@@ iti@@ see @-@ Neustadt where the workforce of tomorrow will come from .
in the Hoch@@ schwar@@ zw@@ ald Support Centre , he addressed this important question alongside the executive princip@@ als of the vocational colleges and the district grammar school and the chairs of the parents &apos; council .
&quot; education is an important factor for the location , &quot; highlighted Claudia Steh@@ le , Director of the Hans Th@@ oma School , which introduced the networked Hoch@@ schwar@@ zw@@ ald Education Centre Schools Project .
during the presentation , Wolf seemed impressed by the educational pilot project .
since 2011 , there has been successful collaboration in Wäl@@ der@@ stadt between the Support Centre , the District Gramm@@ ar School and the Vocational School Complex .
he also praised the family @-@ friendly approach within the district .
&quot; it is important , not only to keep the family life stage in mind , but , on account of demographic change , the period spent providing long @-@ term care and support for relatives as well , &quot; explained Wolf .
he also stated that an increasing number of employed persons are looking after the long @-@ term care and support of relatives .
&quot; without support from their employer , the resulting burden placed on employees could result in the termination of the employment contract , &quot; said Wolf .
however , nobody can afford to lose qualified workers , &quot; he added .
another , particularly important factor is that of networking between universities and companies .
&quot; after all , people who have learned of the merits of the region during their studies often remain within the region , along with their acquired knowledge and skills , which contributes to the strengthening of the region , &quot; said the State Parliamentary President , expressing his thorough conviction .
for it is only if a sufficient number of educational places can be provided that the need for skilled workers can be covered .
in his opinion , the district &apos;s advantage as a location is its advantageous location in south @-@ west Germany , in immediate proximity to France and Switzerland .
in addition to this , on his train journey from T@@ iti@@ see @-@ Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced first @-@ hand the efforts already undertaken to develop public transport .
&quot; you must continue to be ten@@ acious and make sure that local public transport becomes even better , &quot; he explained in the address given to the local politicians in attendance .
music makes for an entertaining afternoon
it was 15 years ago that the Kau@@ l family first invited the Diet@@ ingen senior citizens for coffee and cake , followed by a snack .
previously , the elderly citizens were hosted in the service station cant@@ een .
the coffee afternoon is now held in the St. Josef nursing home .
the residents of the home were delighted with the delicious cakes and tar@@ ts .
later on , a sausage salad was provided .
Silvia k@@ im@@ mich @-@ B@@ ant@@ le and her father Karl k@@ im@@ mich entertained those in attendance with popular tunes .
the more than 100 @-@ year @-@ old natural stone wall , serving as the foremost boundary between the old school yard - which is due to be renovated - and Kirch@@ strasse , will once again feature on the renovation cost plan for the town of Brä@@ un@@ lingen .
in the days before the Kil@@ big Autumn Folk Festival , when the first renovation work was being carried out at the front of the school yard , a small corner wall with bal@@ ustra@@ des was installed to stabilise and relieve the static load on the old natural stone wall , which is more than one hundred years old .
according to Alexander Mis@@ ok of the Brä@@ un@@ lingen Municipal Planning and Building Control Authority , the ongoing procedure plans to involve the Regional Memorial Authority in the planning stage and to draw up a renovation concept for the old wall .
a cost calculation is to be performed by a team of professionals , which will then be submitted to the Town Council , which will make a decision and determine the ongoing procedure .
a decision is expected to be made in the coming year .
following the renovation , pl@@ ast@@ ering and planting of trees in the old internal school yard , within the two wings of the 1912 school , as a subsequent measure the boundary wall , which is in need of refurbishment , must be renovated from the ground up within the foreseeable future .
the historic , one hundred @-@ year @-@ old boundary wall between the old school @-@ yard and Kirch@@ strasse is in need of renovation , primarily as a result of water and frost damage , on account of the lack of drainage , and is leaning forwards .
deep cracks in a number of individual stones testify to the weather damage , however , at present the wall is not in danger of collapse .
a secure wall is essential for a school yard that is used by pupils , and this is the purpose of the current fortification work .
the school yard renovation was originally planned back in 2008 / 2009 , however , high un@@ planned expenses meant that the work had to be pushed back .
the Regional Memorial Authority will have a major say in the historic school wall renovation , which has even been used for filming .
if this authority were to impose requirements , then the town of Brä@@ un@@ lingen would hope to receive subsidies from the monument preserv@@ ation@@ ists .
the pupils of the Brä@@ un@@ lingen Primary School , who are now being taught in a well renovated old school building , with a new hall , will soon be able to use the old school yard as well .
Ö@@ z@@ de@@ mir wants jazz training in Stuttgart
C@@ em Ö@@ z@@ de@@ mir , Federal Chairman of the Green Party , has now engaged in the ongoing discussions regarding the future of the Baden @-@ Wuer@@ ttemberg Music Academy .
&quot; I do not think it is right to abandon comprehensive training in the Stuttgart Music College , &quot; said Ö@@ z@@ de@@ mir , speaking to the &quot; Stuttgarter Nachrichten . &quot;
jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location of Stuttgart .
as such , Ö@@ z@@ de@@ mir , who is the favourite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the parliamentary elections on 22 September , is in disagreement with the Green @-@ Red State Government .
on the basis of an expert study , this government is urging the reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden @-@ Wuer@@ ttemberg .
in accordance with these plans , the jazz and pop courses , among others , are to be relocated from the Stuttgart Music College to the Mannheim Music College .
us borders : &quot; super tunnel &quot; for drug smuggling discovered
on the border between Mexico and the USA , investigators have discovered and shut down a &quot; super tunnel &quot; intended for drug smuggling .
as announced by the US Customs Authorities , the pipe between Ti@@ juana and San Diego , measuring more than 500 metres in length , was equipped with electricity , a railway track and a ventilation system .
three suspects were detained in relation to the discovery , with eight tonnes of mari@@ juana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .
according to the details provided , the tunnel had not yet been put into use .
&quot; these cartels are stupid if they think that they can dig through under the radar , &quot; said the US Attorney for the District of Southern California , Laura Diff@@ y , at a press conference held in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where the end of the tunnel was discovered .
referring to the drug gangs , Du@@ ffy assured : &quot; if you continue to build and attempt to use these tunnels , we are determined to make this a big waste of your dirty money . &quot;
both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in an ongoing battle against the drug cartels .
since 2006 , more than 77@@ ,000 people have been killed in conjunction with drug crime in Mexico .
built by experts
due to the elaborate configuration of the tunnel , investigators are working on the assumption that it was build by architects and engineers and that the construction took around one year .
the railway system was equipped in such a way that electrically powered car@@ ts could be used on it .
on the Mexican side , the entrance is located in a building located 80 metres from the border .
according to the authorities , a ladder runs 20 metres underground to the actual entrance of the tunnel .
the tunnel has a cross @-@ section measuring 1.@@ 20 metres high and 90 cen@@ timet@@ res across .
it would thus be suitable to assist illegal immigration into the USA .
two of the suspects were detained in conjunction with the cocaine find .
the third , a Mexican , was detained due to the seizure of the mari@@ juana .
all three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment , according to the authorities .
since 2006 , eight tunnels of this type have been discovered , the press conference in San Diego continued .
however , this was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction .
normally cocaine is smug@@ gled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .
this shows the &quot; desperation &quot; of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said Bill Sher@@ man of the D@@ EA Drug Squ@@ ad in San Diego .
they will do anything to make it to the USA .
no specific details were given regarding those detained , but it is reported that at least one is Mexican
they can expect prison terms of up to ten years .
2014 is to be a year of celebration in Gei@@ singen
the anniversary celebrations in the town of Gei@@ singen , to mark the 1,@@ 250@@ th
anniversary of the first documented mention of the town , are drawing closer .
when the year comes to an end in just eight weeks , the anniversary year will be upon us .
Gei@@ singen and Kirchen @-@ Hau@@ sen were first documented together in the year 7@@ 94 .
a deed was drafted in Kirchen , in which both towns are mentioned .
on 15 March , the anniversary year will be officially launched , and because Gei@@ singen currently has no suitable venues , this launch event will take place in the location where the two towns were first documented 1,@@ 250 years ago , in Kirchen @-@ Hau@@ sen .
as part of the anniversary celebrations , a number of events are planned both in Gei@@ singen and Kirchen @-@ Hau@@ sen .
Kirchen @-@ Hau@@ sen will celebrate the 1,@@ 250@@ th anniversary with a celeb@@ ratory weekend from 18 to 20
July .
on the Friday there will be a ceremony , and on the Saturday and Sunday a party will be held at the Kirch@@ tal@@ halle .
the Kirchen @-@ Hau@@ sen Kirchen@@ fest festival will also be held on this celeb@@ ratory weekend .
town Musical Director , Rudolf Barth , has composed a commissioned piece for the town on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed on three dates .
on 21 June , in conjunction with the Schwarzw@@ al@@ d@@ verein &#91; Black Forest Association &#93; Mid @-@ Summer Festival , on 12 July in the Arena , accompanied by fireworks , and on 13 December as the first concert put on by the Stadt@@ musik ( Town Musical Society ) in the new Festival Hall .
this venue will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , with the official date set for the last weekend in September , on 27 and 28 September .
on the occasion of the Gei@@ singen town anniversary , a new chron@@ icle will also be published .
&quot; however , it will not merely be a chron@@ icle of Gei@@ singen itself , but rather a printed work on the Gei@@ singen of today , which now consists of Gei@@ singen , Kirchen @-@ Hau@@ sen , Leip@@ fer@@ dingen , A@@ ul@@ fingen and Gut@@ mad@@ ingen , &quot; said Mayor Walter Heng@@ stler .
and the Gei@@ singen of today is also celebrating a birthday in 2014 , as it was in 1974 that the incorpor@@ ations to form the current region were completed .
the new chron@@ icle is to be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festival Hall in Gei@@ singen .
however , 2014 is also a year of many anni@@ versaries in other respects .
the Nar@@ ren@@ zun@@ ft Stroh@@ gl@@ on@@ ki ( Stroh@@ gl@@ on@@ ki F@@ ool &apos;s Guild celebration ) begins on 8 February with an evening of traditional customs on the occasion of its 60 @-@ year anniversary / The Harmonie Gut@@ mad@@ ingen music association will turn 90 years old and on 29 March will hold a celeb@@ ratory banquet and then from 1 to 4 May will be celebrating the Bezirks@@ fest &#91; District Music Festival &#93; .
the Leip@@ fer@@ dingen Nur@@ sing Home will turn 40 years old , the Gei@@ singen School has now been at its new location for 50 years and will be celebrating this on 10 May , and the Poly@@ hym@@ nia Leip@@ fer@@ dingen music association will turn 150 years old and will be celebrating this as part of the Brun@@ nen@@ fest &#91; Fountain Festival &#93; from 4 to 7 July .
the town of Gei@@ singen was first officially documented in the year 7@@ 64 , in a deed of donation , which is now in the possession of the St. Gallen Monastery .
the deed was drawn up in Kirchen ( Hau@@ sen ) , which at the time was the location of the cour@@ thouse .
both communities are thus mentioned in the same deed .
one reason for choosing 2014 to celebrate the 1,@@ 250 @-@ year anniversary in this way , is that it also coincides with the 40th anniversary of the Community Reform ( Gemeinder@@ e@@ form ) .
Council sets its sights on rail system
should the &quot; Am Hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing be reconstructed at great cost , in order to increase traffic safety ?
the Town Councils have decided that the answer is yes .
Schil@@ t@@ ach will have to contribute up to EUR 2@@ 20,000 to the project .
the Deutsche Bahn hopes to improve the Kin@@ zig@@ tal railway line in the coming year .
in particular , safety at railway crossings is to be increased - collisions between trains and other vehicles frequently occur at these across the country .
if the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures , they will be required to contribute one third of the costs , with the remainder divided between Deutsche Bahn and the Federal Government .
Schil@@ t@@ ach &apos;s town master mas@@ on , Roland Gri@@ e@@ ß@@ haber , explained the peculiarities of the &quot; Am Hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing to the Town Council .
at the crossing , the town is planning to increase the height of the mouth of the tunnel to the west of the railway line .
larger vehicles , for example those that transport long logs , would be able to wait there in the event of on@@ coming traffic , without having to block the railway line .
Gri@@ e@@ ß@@ haber therefore suggested that a required supporting wall be constructed in such a way that the town could in due course widen the adjoining street in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic .
this was the subject of controversial discussion in the Town Council , as some council members cast doubt over the need to widen the road : Thomas K@@ ip@@ p summarised the perspective of the critics with this statement : &quot; do we have to hand over so much money on account of so few vehicles ? &quot;
Mayor Thomas Haas re@@ tor@@ ted : the &quot; Hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing is used regularly for the transportation of long logs .
even wood from the &quot; Kuh@@ bach &quot; area is occasionally transported via this route , as the vehicles , which measure 20 metres in length , would not be able to use the route via the Hä@@ ber@@ les Bridge , as they would not be able to make the turn on the Hauptstrasse .
furthermore , when the Hauptstrasse is blocked , the route would also serve as a bypass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel , argued Haas .
given that it is likely that the Kirch@@ berg and Schloss@@ berg tunnel will have to be reconstructed and renovated , as is currently the case in Wol@@ fach , the &quot; Am Hir@@ schen &quot; railway crossing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time .
the councill@@ ors agreed to have an investigation conducted as to what costs the planned widening of the road would incur .
nevertheless , the reconstruction of the railway crossing was cons@@ ented to by a majority , on the provision that the required supporting wall be built in such a way that the town could , if required , extend the connecting road in the &quot; Bahnhof@@ straße &quot; direction to around 5.5 metres to accommodate on@@ coming traffic .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trau@@ twein tann@@ ery could , on the other hand , bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the steep &quot; Ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ häuser Weg . &quot;
the Administrative Department had Deutsche Bahn &apos;s reconstruction plans investigated by the Bre@@ in@@ linger Engineering Office , as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ häuser Weg will be straightforward .
the investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming stuck .
the town , as the authority responsible for road construction , would then bear responsibility for this .
the reconstruction could therefore result in liability disputes .
because both the transportation of wood and turning are both possible as things are , the reconstruction of the railway crossing should not be cons@@ ented to , argued Haas .
at this point , the risk of a train collision with a vehicle positioned on the crossing is considerably lower than at other railway crossings , on account of the fact that there is a mid@@ point from which there is a good line of sight , directly alongside the stopping point .
the trains themselves , coming from the central station , must also be sufficiently slowed down so that there is no threat of collision .
according to the councill@@ ors , the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority , as the town of Schil@@ t@@ ach would &quot; bear the brunt of the cost &quot; for the problem of vehicles becoming stuck , since the Deutsche Bahn would be able to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work .
the committee considers the reconstruction of the &quot; Vor Heu@@ bach &quot; and &apos; Vor Kuh@@ bach &quot; railway crossings , for which the crossing agreements have already been reached with Deutsche Bahn , to be un@@ problematic .
ESA makes decision on major space missions : missions costing billions
distant planets , gravit@@ ational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years .
there were 30 proposals to choose from , five of which are still in the running .
distant worlds .
astronomers have already found more than 1,000 planets near other stars .
whether or not life exists on at least some of these , no @-@ one knows .
the choice is a difficult one : should we search for gravit@@ ational waves ?
or instead conduct research into the origin of the cosmos ?
or search for planets similar to the Earth and thus perhaps discover extrater@@ restrial life ?
these are the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the European Space Agency , ESA .
for their &quot; Co@@ smic Vision &quot; programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which should greatly advance research .
the budget for &quot; L @-@ Mis@@ sions &quot; such as this lies at around one billion Euro .
the projects are planned to start in 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
at the beginning of September , the elite in the field of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were up for debate , of which five have now made it onto the short list .
numerous panels are assessing the proposals , posing questions to the researchers .
over the coming days , a final decision is to be made by the Scientific Programme Committee .
in total , four main questions were chosen by the ESA , to which the missions of the &quot; Co@@ smic Vision &quot; programme , initiated in 2007 , are to find the answers .
what are the conditions required for the formation of planets and life ?
the precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of the planets that orbit these stars - lie in pro@@ ver@@ bial darkness .
a large infr@@ a @-@ red telescope in space could penetrate this darkness .
and if a star has planets , under what circumstances can life exist there ?
in order to pursue this question , the &quot; Che@@ ops &quot; space telescope is to be launched in 2017 , with which 500 known planetary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail .
the possibilities are , however , limited - Che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million Euro .
with larger instruments , astronomers could map planets similar to Earth and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres , and thus search for &quot; biom@@ ark@@ ers &quot; : gases that serve as an indicator for biological activity .
how does the solar system function ?
this question should also provide information regarding the preconditions for the origins of life .
the magnetic activity of a star , the interaction of its magnetic field and the emitted particle radiation play an important role .
it is possible to investigate these processes in our solar system , to serve as an example to be applied elsewhere .
with the &quot; Solar Or@@ bit@@ er , &quot; the ESA has already approved an M @-@ class mission ( for which the budget stands at around half a million Euro ) to address this matter .
the probe is to be launched in 2017 and will closely observe the surface and activity of the sun .
Jupiter and its mo@@ ons are also of great interest to the researchers .
they want to find our what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system .
the ESA is planning that the first of the total of three L @-@ Mis@@ sions of the &quot; Co@@ smic Vision &quot; programme will address this subject .
the &quot; Ju@@ ice &quot; ( Jupiter I@@ cy Mo@@ ons Explorer ) probe is planned to begin its journey in 20@@ 22 .
eight years later it will reach Jupiter and will investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy mo@@ ons Europa , Cal@@ list@@ o and G@@ any@@ me@@ de .
what are the basic physical laws of the Universe ?
outer space offers many possibilities for studying substances under extreme conditions and thus examining whether the laws of nature , as known to us , are still valid there .
there may also be deviations that could show physicians the path to a new theory , under the umbrella of which all known natural laws could be united .
how did the universe come about and what does it consist of ?
13.@@ 7 billion years ago , our cosmos was created by the Big Bang .
alongside the materials familiar to us , from which stars , planets and life forms such as ourselves are composed , there exists dark matter , the gravit@@ ational force of which holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and dark energy , the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe .
thus far , researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the Big Bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .
with &quot; Eu@@ cli@@ d , &quot; the ESA has already approved an M @-@ mission , planned to commence in 2020 .
with a special telescope , the probe is to examine the distribution of material in the universe across the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy .
proposals that are in the running ...
of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .
the proposal with the best chance of approval as an L @-@ mission , in the opinion of many experts , is &quot; E @-@ Lisa , &quot; a demanding concept that aims to prove the existence of gravit@@ ational waves .
many physicians perceive this to entail changes in the structure of space @-@ time , which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .
to date they have never been proved to exist .
the scientists behind the project hope that Elisa could achieve this .
the mission involves placing a detector , consisting of two or three probes , in outer space .
unlike systems on Earth , it could also prove gravit@@ ational waves created during the Big Bang , and thus provide fresh knowledge regarding the origin of the cosmos .
four other proposals are still competing for the second L @-@ mission place : a large X @-@ ray telescope called &quot; Ath@@ ena , &quot; which among other things would research black holes , &quot; I@@ cy Plan@@ ets , &quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , &quot; pris@@ m , &quot; a mission for the measurement of cosmic background radiation , and the &quot; Ex@@ op@@ lan@@ et Finder , &quot; which would find and investigate planets similar to Earth .
among others , proposals that have already been ruled out include proposals for bringing samples back from Mars , conducting research on the moon , Venus and astero@@ ids , as well as proposals in the area of solar physics .
Snow@@ den ready to &quot; cooperate &quot; with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snow@@ den , the US intelligence whist@@ leb@@ lower , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities .
German MP Hans @-@ Christian Strö@@ bel@@ e on Thursday met Mr Snow@@ den in Russia , where he has been granted asylum , to discuss him testi@@ fying in Germany .
a letter from Mr Snow@@ den , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP , said : &quot; though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as def@@ ection , and seeks to crimin@@ alise political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no defence . &quot;
however , speaking the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , Mr Snow@@ den said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him .
the charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property .
Hans @-@ Peter Friedrich , German interior minister , told Zeit Online : &quot; if Mr Snow@@ den is ready to speak to German officials , we will find ways to make this possible . &quot;
relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the N@@ SA bu@@ gged Chancellor Angela &apos;s Merkel &apos;s phone .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that over@@ sees intelligence , said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snow@@ den as a witness &quot; without bringing him into danger and completely ru@@ ining relations with the US , &quot; it should be taken .
Mr Strö@@ bel@@ e , an MP for Germany &apos;s Green party , published a picture of himself with Mr Snow@@ den on his Twitter feed .
he was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists .
Mr Strö@@ bel@@ e said that , according to the former N@@ SA contractor &apos;s lawyer , Mr Snow@@ den would not be able to return to Russia if he left .
if Mr Snow@@ den testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be &quot; safe &quot; there , the MP said .
Mr Snow@@ den said in his letter that he had faced a &quot; severe and sustained &quot; campaign of persecution that forced him from his home .
however he said that he was hear@@ tened by the worldwide response to &quot; my act of political expression . &quot;
citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an un@@ accountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service .
the letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities &quot; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved . &quot;
frontier Airlines to charge for carry @-@ on baggage
frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 for passengers to store carry @-@ on luggage on board their flight .
frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for a carry @-@ on bag and $ 2 for coffee or so@@ da , although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can .
the new carry @-@ on fee is for bags in the overhead bin , so small bags under the seat will still be free .
frontier said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , $ 100 if travelers wait to pay until they &apos;re at the gate .
frontier spokes@@ woman Kate O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said the $ 100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to charge that , &quot; she said .
airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008 .
passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuff@@ ing as much as they can into carry @-@ on baggage st@@ ashed in overhead bins , meaning those bins often run out of space .
fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board .
o &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said the new charge is not really about raising money .
it &apos;s about Frontier &apos;s most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult .
passengers who buy their tickets on the airline &apos;s website won &apos;t have to pay .
that means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free , while the next person in line might owe $ 100 for a similar bag .
o &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said Frontier &apos;s website and check @-@ in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate .
frontier &apos;s new carry @-@ on fee won &apos;t start until summer , though a date hasn &apos;t been set .
passengers often g@@ rum@@ ble about baggage charges and other fees , but airlines love them .
they argue that luggage costs money to handle , and passengers who want the service should pay for it .
many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most haven &apos;t touched carry @-@ on bag fees , though .
spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry @-@ on fee three years ago , and fellow dis@@ counter Al@@ legi@@ ant Air later followed .
the only other airline with such a fee is Hungary &apos;s Wiz@@ z Air , said airline consultant Jay Sor@@ en@@ sen , who closely tracks add @-@ on fees .
he estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit &apos;s carry @-@ on fee brings in $ 50 million a year .
Sor@@ en@@ sen , a former executive with Mid@@ west Airlines , flew Spirit recently and wondered what he &apos;d find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit &apos;s unusual carry @-@ on bag fee .
&quot; the boarding process was the smooth@@ est I had seen in my airline career , &quot; he said .
I was expecting to see gn@@ ashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate .
the plane was full , he said , &quot; and it boar@@ ded lick@@ ety @-@ split . &quot;
frontier is also following Spirit &apos;s $ 2 charge for coffee , tea , so@@ da , or juice .
frontier said passengers who get so@@ da or juice can keep the whole can , and it will give coffee ref@@ ills for free .
it will still give away water .
us Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed .
frontier &apos;s move to charge the carry @-@ on fee if passengers don &apos;t buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website .
airlines pay online travel sellers such as Or@@ bit@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
that has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency .
frontier has gone the furthest in this area , though .
in September it began giving half as many frequent f@@ lier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency .
on Wednesday it s@@ lashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip .
so , a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles .
it also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website .
frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver , but its business is shrinking and losing money .
revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shr@@ ank almost 13 percent in the first quarter , according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc .
Republic has been trying to fix Frontier &apos;s finances as part of selling the airline .
say@@ ings come from the Bible
at least 40 women attended the last women &apos;s breakfast of the year , in the Evangel@@ ical Parish of Bis@@ ingen .
the theme of the day in the parish hall was &quot; Say@@ ings from the Bible &quot; and &quot; Expres@@ sions from the Middle Ages . &quot;
Z@@ ita Köhler , the Chair@@ person of the Parish Council , agreed to give a talk on Bi@@ blical pro@@ verbs after breakfast .
&quot; pro@@ verbs contain pearls of wisdom , commandments or warnings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several German say@@ ings with the corresponding Bible verses and explained the meaning .
she referred to say@@ ings such as : &quot; Holz@@ au@@ ge sei wachsam &quot; ( keep your eyes pe@@ eled ) , &quot; wie Schu@@ ppen von den Augen fallen &quot; ( like scales falling from one &apos;s eyes ) , &quot; ein Auge auf jemand werfen &quot; ( to cast an eye on someone ) , &quot; den S@@ einen gibt &apos;s der Herr im Schlaf &quot; ( good things come to some when they sleep ) and &quot; seine Hände in Unschuld waschen &quot; ( to wash one &apos;s hands of something ) .
on several occasions , the speaker asked those listening to guess what proverb they were based on .
expressions from the Middle Ages were addressed by Parish Coun@@ cill@@ or Christ@@ el Deh@@ ner : &quot; aller guten Dinge sind drei &quot; ( All good things come in thre@@ es ) , &quot; blau machen &quot; ( to skip school / work ) , &quot; etwas verh@@ auen &quot; ( to wall@@ op something ) .
she explained the meaning and origin of the expressions , which she referred to as &quot; bridges to the past . &quot;
to round off the morning there was a tom@@ bola .
the prizes were placed , covered , on a table and were humor@@ ously parap@@ hr@@ ased prior to being presented to the winners .
may@@ oral candidate Roman Wai@@ zen@@ egger was also to be found among the visitors to the joint breakfast .
learning rather than unemployment : tourism pilot project for the un@@ trained
a pilot project for the tourist industry is being launched today in the Mecklenburg lake district .
under the management of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 men and women who are already working within the industry as un@@ trained workers , will be trained as qualified hotel and restaurant staff over the course of three winters .
&quot; what &apos;s innovative about it is that the six @-@ month courses end with diplomas , &quot; said Carmen Wi@@ ech@@ ert of the Neu@@ brand@@ enburg Employment Agency .
there are many benefits : the participants will not be unemployed , the companies receive trained skilled workers , which are in continually increasing demand in hotels and restaurants , and the agency will not have to fund unemployment .
also involved in the project are the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststätte , DE@@ HO@@ GA ) of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pomer@@ ania .
N@@ SA bl@@ ames &quot; Internal Error , &quot; Not Hack@@ ers , For Website Crash
the sha@@ dow@@ y National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glit@@ ch that brought down its public website for a few hours , not hackers as some claimed online .
&quot; N@@ S@@ A.@@ gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update , &quot; the spy agency said in an em@@ ailed statement .
the issue will be resolved this evening .
claims that the ou@@ tage was caused by a distributed denial of service &#91; D@@ Do@@ S &#93; attack are not true .
earlier this evening online server tra@@ ckers noted the N@@ SA &apos;s website had been down for at least six hours , and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users .
earlier an N@@ SA spokesperson told ABC News the agency &apos;s internal , sensitive network was &quot; not at all &quot; compromised .
no classified information is in danger , the spokesperson said .
at least one hack@@ tiv@@ ist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the N@@ SA site with a D@@ Do@@ S attack .
D@@ Do@@ S attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .
the cyber tactic is a relatively uns@@ oph@@ istic@@ ated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system .
the formerly super secre@@ tive N@@ SA , once nick@@ named No Such Agency , has found itself in very public light , and amid vicious criticism , in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret N@@ SA files stolen from the agency and leaked by dis@@ enchanted former N@@ SA contractor Edward Snow@@ den .
such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight &apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation .
in October , the number of job@@ less fell slightly by 22 , to a total of 1,@@ 307 .
the rate of 3.1 per cent is indeed better than the previous year and is also better than in September , &quot; however , we had hoped for more , &quot; said Monika Felder @-@ Bauer , acting branch manager of the Employment Agency in Son@@ tho@@ fen .
several companies have thus far reacted cautiously when it comes to hiring .
stating a reason for this , Felder @-@ Bauer said : &quot; we have barely any skilled workers in the fields of skilled crafts and trades , healthcare and ger@@ iat@@ ric care . &quot;
seasonal job offers for staff in hotel and restaurant businesses have been coming in since September .
the Winter season within the industry begins in mid @-@ December .

Bombardier profit di@@ ps as plane deliveries , orders fall
Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday , pressur@@ ed by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit .
Montreal @-@ based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand @-@ new C@@ Series aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September .
after the test plane &apos;s inaugural flight about a month and a half ago , it has only flown three more times , raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track .
results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .
Cameron Do@@ erk@@ sen , an analyst with National Bank Financial , lowered his rating to &quot; sector perform &quot; from &quot; out@@ perform &quot; on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters .
&quot; while the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated , we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation , &quot; Do@@ erk@@ sen said in a client note .
we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the C@@ Series as the flight test program progresses .
however , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program .
Bombardier hopes the C@@ Series aircraft family can cat@@ ap@@ ult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus .
the first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays .
but firm orders for the C@@ Series are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company &apos;s claims about the new jet@@ liner &apos;s fuel efficiency and cost savings potential .
there are currently 4@@ 03 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators .
chief Executive Officer Pierre Beau@@ do@@ in was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use .
executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule .
&quot; the test plane didn &apos;t stay on the ground longer than anticipated , &quot; Beau@@ do@@ in said in a conference call , adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane &apos;s downtime .
every manufacturer schedules it in a different way .
we had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that &apos;s what we have done .
that will happen all through the flight program .
the second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks , with the remainder following shortly after , the company said .
still , analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a C@@ Series plane 12 months after its maiden flight .
Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry @-@ into @-@ service ( E@@ IS ) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months .
&quot; this slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier &apos;s internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry @-@ into @-@ service will be pushed to Q1 / 15 , &quot; said Do@@ erk@@ sen .
for the third quarter ended September 30 , Bombardier &apos;s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share a year earlier .
adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents .
revenue di@@ pped margin@@ ally to $ 4.1 billion from $ 4.2 billion .
analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $ 4.@@ 56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
the world &apos;s fourth @-@ largest plan@@ emaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter , down from 57 a year earlier .
net orders fell to 26 aircraft , from 83 .
the backlog in the aerospace division was $ 3@@ 2.9 billion as of September 30 , unchanged from December 31 .
&quot; in aerospace , results were in line with our guidance , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment , &quot; Beau@@ do@@ in said .
aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
Bombardier , the world &apos;s largest train@@ maker , said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
the order backlog in the transportation unit was $ 3@@ 2.6 billion as of September 30 , up margin@@ ally from December 31 .
the transportation division &apos;s margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts .
executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter .
shares of Bombardier , which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pich@@ ette would join the board , were down 8.5 percent at C $ 4.@@ 83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday .
Brazil &apos;s Emb@@ ra@@ er SA , the world &apos;s third @-@ largest commercial plan@@ emaker and Bombardier &apos;s closest rival , reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday .
USA : shots fired at Los Angeles Airport

cocaine @-@ ad@@ dict lawyer who ti@@ pped off Mr Big about police investigation is j@@ ailed
Bas@@ har@@ at D@@ itta , 42 , would feed information to crime lord Neil Scar@@ b@@ rough
the solic@@ itor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed
was given a three @-@ year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court
a top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation , because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed , has been j@@ ailed for three years .
Bas@@ har@@ at D@@ itta , 42 , would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scar@@ b@@ rough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit .
the solic@@ itor , who was nick@@ named &quot; Bash &quot; and hailed by criminals as a &quot; top brief , &quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scar@@ borough , who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial .
officers spotted Sar@@ borough , 32 , dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer &apos;s home in Black@@ burn , Lan@@ cas@@ hire , while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues .
inquiries revealed D@@ itta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , on his wallet and on his credit cards .
over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to il@@ lic@@ itly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scar@@ borough as well as one of his associates .
all four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine ra@@ cket operating across Lan@@ cas@@ hire , Cum@@ bri@@ a , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , Ber@@ kshire and West Yorkshire .
they and 32 other men were later j@@ ailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5@@ million along with more than £ 200,000 in cash during a series of raids .
dit@@ ta , 42 , fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed
today at Liverpool Crown Court D@@ itta , who works at law firm For@@ bes So@@ lic@@ itors , based in Black@@ burn , was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perver@@ ting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court .
he admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing .
the lawyer &apos;s down@@ fall came after police investigating Scar@@ borough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with D@@ itta in February 2011 .
two det@@ ectives tra@@ iled the suspect and spotted him arriving at D@@ itta &apos;s house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer &apos;s bins in a black golf glove .
soon after the drop off , Scar@@ borough was in regular phone contact with D@@ itta who had been out at the dinner at the Black@@ burn Ro@@ vers football stadium , E@@ wood Park .
the lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them .
the court heard D@@ itta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair , wallet and on his credit cards
dit@@ ta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to &quot; legal privilege . &quot;
during his arrest D@@ itta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken f@@ om him .
in a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business .
but the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain , some of whom he had previously represented , after key arrests to tell them what det@@ ectives knew about them .
prosecuting , Anne W@@ hy@@ te said : &quot; if anyone should know not to the break the law , it is a criminal solic@@ itor . &quot;
Mr D@@ itta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solic@@ itor , having become too involved with specific clients .
the relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs .
some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer .
but this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer @-@ client relationship .
he thwar@@ ted the police &apos;s investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities .
Mr D@@ itta was not honouring his profession , but dishon@@ ouring it .
he got too close to certain clients , in particular Scar@@ borough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .
dit@@ ta denied wrong@@ doing and claimed : &quot; if I was a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scar@@ borough , I would not wait 15 hours , I would do it immediately . &quot;
but after the hearing sup@@ t Lee Hal@@ stead from Lan@@ cas@@ hire Police said : &quot; Mr D@@ itta turned from criminal solic@@ itor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals . &quot;
his addiction to cocaine left him hop@@ elessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations .
solic@@ itors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should in@@ stil trust and confidence in the public .
Mr D@@ itta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession .
Lan@@ cas@@ hire &apos;s Seri@@ ous and Organ@@ ised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr D@@ itta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perver@@ ting the course of justice , demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice .
let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law .
we will find you and put you before the courts .
Scar@@ borough himself was j@@ ailed for 14 years after ple@@ ading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin , cocaine and cannabis .
thirty five other men involved in the ra@@ cket were j@@ ailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences .
on his website D@@ itta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Ro@@ w in America , his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work .
revolutionary Sacred Music Factory
to close the celebrations on the occasion of its 160@@ th anniversary , the Lieder@@ kran@@ z D@@ unn@@ ingen ( D@@ unn@@ ingen Amateur Choir , or gle@@ e Club , if you like ) will perform Franz Schubert &apos;s &quot; Deutsche Messe &quot; ( German Mass ) to accompany two church services .
following the great success of the musical , &quot; Rock my Life , &quot; which enth@@ used audiences this past Spring , the Lieder@@ kran@@ z will bless two church services with the performance of Franz Schubert &apos;s Deutsche Messe , to close its anniversary year celebrations .
on Saturday 26 October , this exceptional mass will be heard from 7.00 p.m. during the evening mass in the St. Marin@@ us@@ kirche D@@ unn@@ ingen and on Sunday 27 October , from 10.@@ 15 , at the service in the St. Johannes Bapti@@ st@@ kirche in Lack@@ endorf .
the so @-@ called &apos; German Mass &apos; , with the original title &quot; Ges@@ änge zur Feier des hei@@ liges Opfers der Messe &quot; ( Songs to celebrate the holy sacrifice of the mass ) , D 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual work by composer Franz Schubert , dating from 18@@ 26 , at at the time it was written was considered almost revolutionary .
patron Johan Philipp Neumann has in mind for the mass to be performed as part of the church services .
under the direc@@ tor@@ ship of Hermann Schneider , the choir will be accompanied by the wind ensemble of the Fro@@ h@@ sinn Tenn@@ en@@ bronn Music Society , and by No@@ emi Lok@@ o@@ di on the organ .
Has@@ lach : scepticism visibly gives way to confidence
the 2015 Parish Council elections will bring about fundamental change , for example in the Has@@ lach Past@@ oral Care Unit ( Seel@@ sorge@@ einheit Has@@ lach , SE ) .
there will then only be one joint Parish Council for all six par@@ ishes .
in a joint meeting on Saturday , the committees from Has@@ lach , Hof@@ st@@ etten , Müh@@ len@@ bach , Fischer@@ bach , Stein@@ ach and Wel@@ schen@@ stein@@ ach prepared for the changes .
this is because there are no further changes to be made to the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the Parish Councils to implement these in as satisfactory a manner possible .
during the course of the day one thing became particularly clear : the scepticism towards the new system is reluctantly yet visibly giving way to confidence .
the extremely constructive discussions between the six committees and the full @-@ time members of the pastoral care team addressed topics ranging from perceptions and expectations regarding the 2015 reforms , to concrete proposals regarding the future composition and size of the Parish Council .
regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly drawn @-@ up guidelines for pastoral care units in the arch @-@ diocese of Freiburg with the help of a presentation .
according to the guidelines , the SE Has@@ lach , as a church community , will be a corporation under public law , which shall assume the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities .
there will then only be one joint Parish Council and a Foundation Council , in which the rector will be represented by virtue of his office .
from each parish , at least two elected members are to be represented , with so @-@ called church community teams set up on @-@ site in the six par@@ ishes .
in future their task will be to promote church life on a local basis .
regarding the issue of the finances of the individual par@@ ishes , the need for extensive discussion became evident .
the reforms plan for the accumulated assets in the par@@ ishes to be retained for a specified purpose .
accounts payable , on the other hand , will be passed over to the &quot; church community &quot; as a whole .
in particular , planned major investments , the debts from which thus affect all par@@ ishes , were cause for great concern .
&quot; in the past , investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual par@@ ishes by themselves , &quot; said Has@@ lach &apos;s Parish Council Chairman Bruno Prinz@@ bach .
Bar@@ bar Ritter , Chair of the Committee in the Sch@@ utter@@ wald @-@ Neur@@ ied pastoral care unit , has practical experience of a joint committee for five par@@ ishes .
in 2006 she set herself the task , &quot; Bec@@ ome one , remain five &quot; and came to realise that the task is really not that simple .
the Committees of the Has@@ lach pastoral care unit set out to answer questions regarding the future composition and size of the joint Parish Council , and the practical work of the church community teams .
the specific details will be confirmed in subsequent meetings and decided in an additional joint meeting of all six committees in the coming spring .
at the end , Parish Co@@ uns@@ ellor Michael Schön@@ er from Stein@@ ach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit , which was agreed on by a clear majority .
electricity to become more expensive in P@@ full@@ endorf
the citizens of P@@ full@@ endorf will have to adjust to high electricity costs .
as Managing Director of the municipal energy company , Jörg @-@ Ar@@ ne Bi@@ as , confirmed to the S@@ Ü@@ D@@ KUR@@ IER , families of four in P@@ full@@ endorf will be on the receiving end of a price increase of EUR 70 to 90 per year .
one major reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise of the so @-@ called EEC Lev@@ y from 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.3 C@@ ents per kil@@ owatt hour .
this levy will be reset by the four operators of the large power grids , in October of each year .
they estimate the additional costs they will incur as a result of the &quot; energy turnaround , &quot; which they will be able to recover by means of a levy on the price of electricity .
the P@@ full@@ endorf municipal energy company forms the last link in this chain .
in its projections , the supervisory council of the energy company even assumed a levy higher than that reported by Jörg @-@ Ar@@ ne Bi@@ as .
the specific figures must now be calculated before the municipal energy c@@ mp@@ any can inform its customers of the precise price increase next week .
&quot; we are working on the assumption of an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; said Bi@@ as , with the figure likely to be closer to 2 cents .
traffic lights permanently red : observe waiting time
sometimes a traffic light simply never turns green .
the contact loop on the road does not react , or the light itself is defective .
what should you do - drive through on red ?
if an affected person has waited for a sufficiently long period of time at a red light , and provided the crossing is clear , they can drive on , explained Stuttgart @-@ based lawyer Ralf Becker in &quot; Motorrad &quot; ( Motor@@ cycle ) magazine .
the waiting time must , however , be &quot; appropriate , &quot; which can be interpreted differently on a case @-@ to @-@ case basis .
Becker advises that you wait at least five minutes before a fault with the traffic lights can be assumed .
anyone who drives on in spite of a red light must , however , be aware that he / she will be fully liable for any resulting accident .
anyone who waits for less than five minutes has , under certain circumstances , not waited long enough , warned Becker , referring to a ruling of the Hamm Higher Regional Court .
in the case in question , a driver ignored a light that was permanently red after around three minutes and and was held responsible for neg@@ ligently jumping a red light .
the traffic lights were actually not defective , but rather turned green just a few minutes later .
he was spared a driving ban on account of the special circumstances - but was not spared a fine .
town Council delighted with solid budget
every time discussion in Town Council meetings turns to the budget , Mayor Ralph Ger@@ ster has good reason to smile .
the municipality coffers in Her@@ d@@ wan@@ gen @-@ Schön@@ ach are well stocked and the administration has been debt @-@ free since 2005 .
in this sense , this the 2012 budgetary year , can also be recorded as a complete success .
this became clear upon presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .
as Andrea Roth@@ mund explained , the administrative budget came in at more than EUR one million higher than originally planned , at around 7.6 million Euro .
the administrative budget surplus , at around EUR 1.8 million , also stood at around EUR one million above projections .
the surplus is primarily due to higher trade tax income and the local authorities &apos; contribution towards income tax .
the capital budget also stood well above the projected values .
instead of the projected EUR 1.5 million Euro , the value for last year was EUR 2.5 million .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget , &quot; said Roth@@ mund .
because fewer investments were made in the 2012 budgetary year than planned , the reserves also came in higher .
in total , they managed to increase the general contingency reserves by around EUR 2.1 million , to a total of EUR 4.9 million .
Mayor Ralph Ger@@ ster thanked Roth@@ mund and its team for the good work .
&quot; a job like this is not something you achieve overnight , &quot; said Ger@@ ster in praise of the annual financial statement .
he and the Town Coun@@ cill@@ ors are clearly delighted with the good figures .
it may sound like a paradox , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon work out expensive for the citizens .
in the past , a good financial situation meant that the local authorities could do away with high municipal rates .
however , according to Ger@@ ster , from time to time this has resulted in subsidies being reduced by the state .
there are prerequisites that must be fulfilled in order to receive these subsidies from various compensation elements .
among other requirements , the towns and municipalities applying for the subsidies must levy certain municipal rates .
&quot; we have to address the subject of municipal rates , as there are investments to be made in the coming years for which we could do with subsidies , &quot; commented Ger@@ ster regarding this matter .
Nag@@ old : Hugo Wer@@ m@@ ter - a choir member for 60 years
having been a singer for 60 years , Hubert Wer@@ m@@ ter &apos;s story with the C@@ ä@@ ci@@ lia Male Ch@@ oral Society is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival , during which he was cerem@@ oni@@ ally honoured .
as per usual , Hubert Wer@@ m@@ ter stood on the stage in the colours of his male voice choir .
even after 60 years he still finds great pleasure from singing with the choir , which has achieved much more than popularity during this period .
Wer@@ m@@ ter has also been active within the association , serving as a member of the committee for 28 years , among other roles .
for his commitment and loyalty to the organisation , he has also received several awards : Jörg Koh@@ r , L@@ ay Pastor acting on behalf of the C@@ ä@@ ci@@ lian Association of Rot@@ tenburg @-@ Stuttgart , presented him with an Association Certificate and a letter of commend@@ ation signed by Bishop Geb@@ hard Fürst - the choir also serves as a church choir .
his choir colleagues presented him with a German Ch@@ oral Association certificate and an engraved pe@@ w@@ ter plate .
aside from honouring Hugo , the 31st Autumn Festival progressed as usual : alongside the Bet@@ ra Male Voice Choir , the Salz@@ st@@ etten Ch@@ oral Club , the Ba@@ is@@ ingen Ch@@ oral Division and the Local Music Society , the Voll@@ mar@@ ingen singers delivered a colourful blend of different choral and song styles , which entertained the 400 or so visitors .
the Voll@@ mar@@ ingen Male Voice Choir got things running with atmospheric songs such as &quot; Im Wein@@ paradies &quot; and &quot; Lus@@ tig , ihr Brüder . &quot;
they had also prepared a short seren@@ ade as a tribute to their honorary singer Hubert Wer@@ m@@ ter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart &apos;s &quot; Bundes@@ lied . &quot;
the Bet@@ ra Male Voice Choir also sang classic choral pieces such as &quot; Jäger@@ werben &quot; by Julius Wen@@ gert , &quot; weit , weit weg &quot; by Hubert Go@@ is@@ ern and the folk song &quot; W@@ ann du durch@@ geh@@ st durchs Tal . &quot;
with its mixed choir and its ladies &apos; ensemble - the &quot; Impul@@ sch@@ or &quot; ( Impulse Choir ) , the Salz@@ st@@ etten Ch@@ oral Club ensured that the female quota was fulfilled at the festival .
the mixed choir carried listeners away to foreign lands with the Nea@@ politan fol@@ k@@ songs &quot; Santa Lucia &quot; and &quot; Evi@@ va Esp@@ ana &quot; by An@@ tos G@@ us , while the &quot; Impul@@ sch@@ or &quot; also drew on foreign languages : &quot; Liber@@ atio &quot; and &quot; Hey Jude &quot; were included on their programme .
the Ch@@ oral Division of the Ba@@ is@@ ingen Sports Club returned to its home ground with &quot; Was I@@ sch der Schw@@ ob ? &quot; by Hans Sü@@ ss@@ muth and Robert Pap@@ pert &apos;s &quot; Bier@@ lied , &quot; while the Voll@@ mar@@ ingen Music Society provided the crow@@ ning musical conclusion .
for children , there was a small auxiliary programme - &quot; O@@ ma Han@@ ne &quot; ( Grand@@ ma Han@@ ne ) , a.@@ k.@@ a Hann@@ el@@ ore St@@ oll@@ stei@@ mer , performed a &apos; Kasper@@ l &apos; theater ( similar to P@@ unch and Ju@@ dy ) and read some stories , which kept the children entertained throughout the afternoon .
children &apos;s dreams come true
over the next few days , the nursery schools and day care centres in Zoll@@ ern@@ al@@ b district will be receiving mail .
the Schwarzw@@ äl@@ der B@@ ote ( Black Forest Herald ) , in collaboration with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zoll@@ ern@@ al@@ b Savings Bank , would like to support the institutions in granting their construction and renovation wishes .
does the nursery school need a new sand box ?
all nur@@ series , day care centres and cré@@ ches from across the entire Zoll@@ ern@@ al@@ b district can become involved in the campaign .
if they have a construction or renovation request for their institution , they can register this with the Schwarzw@@ äl@@ der B@@ ote .
get creative with your children and surprise the judging panel of the Kindergarten @-@ Baustelle ( Nur@@ sery School @-@ Construction Site ) campaign .
a panel consisting of representatives from the Schwarzw@@ äl@@ der B@@ ote , Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zoll@@ ern@@ al@@ b will select three wishes from those submitted .
what are the requirements for participation ?
it must be possible to fulfil the wish using construction materials to a maximum value of EUR 2,000 and on one ( campaign ) day .
furthermore , the winner must provide a number of hard @-@ working building helpers .
what is the deal with the campaign day and the helpers ?
with the support of the Sparkasse Zoll@@ ern@@ al@@ b , Bauhaus will be providing the materials .
they will be delivered to the nursery schools on an agreed day and should there be assembled / made use of directly by the helpers .
helpers can include parents , grandparents , friends , organisations and , of course , the teachers and children themselves .
Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law
&quot; it is a frightening place , and it is valid to ask : what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow ? &quot; the paper said , challenging the bill as un@@ constitutional .
&quot; this law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it , &quot; said Cy@@ rus Kam@@ au , managing director for Capital Group - home to Cap@@ ital@@ FM , one of Kenya &apos;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .
he said the new media tribunal &quot; will always be biased because it &apos;s an extension of the government , &quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
&quot; I hope the president will listen to us , and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs , &quot; he said .
according to The Star newspaper , the new bill will effectively hand the government &quot; a stran@@ gl@@ ehold over the media , &quot; while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been &quot; dealt a major blow &quot; and lam@@ bast@@ ed the bill as &quot; draconian . &quot;
the passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September &apos;s attack by Islamist gun@@ men on the West@@ gate shopping mall .
Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack pur@@ port@@ edly robbing the up@@ market mall .
police chief David K@@ ima@@ i@@ yo reacted by summon@@ ing two journalists and a media executive for questioning , although the sum@@ mons was re@@ tracted following a media outcry .
under the new bill , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan sh@@ ill@@ ings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being &quot; de @-@ listed , &quot; or barred from receiving official press accreditation .
the tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an off@@ ender if a fine is not paid .
according to the Daily Nation , &quot; even one fine is enough to cri@@ pple most FM stations . &quot;
it also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya &apos;s &quot; lively blo@@ go@@ sphere . &quot;
by silen@@ cing the media , politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity .
&quot; no one will ever know , &quot; wrote Nation journalist Mut@@ uma Ma@@ thi@@ u , describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life .
&quot; left to themselves , politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering , &quot; he wrote .
Kenyan law@@ makers have been the target of public anger in the past .
in May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinstate their hef@@ ty salaries of around 5@@ 32@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings a month tax @-@ free - ranked among the highest in the world .
bad @-@ Dür@@ r@@ heim : a dream comes true for the FC
the official inaugural ceremony for the astro @-@ turf sports field did not wane in significance for the town and the football club , in spite of the cold weather and rain .
everyone had hoped for more pleasant conditions for the ceremony last Saturday , however the weather gods chose not to cooperate .
so anyone who came without an umbrella , or for whatever reason could not hold onto one , drew the short straw .
this was the case for the musicians who accompanied the ceremony , as well as for a number of speakers .
thus , FC Chairman Albrecht Schl@@ en@@ ker , who spoke of the fulfilment of a dream , also got fairly wet .
his thanks went first and foremost to Mayor Walter Kl@@ um@@ pp , who was heavily involved in the realisation of the project , the Town Council , the companies involved and club members who played a part .
particular mention went out to Lothar Held , Paul Weizen@@ egger , H@@ einer G@@ ail and Peter Graf .
the Sp@@ ry pensioners laid 400 square metres of flag@@ ging for the new paths .
this remarkable voluntary commitment was also honoured by Member of the State Parliament , Karl Rom@@ bach .
further words of greeting were issued to the town Sports Commissioner , Hubert Bai@@ er , the District Chair@@ person of the Southern Baden Football Association , Kun@@ o Kay@@ an , and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office , who announced a donation to the club &apos;s youth division .
Mayor Kl@@ um@@ pp recalled that weather @-@ related influences in the Spring and Autumn had repeatedly afflicted the original sports field , to such an extent that it could not be played on .
it was way back 15 years ago that solutions to the problem were first considered , when the construction of a third pitch on the football club site or at the secondary school on Sal@@ inen@@ see Lake were considered .
both ideas were rejected .
six years ago , thoughts turned to laying an astro @-@ turf pitch , which was generally viewed as the perfect solution .
specific plans were drawn up two years ago , when the FC inherited the Sch@@ abel@@ stube in le@@ as@@ ehold , promised a contribution of EUR 100,000 for the construction of the pitch and the state approved a subsidy of EUR 10@@ 4,000 .
in October 2012 , the Town Council decided to cover the remaining EUR 35@@ 6,000 of the total cost of EUR 5@@ 60,000 , summarised Kl@@ um@@ pp .
work began on the 68 x 108 metre astro @-@ turf pitch on 4 June .
during the construction phase , which lasted over three months , 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed , of which half was used for the laying of a dirt bike track .
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations , addressing the topics of internal affairs and justice .
to this end , the competent working group met this morning .
among other issues , topics discussed included direct democracy , the bri@@ bery of MPs and the Federal Police .
during the morning , the Migration and Integration working group also sought to continue its discussions .
among the issues to be addressed was that of dual nationality , in which regard both sides have opposing ideas .
the SPD would like to put an end to the pressure placed on immigrant children to decide on one nationality - the Union rejects the notion of a dual passport .
regarding the subject of traffic , which was not on the agenda for this Friday , the SPD substantiated its opposition to a car toll charge promoted by the CSU .
a toll road sticker would amount to a &quot; flat rate fee for frequent drivers and would thus be environmentally counterproductive , &quot; explained the SPD negotiator for issues relating to traffic , Florian Pron@@ old , in a letter to his parliamentary group .
there would be a threat of diverted traffic on country roads , which are already accident hotspots .
the introduction of a toll for cars would also only be a first step , in Pron@@ old &apos;s eyes .
&quot; there is the risk that the compensation for Germans would be abolished at a later point in time , &quot; he said .
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart : the &quot; singing mountain wave &quot; on the open @-@ air stage
Stuttgart - &quot; When will it be summer again ? &quot; was actually not the question on people &apos;s lips at the Kill@@ es@@ berg Open @-@ Air Theatre on Friday evening .
it genuinely was a tropical evening in Stuttgart .
this therefore provided the ideal conditions for pop star , Dieter Thomas Kuhn , and his band .

car driver seriously injured in accident
a 37 @-@ year @-@ old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday evening .
according to information from the police , a 41 @-@ year @-@ old from Mü@@ sch was travelling in his car on the Kemp@@ ener bypass in the direction of Gre@@ fra@@ th , at around 9.@@ 15 p.@@ m ..
as he went to turn right onto St. T@@ ön@@ iser Straße he failed to see the 37 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s on@@ coming vehicle .
the vehicles colli@@ ded .
the Aachen resident suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment .
Konstanz : road block following accident on the Sch@@ än@@ z@@ le roundabout
according to police , the accident occurred when a 51 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza was travelling out of town in the left lane of the two @-@ lane Reichen@@ au@@ strasse .
shortly before the Sch@@ än@@ z@@ le roundabout he noticed that was in the left @-@ turn lane going in the direction of Stro@@ me@@ y@@ ers@@ dorf@@ straße and moved across to the right lane .
in so doing , he colli@@ ded with the BMW of a 23 @-@ year @-@ old Konstanz resident , travelling in that lane .
the VW Pass@@ at of a 19 @-@ year @-@ old driver travelling behind the BMW was also damaged .
in total , EUR 15,000 of material damage was caused , announced the police .
the road had to be blocked off while the accident was being investigated , the statement continued .
Vienna Airport abol@@ ishes passenger call @-@ outs
Mr. Max Mai@@ er , please make your way to Gate 24 .
in future , announcements such as this will no longer happen at Vienna International Airport .
the majority of loudspeaker announcements will cease - thus considerably reducing the noise level .
the goal of this adjustment is to create a more relaxing atmosphere .
as airport spokesperson Peter Kle@@ eman announced to Radio Vienna that in adjusting the approach towards announcements , Vienna Airport is following an international trend .
among others , the airports in Kopenhagen , Frankfurt and Dubai have already done away with the noisy call @-@ outs .
by doing away with these announcements - on average around 200 personal call @-@ outs come through the loud@@ speakers per day - the atmosphere in the airport should be cal@@ mer in future .
&quot; experience has also shown that these individual announcements are relatively seldom taken notice of , and at the same time , all other information regarding changes to departure gates or flight times are somewhat lost among them , &quot; said Kle@@ eman while chatting to the radio broad@@ caster .
Highland Games in Kal@@ ten@@ hof
alongside brake van pulling with tractors , there will also be a second contest at the agricultural autumn festival at Kal@@ ten@@ hof from 6 to 8 September .
on Saturday 7 September , the Highland Games will start at 1 : 30 p.m.
while they are of course a Scottish tradition , they have been given a touch of Sw@@ ab@@ ian colour at the Kal@@ ten@@ hof event grounds .
teams and individual competitors will be p@@ itted against one another in the disciplines of to@@ ssing the c@@ aber , hor@@ ses@@ hoe to@@ ssing and bucket carrying .
the c@@ aber is four and a half metres long and weighs 25 to 30 kilometres .
&quot; it isn &apos;t about the distance , &quot; explains organiser Peter Sai@@ le .
the log must be thrown vertically , som@@ ers@@ ault once and then finish lying straight .
this scores maximum points .
in to@@ ssing the hor@@ ses@@ hoe , it all comes down to accuracy .
hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ es are thrown onto a peg from a distance of eight metres .
participants must then prove their skill and strength by carrying a bucket of water 50 metres .
time is recorded and water quantity measured in a vat at the end .
two members of each &quot; clan &quot; or team can then take part in the individual competition .
the winners of the team and individual contests receive prizes .
teams can practice from 10 : 00 a.m.
suitable clothing is desirable - for example competitors can wear kil@@ ts .
however , Sw@@ ab@@ ian traditional clothing is also permitted .
the judging panel will also award a few bonus points for &quot; out@@ fits . &quot;
registration is open until a few hours prior to the beginning of the competition .
with the Scottish @-@ Sw@@ ab@@ ian Highland Games and the tractor pulling contest , which will begin half an hour beforehand , there promises to be a great deal of action at the event grounds on Saturday .
in the evening , fans of brass band music will be in for a treat of their own .
at 19 : 00 , the &quot; bir@@ ab@@ öh@@ mische &quot; ( a play on words allu@@ ding to the regions pear trees , Bohemia , and perhaps their love of beer as well ! ) wind music group from Schö@@ m@@ berg , provide a great evening of entertainment .
the band plays lively pol@@ kas and marches .
however , their repertoire also includes emo@@ tive wal@@ tz@@ es and a full big band sound .
Heinz Koch from Wei@@ len unter den R@@ innen will also be there , better known as the &apos; singing inn keeper and black sausage bar@@ on . &quot;
in the past , he has appeared at the Christmas market in Dorn@@ han and the Nar@@ ren@@ zun@@ ft ( F@@ ool &apos;s Guild event ) .
on Sunday , the Lein@@ st@@ etten Music Society will entertain audiences with a morning session , with the B@@ öff@@ ingen Farmer &apos;s Band as guests from 2 : 00 p.m. , and then the &quot; Ol@@ dies &quot; will bring the celebrations to a close .
the celebrations will get under way on Friday , with the &quot; St@@ oppel@@ acker &quot; ( Stub@@ ble Field ) party featuring DJ Ralf .
other items in the itinerary on Saturday and Sunday include the vintage car and tractor meet and exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry .
further attractions on Sunday are the corn maze , the craft market and sheep sh@@ earing .
specially for children , there is a pet@@ ting zoo , &quot; straw boun@@ cy castle , &quot; tractor driving ( under supervision ) and tractor surfing .
the event is organised by the community hall association , the ski club and the &quot; Zünd@@ kap@@ sel@@ e &quot; ( blasting caps ) tractor enthusiasts .
an overview of milk and egg alternatives
vegan nutrition promotes vegetable alternatives to eggs , milk and dairy products .
m@@ ashed to@@ fu with plant cream , for example , serves as a substitute for quar@@ k cheese .
the Veget@@ arian Association will provide further examples on World Veg@@ an Day on 1 November .
on the occasion of World vegan Day on 1 November , the Veget@@ arian Association of Germany will propose a host of vegan alternatives :
pure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to butter , while yoghurt can be replaced by soya yoghurt .
soya , o@@ at , almond or rice milk can be used in place of milk .
plant whi@@ pping cream can replace traditional whi@@ pping cream .
there are also plant alternatives to eggs .
half a m@@ ashed , ripe banana , for example , can replace an egg as a binding agent in a cake .
50 grams of apple sauce or a tabl@@ es@@ po@@ on of ground lin@@ seed plus three tabl@@ es@@ po@@ ons of water are also suitable .
a dough becomes flu@@ ffy by replacing egg with a mixture of one tabl@@ es@@ po@@ on of baking powder , one tabl@@ es@@ po@@ on of corn@@ flour and three tabl@@ es@@ po@@ ons of mineral water , for example .
50 grams of soya yoghurt or sil@@ ken to@@ fu can also fulfil this purpose .
according to information from the Veget@@ arian Association , around 800@@ ,000 Germans currently have a vegan diet , i.e. a 100 % vegetable diet .
sle@@ e@@ pless in New York
on the way to their host families in Wey@@ mouth , Massachusetts , the pupils of the Schwarzwald Gramm@@ ar School got to know the American city of New York .
after an eight @-@ hour flight , they headed straight for Brooklyn Bridge , via which the heart of the city , Manhattan , can be reached on foot .
from here there is a fascinating view of the world @-@ famous skyline , which is particularly impressive in the evening light .
due to the time difference , the pupils had been on the go for almost 24 hours , however , true to the slogan , &quot; the city never sleeps , &quot; the day was rounded off with a trip to Times Square .
in spite of a shutdown , they were able to visit the Statue of Liberty on the second day , and climb the statue on foot .
they then moved on to the Financial District , via Wall Street , to visit the 9 / 11 memorial .
on the third day , the pupils were able to take in an overview of the fascinating city from the viewing platform of the Empire State Building , enjoying the views from a height of 3@@ 73 metres .
they then made their way through the hustle and bustle of the New York streets , via the Ro@@ cker@@ f@@ eller Center , to Central Park , which provided the perfect opportunity to rest a while in the Autumn sun .
following a short flight from New York to Boston , the pupils have now arrived with their host families and are experiencing the school day at Wey@@ mouth High School .
once again this year , on Saint Hubert &apos;s day , a Hubert mass will be celebrated in the Parish of St. M@@ arien on Hül@@ s@@ berg@@ strasse .
St. Hubert was , according to legend , a truly ruthless hunter , who converted following a vision and was later appointed Bishop of Lüt@@ tich .
hunting horn group &quot; Jag@@ drei@@ ter Westfalen , &quot; under the direc@@ tor@@ ship of Brigitte Klu@@ th , played old , traditional French melodies on par@@ force horns ( natural horns in the key of E flat ) .
the wind players wear riding clothes , as they provide musical accompaniment mainly for riders , horses and packs of ho@@ unds on drag hun@@ ts .
the solemn mass is to take place on Sunday 3 November at 11.30 a.m.
the newly designed Op@@ schlag stands out with a new café .
one that invites you to linger a while and to come again .
one that wants to get its name out there .
according to dictionaries , déjà vu is defined as a psychological phenomenon , which expresses itself in the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation .
in the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the Op@@ schlag in Kle@@ ve County , with a view of the Rhein @-@ Wa@@ al University , it doesn &apos;t always have to remain a pure déjà vu feeling .
ultimately , this is precisely the aim of the café with the wonderful name : to make an actual visit and something that can be repeated on a recurring basis , not just theoretically , but tan@@ gi@@ bly .
because it is fun and simply beautiful .
a glance into the internal workings at Op@@ schlag 8 gives the on@@ look@@ er a positive feeling right from the outset .
with its ultra @-@ modern yet cosy café ambience , it looks like a place designed to make you feel good .
the team here , with business founders , Mir@@ jam van der St@@ elt and Daniel Bü@@ t@@ tner at the helm , spo@@ ils guests with a wide range of coffees and cocktails .
in addition to this , there are delicious cakes or freshly baked b@@ agu@@ ettes , filled to order .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name for themselves as restaur@@ ateurs prior to opening the chic café on the Op@@ schlag : they previously managed the &quot; Art Lounge &quot; in Kran@@ enburg .
by moving to Kle@@ ve on the Op@@ schlag , the friendly café lovers hope to reach a wider audience .
not least through university customers .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; emphasises Daniel Bü@@ t@@ tner .
in actual fact , here the pair hope to appeal as much to young students as they do to senior citizens and all age brackets .
speaking of café lovers ...
the two friendly owners are motivated by their love of coffee .
they themselves enjoy the fragrant , hot brew in a vari@@ et of formats .
espresso fan
Daniel Bü@@ t@@ tner is more of an espresso fan , while Mir@@ jam van der St@@ elt is the capp@@ uccino drin@@ ker .
&quot; and a b@@ agu@@ ette with it - that &apos;s my thing , &quot; she revealed to the NR@@ Z .
there have already been two events held in the brightly lit café .
or perhaps more accurately , one .
this is because the Hafen@@ fest took place more outside than in - Café Dé@@ jà Vu did not benefit from it .
however , there was also the Ring@@ el@@ nat@@ z evening .
the two 33 @-@ year @-@ olds found it &quot; beautiful , successful and funny . &quot;
but it was not for everyone .
perhaps this is why Daniel Bü@@ t@@ tner is not a vocal fan of evening events : &quot; you just cannot please everyone . &quot;
and with an event , I am always only appealing to those who have expressed an interest in the special event .
for this reason , events will always be an exception to the rule for us .
&quot; we want to cause as little disruption as possible to normal business . &quot;
that is to say : déjà Vu also stands for reliability .
this is with regard to the quality of the products that are offered here , as well as the team and the fantastic setting on the Op@@ schlag in Kle@@ ve .
the street that is fast becoming a &apos; restaurant mile &apos; .
this is to the delight of many Kle@@ ve residents , guests from near and far and the students who are discovering the &apos; restaurant mile &apos; , and with it the Café Dé@@ jà Vu , for themselves .

a day of thanks with the M@@ GV ( Male Ch@@ oral Society ) in Din@@ ker
this year the &quot; Friedrich Wilhelm Din@@ ker &quot; M@@ GV issued an invitation to its 16@@ 5th anniversary celebration , which 52 guests , active singers and their wives were happy to accept .
in the club@@ house at the &quot; Witt@@ eb@@ org &quot; Inn in Din@@ ker , all those present enjoyed the friendly get @-@ together in the name of music .
traditionally , the anniversary celebration is also always the fitting occasion to best@@ ow honours .
this time around , secretary Rolf Wag@@ ener was delighted to receive the special &quot; Singer of the Year &quot; award .
&quot; not only have you kept countless records for us , but you have also done so much running around for us , and for this we offer our sincere thanks , &quot; said Choir Chairman Erich Schl@@ ot@@ mann .
the awards for participation in the performances and choir rehear@@ sals by means of the presentation of &quot; activity Posi@@ es , &quot; this year went to Choir Director Dieter Schulze , with 44 attendance marks , followed by Honor@@ ary Chairman Horst Pier @-@ Rib@@ bert , the Chairman himself , and last year &apos;s &quot; Singer of the Year &quot; Friedrich Winkler , each having attended 42 times .
fifth place went to Ar@@ tur Brück@@ ner , responsible for organising music copies .
the Board of Directors gave special thanks to the team managed by inn@@ keeper , An@@ ge Pier @-@ Rib@@ bert , which once again delighted those present with a top class menu , and to Ger@@ da Pier @-@ Rib@@ bert for the table decorations .
the &quot; Friedrich @-@ Wilhelm &quot; M@@ GV meets for its regular choir rehear@@ sals in the club@@ house every Tuesday at 19 : 45 .
&quot; new voices that love to sing are more than welcome any time , &quot; said Schl@@ ot@@ mann .
UN ha@@ ils new goals to tackle poverty
the United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millennium development goals , which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty .
Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for &quot; sustainable development goals &quot; to replace the MDGs , which expire in 2015 , ahead of the UN sustainable development summit that began in Rio de Janeiro overnight .
they were included in the final draft of the document , which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms Gill@@ ard during the summit .
UN Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon told the summit overnight that now is the time to &quot; rise above national interests . &quot;
&quot; I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals - SD@@ Gs , &quot; he said .
these SD@@ Gs will build on our advances under the millennium development goals , and they will be an integral part of the post @-@ 2015 development framework .
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realise our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs .
even though the SG Achim / Baden has gone four match days without victory , a positive mood is still prevailing within the top flight hand@@ ball team .
trainer Tom@@ as@@ z Mal@@ mon will not let there be any doubt of this fact .
everyone is still fully motivated for the task at hand .
that said , I do hope that we finally start winning again .
&quot; I no longer remember how a victory like that tastes , &quot; said Mal@@ mon , anticipating success for his team at Vf@@ L Fre@@ den@@ beck II .
even though the third @-@ tier reserves from Fre@@ den@@ beck are no &apos;t exactly in the best form at the moment , Mal@@ mon has issued a warning in advance
I trained many of the players myself in the A @-@ Youth .
consequently , they will be particularly motivated playing against their former coach .
&quot; in addition , we will have to wait and see whether rein@@ for@@ cements from the first team will be there , &quot; explained the SG coach .
in any case , if they are to finally get back on the winning track , Mal@@ mon &apos;s team will have to improve on recent performances .
there have been major problems , primarily in terms of covering and counter attacking .
the team &apos;s eye for the goal must be considerably improved .
therefore , I hope that my players have finally managed to clear their heads during the short break .
Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash
with a statue of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , Mozambique &apos;s founding president , star@@ ing down on them , thousands of people gathered in central Map@@ uto to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration .
&quot; we want peace back ; we want stability , &quot; said Vanessa de S@@ ous@@ a , chief executive of an investment company .
fearful about the future of her country , she sw@@ apped her corporate atti@@ re for a T @-@ shirt emb@@ la@@ z@@ oned with &quot; we demand security &quot; in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital &apos;s Independence Square on Thursday .
for two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and REN@@ AM@@ O , some of the worst skir@@ m@@ ishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago .
REN@@ AM@@ O was once a notorious rebel movement , initially backed by white @-@ ruled Rho@@ des@@ ia and then South Africa &apos;s apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country &apos;s independent government .
after a 1992 peace deal , it became an opposition party .
analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full @-@ blown conflict , but recent events have un@@ ner@@ ved foreign investors and locals .
the stakes are high for the fast @-@ growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $ 50@@ bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio T@@ into , Vale of Brazil , En@@ i of Italy and An@@ ad@@ ark@@ o of the US .
the ruling F@@ rel@@ imo party , the dominant political force since 1975 , and REN@@ AM@@ O blame each other for the tension .
REN@@ AM@@ O says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sof@@ ala province , traditionally a REN@@ AM@@ O stronghold , on October 17 .
assaults on the former rebels then escal@@ ated as government forces attacked REN@@ AM@@ O bases and attempted to kill Af@@ onso D@@ h@@ lak@@ ama , the group &apos;s leader , Fernando Maz@@ anga , REN@@ AM@@ O &apos;s spokesman , told the Financial Times .
the government bl@@ ames REN@@ AM@@ O for triggering the clashes , accusing it of attacking soldiers .
President Ar@@ mand@@ o Gu@@ ebu@@ za has sought to play down concerns about instability .
Mr Gu@@ ebu@@ za told AFP , the French news agency , on Wednesday that Mr D@@ h@@ lak@@ ama saw himself as a &quot; loser &quot; who wanted to use &quot; whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions . &quot;
both F@@ rel@@ imo and REN@@ AM@@ O insist they want to avoid war .
but concerns have grown after Mr Maz@@ anga was quoted as saying REN@@ AM@@ O was abandoning the 1992 peace accord .
he told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by F@@ rel@@ imo .
&quot; our vision is to come back to negotiations , but with seriousness , &quot; Mr Maz@@ anga said .
previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year .
&quot; it &apos;s two big men ( Gu@@ ebu@@ za and D@@ h@@ lak@@ ama ) but@@ ting heads together , &quot; said Joseph Han@@ lon , a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .
neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary .
REN@@ AM@@ O , which has been pushing for electoral reforms , had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November .
presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year .
some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spo@@ ils from the government .
REN@@ AM@@ O &apos;s share of the vote has been declining since 1992 , while a newer party , the Democratic Movement of Mozambique ( MD@@ M ) which was formed by a former REN@@ AM@@ O member , is expected to improve its showing at the elections .
Mr Maz@@ anga says Mr Gu@@ ebu@@ za - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .
&quot; he does not want multi @-@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , &quot; Mr Maz@@ anga said .
it is unclear how much capacity REN@@ AM@@ O has , but it has carried out disruptive hit @-@ and @-@ run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north @-@ south highway .
most of the skir@@ m@@ ishes have taken place in Sof@@ ala province , which is several hundred kilometres north of Map@@ uto , but hosts Bei@@ ra , the port that miners , including Rio T@@ into and Vale , rely on to export coal .
in June , Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after REN@@ AM@@ O threatened to attack the line .
Mr Maz@@ anga was co@@ y when asked about whether REN@@ AM@@ O would repeat this threat .
REN@@ AM@@ O wanted to &quot; warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique , &quot; Mr Maz@@ anga said .
the instability has added to frustr@@ ations with the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Medi@@ aco@@ op , an independent media company , with many people also concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development and a recent sp@@ ate of kidn@@ app@@ ings .
&quot; people think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president , and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems , &quot; he says .
Omar Sul@@ tu@@ ane , a demonstr@@ ator , said people just wanted stability .
&quot; no one cares about REN@@ AM@@ O and F@@ rel@@ imo , they just want peace again , they want free access to the roads , &quot; he said .
children should be taught myths and legends as &quot; models for a way of life , &quot; author says .
tales of Th@@ or could show &quot; bru@@ te strength is no match for subtle tri@@ ckery , &quot; while the Ar@@ th@@ ur@@ ian legends reveal the importance of having a dream .
saying many of the myths would be &quot; far too wild , far too scandalous and in some cases far too fil@@ thy to be taught in schools , &quot; Cross@@ ley @-@ Holland advocated a &quot; careful selection &quot; of age @-@ appropriate works .
&quot; I find it wonderful that in America , myth and folklore already has a part in education , &quot; he said .
I have been advocating it as a plan for twenty years .
he added authors and teachers being &quot; over@@ tly did@@ actic &quot; is a &quot; total switch @-@ off &quot; for children , with messages being &quot; sub@@ li@@ min@@ ated &quot; in enjoyable stories .
Cross@@ ley @-@ Holland , who has translated Be@@ ow@@ ulf from Anglo @-@ Saxon as well as writing the Pen@@ guin Book of Nor@@ se My@@ ths and British Folk Tales , said : &quot; you may well have intentions but you do better to keep them well out of sight . &quot;
perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope .
not that everything has to be simplified or come to a happy ending , but that there is an inn@@ ate sense of good and evil .
and that must be sub@@ li@@ min@@ ated ; revealed through a story rather than stated .
the old basis of showing not telling .
Hans@@ jak@@ ob back in FRE@@ IH@@ OF once again
100 years ago , Heinrich Hans@@ jak@@ ob moved into his retirement home in Has@@ lach , on Sunday his final years in the &quot; FRE@@ IH@@ OF &quot; were brought to life .
the large audience was inspired by the extremely amusing role play .
from his arrival , to his being conferred with honorary citizenship and his death , Alois Kraf@@ tz@@ cy@@ k , the scrip@@ tw@@ rit@@ er and actor portra@@ ying Hans@@ jak@@ ob , has written an entertaining play , which received great acclaim under the direc@@ tor@@ ship of Corn@@ elia Volk .
Marcus Z@@ ager@@ mann , serving as narr@@ ator , guided the audience through the ten different scenes , explained circumstances and provided links explaining le@@ aps from his youth to the time when he was approaching retirement .
on 22 October 1913 , Hans@@ jak@@ ob returned home to his childhood paradise , to his FRE@@ IH@@ OF .
it was there that the role @-@ play began , with Alois Kraf@@ czy@@ k shining once again in his famous role as the town &apos;s great son .
true to style , he travelled with a two @-@ horse carriage drawn by &quot; Schwarzw@@ äl@@ der Fü@@ ch@@ sen &quot; ( Black Forest Ch@@ est@@ nut Hor@@ ses ) owned by Erich Bech@@ erer from Müh@@ len@@ bach .
not only was he received with great applause from the audience , but was also welcomed by his sister Philippine .
Billy S@@ um @-@ Hermann managed unbeliev@@ ably well to place herself in the role of the sister and brought the character to life amazingly well , in terms of both her expressions and gestures .
between the individual scenes , the Müh@@ len@@ bacher Bauern@@ kapelle played appropriately selected musical pieces , thus rounding off the performance .
the honour of presenting the title of honorary citizen went to Has@@ lach &apos;s Mayor , Heinz Winkler , who , together with a section of the Town Council , made an appearance representing the Mayor of H@@ üt@@ tich from back in Hans@@ jak@@ ob &apos;s day .
the &quot; Drei@@ könig &quot; singers then made their own appearance , leading Hans@@ jak@@ ob to exc@@ laim : &quot; Oh how beautiful , this brings childhood memories of my own time in a Drei@@ könig group back to life . &quot;
with their song , &quot; O Jes@@ ul@@ ein , &quot; they delighted the audience in the FRE@@ IH@@ OF , as did the &quot; Stor@@ chent@@ ag@@ sk@@ inder &quot; with their loud cries of &quot; heraus , heraus &quot; .
in his day , Hans@@ jak@@ ob expressed his criticism of the institutional church , as well as his concerns regarding the excesses in the rural economy , the consequences of industrialisation and the effects of the war .
he found his place of rest on his native soil , behind his maus@@ oleum on the Brand near Hof@@ st@@ etten .
the role @-@ play ended with the words &quot; A res@@ tless spirit finally found rest and returned home forever . &quot;
the performance received great applause and many words of praise from the audience .
basketball : hopes are growing for the Neckar Riesen ( Neckar Giants ) .
the chances of the relegated Ludwi@@ gsburg Bu@@ des@@ liga basketball players remaining in the league have improved .
this is because there is to be a wild card procedure , and the Neckar Riesen are now up against one applicant fewer .
the Hamburg Towers basketball project is declining to make an application for a possible stand @-@ in place .
&quot; we will not participate in the wild card process , &quot; said former national team player Pascal Roller , who has been putting together the concept for a professional club in the Hansa town since 2012 .
however , there was no si@@ gh of relief to be heard from Ludwi@@ gsburg .
&quot; we are not concerning ourselves with the wild card process until it is certain that Düsseldorf is not receiving a licence , &quot; said boss of the Neckar Riesen Alexander Rei@@ l , speaking to our paper .
newly promoted Düsseldorf Bas@@ kets have until 23 May to submit documents to the arbitration panel and prove their financial fitness for the Bundesliga .
however , the Rhineland team have already been refused the licence twice .
the Court of Arbitration is the authority of last resort .
Ha@@ iger@@ loch : focus on the Abend@@ mah@@ l@@ skirche
as the town &apos;s contribution to the 150@@ th anniversary of the Protestant Church in Ha@@ iger@@ loch , the town &apos;s Office of Culture and Tourism is to dedicate the last of this year &apos;s public thematic tours on Sunday 27 October to the Abend@@ s@@ mah@@ l@@ skirche ( Church of the Holy Comm@@ union ) .
following a visit to the Nuclear Bunker Museum , the focus will turn to Ha@@ iger@@ loch in the period after 1850 , when Ha@@ iger@@ loch came under Prussian rule .
the crow@@ ning glory will be a visit to the Abend@@ mah@@ l@@ skirche .
there the participants of the tour will be told the story of the construction of the church and will gain insight into the development of the Protestant congregation , in what is a Catholic area through and through .
last but not least , while in the church eyes will also turn to the last supp@@ er painting , painted by Friedrich Schü@@ z with the support of Walter Kr@@ ö@@ ll and Georg Hal@@ brit@@ ter .
it is a faithful reproduction of the famous work Leonardo da Vinci in Milan .
the meeting point for the one and a half hour tour is the Nuclear B@@ under Museum , at 3 : 00 p.m.
tickets are available from the ticket office at the Nuclear Bunker Museum .
the Ha@@ iger@@ loch Town Tourist Office is available for questions and to provide you with information .
Snow@@ den may make further statements in Russia
the former US intelligence expert , Edward Snow@@ den , may make further statements regarding the US espionage scandal from his Russian asylum .
representatives of the Federal Prosecutor could either submit questions in writing or meet the 30 @-@ year @-@ old in person in Russia .
this was reported by the Inter@@ fax Agency with reference to groups aware of the situation , which were not named in greater detail .
such matters are to be clarified at an intergovernmental level , it was stated .
a departure of Snow@@ den from Russia is virtually impossible .
&quot; if this were to happen , he would lose his status as a refugee , &quot; said the Agency , quoting their source .
because Germany is an ally of the USA , Snow@@ den would be at risk of deportation if he were to travel there , the source continued .
endurance pays dividends
six teams batt@@ led to become champion at the club tennis tournament .
in the end , it was the endurance of the Mai@@ er / Bron@@ ner team that decided the final match .
the tennis division of the Sport@@ freunde Rohr@@ dorf ( Rohr@@ dorf Sports Fans ) enjoyed perfect weather for the tournament for local clubs and enthusiasts .
the focus of the tournament was on the fun of playing tennis .
five matches were scheduled for each team , with every team playing one match against all the others .
the matches were doubles matches with a long set up to nine points , or a maximum duration of 45 minutes .
An@@ ja Schlich@@ ter managed the tournament
the organisation of the tournament was placed in the tru@@ sty hands of An@@ ja Schlich@@ ter , who was supported by Carmen Müller and In@@ ga Kron@@ em@@ ey@@ er .
after the first three matches and a lunch break with pasta , the tournament moved into the crucial phase .
the favourites , Andre Mai@@ er / Matthias Bron@@ ner , were tied with Michael Kli@@ ppel and Sad@@ min O@@ sm@@ ic@@ ic ( both teams from the SG Rohr@@ weiler ) , meaning that the last two games had to produce a vic@@ tor .
at the awards ceremony , Carmen Müller finally had the pleasure of presenting the Challenge Cup to Andre Mai@@ er and Matthias Bron@@ ner , who had shown the greatest staying power on the final leg .
second place was taken by the Michael Kli@@ ppel / Sad@@ min O@@ sm@@ ic@@ ic partnership .
bronze went to Rainer and Bernd Mai@@ er of the Asp@@ hal@@ tri@@ echer team .
in the late afternoon sun , accompanied by coffee and cake , the tournament drew to a successful close .
on the last weekend in August , the Vog@@ ts@@ bau@@ ern@@ hof Black Forest Open Air Museum in Gut@@ ach near Horn@@ berg will once again be firmly in the hands of children .
traditionally , the museum welcomes visitors on a Saturday and Sunday , this year on on 24 and 25 August , to a colourful party for children and families as part of the summer holiday programme , with numerous participation activities and events .
&quot; on both days , adults and children alike can learn various traditional handicrafts , &quot; said the press release .
whether producing soap , turning candles , fel@@ ting or making silk , there is a suitable activity whatever your age .
the children will receive help from regional artisans , present from 11.00 a.m. until 5 : 00 p.m.
activities will also be taking place in the museum workshop .
the young guests will be able to demonstrate their manual skills building cu@@ ck@@ oo pipes , water wheels or spinning tops .
the host of old games , such as wheel@@ bar@@ row racing or walking on stil@@ ts , promises plenty of fun .
here speed and coordination are the order of the day .
for any miniature det@@ ectives , the open air museum will be offering a mystery tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday , at midday and 2.00 p.m. respectively .
on a tour of the premises , the children will have to work out which stories are true and which have been made up .
in addition , visitors will have the special opportunity to get to know the open air museum on a carriage journey drawn by Black Forest Ch@@ est@@ nut horses .
it is not just horses that can be found and admired on the grounds , but many other animals such as sheep , goats , cows and chickens as well .
on the Sunday the children will also be able to enjoy the c@@ lown , Ot@@ sch , who will be doing p@@ ranks with the museum guests from 11.00 a.m.
meanwhile , a cosy and magical alternative will be provided by Hermann Bü@@ t@@ tner .
the story @-@ teller will be taking the younger guests to the wonderful world of fairytale at 11.00 a.m. , 1 : 00 p.m. and 3 : 00 p.m.
the traditional children &apos;s dance group from Gut@@ ach will also be performing at 11 : 30 a.m.
furthermore , on both event days , from 11.00 a.m. until 5.00 p.m. , numerous artisans such as the b@@ room maker , the se@@ wer , the sp@@ inner , the weaver and the b@@ aker will be letting visitors look over their shoulders .
so , visitors to the open air museum can expect a varied holiday programme right through to the end of the summer holidays in Baden @-@ Wuer@@ ttemberg .
in a small town in New Zealand , B@@ urt Mun@@ ro is considered a lov@@ able od@@ d@@ ball , all because he resolved to compete in a race in America with his 1920 motorbike .
in spite of his heart defect , B@@ urt could not be deter@@ red from pursuing his dream .
with his savings , a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop , he set off to Los Angeles by ship .
the film will be followed by coffee , tea and cake .
pier@@ cing be@@ ep distur@@ bs residents
R@@ hen@@ us Mid@@ gard has also invested highly in land
they stock@@ pile the coal that arrives on ships .
at the same time , the company also has other ir@@ ons in the fire at the location .
besides coal imports , R@@ hen@@ us Mid@@ gard is also active in the field of wind park logistics , among other ventures .
the co@@ als sh@@ immer black in the storage yard in front of the em@@ bank@@ ment .
here two huge blue st@@ acker and rec@@ laim@@ er machines distribute or load the co@@ als as required .
with each movement of the handling machines , a sh@@ rill warning noise rings out over the site .
&quot; the signals are for the purpose of security and are legally prescribed , &quot; said Matthias Sch@@ rell , Managing Director of R@@ hen@@ us Mid@@ gard in Wilhelm@@ sha@@ ven .
unfortunately , in the event of unfavourable wind , they can be heard from far away - and as a result there have already been a number of complaints from people from the north of the town .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old said that he is taking the complaints very seriously and has therefore been in touch with those affected .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in a position to make the warning signals quieter by means of the implementation of technical measures .
in future he will also seek open dialogue with neighbours .
for Matthias Sch@@ rell has some further plans at the location .
with the construction of the Lower Saxony Bridge , R@@ hen@@ us Mid@@ gard is continuing to focus on coal exports for power stations and is one of the major powers in this sector in Europe .
thanks to the mooring basin to the front of the terminal , sun@@ ken to a depth of 18.@@ 5 metres , it has for some time now been possible to un@@ load cap@@ es@@ ize bulk carriers here .
&quot; in terms of handling , this year we hope to break the 3 million tonne mark , &quot; said Sch@@ rell .
alongside the local E@@ on power plant , the imported co@@ als also go to power plants inland .
when the G@@ DF @-@ Suez plant is added to the network , around 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year will be realistic .
the three ship un@@ loaders on the bridge and the second transport belt could see this rise to 10 million .
Bavaria &apos;s basketball players optimistic in spite of first defeat .
even their first defeat in the Eurol@@ e@@ ague could not curtail the huge optimism of the FC Bayern München Basketball@@ ers .
&quot; no @-@ one can stop us believing that we can win , even against the best team in Europe over the last two years , &quot; assessed Bayern coach Sve@@ ti@@ slav Pes@@ ic following the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) defeat to title defenders Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ äus on Thursday evening .
we have delivered a message : basketball also exists in Munich !
in their first three appearances in the European top flight , the Munich team put in a good performance for long periods , but in the crucial phases were not sufficiently focussed .
initially the guests managed to turn a 15 @-@ point deficit into a lead , with 13 minutes to go , before Pir@@ äus was able to turn the game around once again .
&quot; we fought back incredibly well against the two @-@ time Eurol@@ e@@ ague champions , but then once again made careless mistakes .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .
Malcolm Del@@ an@@ ey and Ni@@ had D@@ jed@@ ovic were the most successful stri@@ kers for the Munich team , who had celebrated clear wins against the Italian Series champions Mont@@ ep@@ asch@@ i Siena , and the Polish title @-@ holders , Ziel@@ ona Gó@@ ra , in their first two games .
Ben Green@@ man : the Ten@@ th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival : the New Yorker
one could argue that New York City is the birthplace of stan@@ dup comedy in America : nearly a hundred years ago , the v@@ au@@ de@@ vil@@ lian Frank F@@ ay , who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre , on Broadway , started telling jokes directly to the crowd , in a convers@@ ational manner .
F@@ ay &apos;s innovation has been extended through the years , most recently by the New York Comedy Festival .
created and over@@ seen by Caroline Hirsch , the founder of the stan@@ dup institution Carol@@ ines , the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres .
&quot; most of these head@@ liners appeared at Carol@@ ines , and went on to greater success , to the point where they &apos;re too big to play a club , &quot; Hirsch said .
we built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them .
this year &apos;s event includes appearances by W@@ anda Sy@@ kes , Kath@@ y Griff@@ in , and Bill Mah@@ er , as well as &quot; Stand Up for Heroes , &quot; an annual music @-@ and @-@ comedy benefit for military veterans , at Madison Square Garden , featuring , among others , Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters , and Bill Cos@@ by .
as the festival has expanded , so has the world of comedy .
several of the com@@ edi@@ ans participating in this year &apos;s festival came up through non@@ traditional channels , such as shows on smaller networks , like Comedy Central , FX , and Spike .
Nick Kro@@ ll rose to prominence on a deep @-@ cable sit@@ com ( F@@ XX &apos;s gle@@ efully ra@@ un@@ chy fantasy @-@ football @-@ themed &quot; The League &quot; ) and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show .
Jenny S@@ late has been a cast member on both &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; and &quot; Parks and Recre@@ ation , &quot; though she is best known for her viral video series &quot; Marcel the Shell with Shoes On . &quot;
both Kro@@ ll and S@@ late , as well as other young com@@ edi@@ ans with distinctive voices ( the sur@@ really pessimistic Anthony Jes@@ el@@ nik , the w@@ ry , ra@@ cially focussed W. Kam@@ au Bell ) , are products of the decentralized world of American comedy .
one of the festival &apos;s biggest draws will be an interview : David Steinberg talking to Larry David .
Steinberg started as a stan@@ dup com@@ edian but has become an accomplished television and film director , as well as an unofficial comedy historian .
from 2005 to 2007 , he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot; Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg . &quot;
the meeting takes place at Town Hall , in the center of Manhattan .
&quot; the city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry &apos;s work , &quot; Steinberg said .
he was telling me that , when he &apos;s here , sometimes he &apos;ll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself , Hey , if I lose all my money , maybe I &apos;ll live here .
Iran satisfied with the nuclear negotiations process
Iran has expressed satisfaction with the negotiation process , one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany .
&quot; after many years , we have now reached an agreement with the International Nuclear Energy Authorities to clear up the differences from past years , &quot; wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Dsch@@ aw@@ ad Sar@@ if on his Facebook page .
it will without doubt be a long path , but the chief nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will come to a solution in the end .
drama in Uruguay : boys kill play@@ mate with mach@@ etes
two children have conf@@ essed to the murder of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old in Uruguay .
the two boys , aged 14 and 12 , had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them .
on Tuesday , armed with mach@@ etes and knives , they stab@@ bed the 11 @-@ year @-@ old to death and threw the body into a well , reported the &quot; El Pa@@ ís &quot; newspaper on Thursday .
they then went and played football in front of their homes in a working class district .
the body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pel@@ ado , 15 kilometres to the north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este .
a five year @-@ old half @-@ sister of the younger off@@ ender , who they took with them , was to make a statement as an alibi , stating that she was sexually ass@@ aulted by the boy .
however , when the girl described the progression of events to the police without mentioning an attack against herself , the two boys conf@@ essed to the pre @-@ medit@@ ated murder of the 11 @-@ year @-@ old .
the older of the pair cited a rivalry on the football field as the motive .
he was provisionally taken to a psychiatric young offenders institute .
p@@ im@@ p must go to prison
the District Court of Constance has condemned a 33 @-@ year @-@ old man from St. Geor@@ gen to three and a half years in prison for explo@@ itative human trafficking , p@@ imp@@ ing , issuing threats and griev@@ ous bodily harm .
the former German soldier who , following two tours in Afghanistan , had worked as a door@@ man , made a con@@ fession within the context of a plea @-@ bargaining procedure .
according to the con@@ fession , on five occasions he got to know women via Internet or telephone contacts , who he then sent out onto the streets against their will after a few weeks .
he broke any resistance by means of violence and the issuing of threats .
he kept the income from women , some of whom worked for him for years .
he prevented the women from making contact with the outside world by confisc@@ ating their mobile phones and SIM cards .
together with an ac@@ compli@@ ce , who proc@@ ured the women , he brought them to various bro@@ th@@ els in the south @-@ west .
there he had them monitored to some extent , in order to control their income .
appearing before the court , the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues serving alongside him in Afghanistan had lost their lives in an explosion .
once a psychiatric expert had cast considerable doubt on him suffering from any psychiatric condition , and thus on his limited culp@@ ability , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old made a full con@@ fession .
the court did not have to question any more of the female victims .
as an official from the Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department reported , following the first conviction achieved using telephone surveillance measures , at least four further cases of explo@@ itative human trafficking could be identified .
the intercepted conversations were characterised by a high level of aggression .
in subsequent hearings , the victims confirmed their or@@ deal .
a further witness , whereby one of the woman had suffered blue bru@@ ises all over her body , is yet to make a statement .
this is a case of a &quot; completely broken personality , &quot; that views the violence and exploitation in this field as normal .
yesterday the accused expressed regret for his behaviour .
&quot; I have removed myself from these circles and hope to lead a completely normal life following my imprisonment , &quot; he stated .
oil extends drop toward $ 96 a barrel
the price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China &apos;s power @-@ hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening .
benchmark U.S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $ 9@@ 6.@@ 24 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Exchange .
the contract fell 39 cents on Thursday , leaving it down 5.8 percent for the month of October .
ample supplies of crude have weighed on the price in recent weeks .
the Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased 4.1 million barrels last week .
over five weeks , supplies have risen by more than 25 million barrels .
but a suggestion of stronger demand came Friday from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an up@@ tick in activity .
that suggests China &apos;s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth re@@ bounded to 7.@@ 8 percent in the third quarter from a two @-@ decade low in the previous quarter .
Br@@ ent crude , a benchmark for international crude also used by U.S. refin@@ eries , fell 26 cents to $ 10@@ 8.@@ 58 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London .
Court blocks ruling on NY@@ PD stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k policy
a federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge &apos;s order requiring changes to the New York Police Department &apos;s stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k program and removed the judge from the case .
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appe@@ als said the decisions of Judge Sh@@ ira Schein@@ d@@ lin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city .
the judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people .
the city appealed her findings and her remedial orders , including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it .
the appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay .
the appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran af@@ oul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court .
the judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and His@@ panic men with its stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k program .
she appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes , including reforms in policies , training and supervision , and she ordered a pilot program to test body @-@ worn cameras in some prec@@ inc@@ ts where most stops occur .
in August , New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop .
an oral argument on the city &apos;s appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14 , 2014 .
the stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates .
stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k has been around for decades in some form , but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloom@@ berg to an all @-@ time high in 2011 of 68@@ 4,@@ 330 , mostly of black and His@@ panic men .
a lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men , all minorities , and became a class action case .
supporters of changes to the NY@@ PD &apos;s stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k program say the changes will end unfair practices , will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy .
opponents say the changes would lower police mor@@ ale but not crime , waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade .
the judge noted she wasn &apos;t putting an end to the stop @-@ and @-@ fris@@ k practice , which is constitutional , but was reforming the way the NY@@ PD implemented its stops .
on the happiness of dreaming cam@@ els
happiness is an oasis that only dreaming cam@@ els manage to reach
it was with this piece of Bed@@ ou@@ in wisdom that the first ever chairman Wolfgang Hen@@ ne described the history and fascination behind the &quot; Hel@@ ping Hands &quot; society .
Saturday evening saw the celebration of the tenth birthday of the organisation , which can already look back on impressive results .
founding Chairman Hen@@ ne reported in depth on the work of the organisation .
in 2004 , he visited the Ch@@ ei@@ jk @-@ Z@@ aj@@ ed Hospital in Nou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ott in Mauritania for the first time .
as a result , an important collaboration was developed and the gyn@@ a@@ ec@@ ologist , Han@@ ne , has performed countless operations on several journeys to the location .
during the speech , images from the trips were shown on a large screen , in order to give the guests at the anniversary event an insight into the initiatives mentioned .
the organisation &apos;s desert vehicle was also shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
Rainer Pre@@ wo , the former Lord Mayor of Nag@@ old , made the suggestion of equipping this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and , according to Hen@@ ne , he is now planning to assume an advisory role within the organisation .
in 2008 , the Schle@@ eh carp@@ entry company from Ba@@ ier@@ s@@ bronn built the hospital station in So@@ co@@ g@@ im , a poor district on the edge of the Capital , in the record time of less than one week - free of charge .
Hen@@ ne also mentioned a new mother and child hospital in Nou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ott
this is particularly interesting at a time when Nag@@ old is set to do away with its maternity clinic .
you learn a great deal working as a doctor in Africa , said Hen@@ ne , for example that you should slow down to avoid burn @-@ out .
due to the political unrest in the country , it has not been possible to make as many journeys as planned , but for this reason , many local doctors have come to Germany , to sit in on lectures on a variety of topics .
in addition , containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa , for example in March of this year when medical devices , medicines , band@@ aging material , hospital beds and spectacles were sent .
co @-@ initiator Hans @-@ Joachim Fu@@ cht@@ el himself provided plenty of local colour , telling of Mercedes vehicles in Mauritania converted into mobile goat stalls and sharing the experiences of the Stamm@@ heim musicians , who traditionally support the organisation on their trips to Mauritania .
he identified his personal motivation as being his work in the area of auditing as a young member of parliament .
when it became clear to him how much money is wasted , he decided to help the Africans with controlling of their budget by the people .
Fu@@ cht@@ el also emphasised that a global economy requires global human kindness .
the fact that Africa lies closer than many think should by no means be forgotten .
Africa is not at all that far from Gran Canaria .
Coul@@ son used phone hacking to verify tip
former News of the World editor Andy Coul@@ son allegedly used &quot; phone hacking , surveillance and confrontation &quot; in an attempt to confirm a bog@@ us tip about an affair involving then @-@ home secretary Charles Clarke .
prosecutor Andrew Edi@@ s QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rum@@ our in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his &quot; attractive special adviser , &quot; Hannah Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by .
the newspaper tasked private investig@@ ator Glenn Mul@@ c@@ aire with hacking Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s vo@@ ic@@ emails and &quot; door @-@ stepped &quot; her , but Coul@@ son also called and left her vo@@ ic@@ emails , the court heard .
&quot; the prosecution suggests that Mr Coul@@ son , who is now the editor of the Not@@ W , he is not the man who stands outside people &apos;s houses hoping to catch them out , he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say , &quot; Mr Edi@@ s said .
he said the Not@@ W used three ways to investigate stories : phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .
the editor is personally involved in the third .
obviously he knows about the second , surveillance , he must do .
what about the first ?
does he know about phone hacking ?
he says he doesn &apos;t , we say &quot; Oh yes , he did . &quot;
rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the Not@@ W &apos;s features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by was told : &quot; don &apos;t bother wasting your time , she &apos;s with Charles . &quot;
a tape of vo@@ ic@@ emails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mul@@ c@@ aire &apos;s home in August 2006 .
investigators also found entries on the private investig@@ ator &apos;s computer which had Ms Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and her sister as &quot; Projects . &quot;
during the period she was being investigated , Ms Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her , Mr Edi@@ s said .

in protest against the planned tax on the rich , the French Football Association is set to actually go through with the first strike since 1972 .
a mediation meeting comes to an end without resolution .
in the conflict regarding the tax on the wealthy , the government and the professional football association in France have manoeu@@ v@@ red into a cu@@ l @-@ de @-@ sac following a failed mediation meeting .
President François Hollande welcomed club and association representatives to Paris &apos; É@@ lys@@ ée Palace on Thursday , where he listened to their complaints .
however , he refused to spare the football association from the planned 75 % income tax to be imposed on those earning in excess of one million € per year , which every company in the country will have to pay for two years , from 2014 .
the opposition also remained adam@@ ant .
the strike announced for the end of November will now go ahead , informed the head of the Union of Professional Football Clubs ( UC@@ PF ) , Jean @-@ Pierre Lou@@ vel .
the Lig@@ ue 1 and Lig@@ ue 2 match days scheduled between 29 November and 2 December will thus be cancelled .
G@@ ech@@ ingen : absolute protection not possible
&quot; we want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possible , &quot; said Mayor Jens H@@ äuß@@ ler , opening the citizen &apos;s information event regarding the flood protection concept in G@@ ech@@ ingen .
around 80 participants came to the Gemeinde@@ halle ( community hall ) to have the planned measures explained to them , to express their concerns and submit ideas .
H@@ äuß@@ ler made clear : &quot; the final decisions will be made by the members of the Town Council . &quot;
H@@ äuß@@ ler commented that the flood that found G@@ ech@@ ingen un@@ prepared on 15 May 2009 , was a decisive event in raising the question of protective measures for the future .
a river basin study was commissioned in collaboration with the neighbouring community of A@@ id@@ lingen , which now forms the basis for the flood protection concept in G@@ ech@@ ingen .
&quot; the goal is the protection of as many developed plots of land as possible , &quot; said H@@ äuß@@ ler .
the basis for the plans is the need for protection against expected floods , which statistically occurs every 100 years , according to the German Weather Service .
climate change is taken into account in the form of an allowance of 15 per cent .
in expert circles this is referred to as &quot; HQ 100@@ a@@ Klima . &quot;
the masses of water that caused considerable damage in G@@ ech@@ ingen in 2009 was equivalent to a 1,000 @-@ year flood .
&quot; there is no such thing as absolute protection , but we can attempt to make a relative improvement , &quot; said H@@ äuß@@ ler .
in order to achieve HQ 100@@ a@@ Klima protection , around four million € must be invested in G@@ ech@@ ingen , whereby the town can count on a State subsidy of around 70 per cent .
however , H@@ äuß@@ ler indicated that the funding would only be provided if an overall concept is developed .
in order to develop such a concept , the town is reliant on the cooperation of its citizens .
a complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .
in a best case scenario , implementation could begin in 2016 .
among other measures , the protection concept , which ( we reported ) has already been presented to the Town Council during the past week , plans local measures in the tribut@@ ary to the River Ir@@ m , running from the Stamm@@ heim Valley .
in conjunction with the presentation of the flood protection concept , the participants made use of the opportunity to submit their concerns .
among others , the question was raised as to why em@@ bank@@ ments and detention reservoirs are no longer planned to protect the location .
Gregor Küh@@ n , technical planner at the commissioned engineering company , Hügel@@ sheim @-@ based &apos; Wald und Cor@@ be &apos; , who presented the concept , emphasised that it required the interplay of all proposed measures , in order that their sum might achieve the desired goal .
furthermore , the most economic solution must be found , said Joachim Wald of Wald und Cor@@ be .
there was resentment among local residents of the old town , who have repeatedly to suffer as a result of the over@@ flowing of the canal network , even during normal thunder@@ storms .
the problem is known to the administrative department and initial measures have already been taken .
however , H@@ äuß@@ ler indicated that the guidelines for canal systems are different to those for flood protection , and these must not be confused .
the town is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that it can withstand rainfall events every two to three years .
to make the se@@ wer@@ age channels wider would gob@@ ble up millions .
persons seriously injured following collision
early on Friday afternoon , two car drivers were seriously injured in a head @-@ on collision on Landes@@ straße 44 ( a rural road ) .
the police completely blocked off the road immediately , but initially could not make much comment on the cause of the accident .
however , they did mention that there were various witness statements that first had to be assessed .
what is certain is that the 19 @-@ year @-@ old female driver of a VW Golf was driving in the direction of Rev@@ ens@@ dorf and the 38 @-@ year @-@ old man from G@@ ett@@ orf came towards her in his Hy@@ un@@ dai .
the two vehicles colli@@ ded , whereby the woman was so severely stuck that it took the fire service almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck@@ age .
initially the actual cause of the accident remained unclear .
both unfortunate parties were taken to nearby hospitals .
the road remained fully blocked off for around two hours .
you could call him the Do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky of the USA .
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker , a metaphysi@@ cian , and to a certain extent his novels and stories also feature recurring themes .
the external li@@ ken@@ ess is astounding : the pier@@ cing eyes , the be@@ ard , the high foreh@@ ead .
and so , as F@@ y@@ odor M. Do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky - with his massive oeuvre - is considered the reve@@ aler and apolog@@ ist of the Russian soul , Philip K. Dick is considered an American prophet , who is certainly highly esteemed within his own native country .
some titles have been released by the He@@ yne Verlag publishing house , the &apos; H@@ aff@@ man &apos;s cassette &apos; featuring 118 stories was distributed by Zwei@@ tau@@ dens@@ eins .
Dick illustrates America - the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress , paired with parano@@ ia , a fix@@ ation on security and the belief of having been chosen .
Dick had &apos; God experiences &apos; , and his later books read like a mixture of the Book of Rev@@ el@@ ation and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , or perhaps drugs had affected his brain .
he realised , early on , that computers are divin@@ ities .
he wrote a &apos; The@@ ology of the Computer &apos; and questioned what separates humans from the machine , the creator from the creation .
that is the &quot; Blade Runner &quot; problem .
killing .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have inspired film producers such as Rid@@ ley Scott , Paul Ver@@ ho@@ even and Steven Spiel@@ berg .
the latter story is now particularly significant .
&quot; minority Report &quot; originates from the year 1956 , and exu@@ des the scent of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal .
here the principle of the &quot; Pre @-@ Crime &quot; is developed , i.e. something that is now more or less official doctrine within the White House .
in Dick &apos;s world , which is alarm@@ ingly similar to our own , mut@@ ants look into the future - and the police have access to this insight .
&quot; we arrest individuals who &apos;ve broken no law , &quot; says the government official .
&quot; we get to them first , before they can commit an act of violence . &quot;
and : &quot; in our society we have no major crimes , but we do have a detention camp full of would @-@ be criminals . &quot; they read time streams .
they assume that bad things are going to happen and prevent the criminal thought turning into action .
Dick &apos;s tale acts as a blueprint for the anti @-@ terror laws and the phone tapping madness of the N@@ SA .
anticipation of attack : this is also how Obama &apos;s drone philosophy and practices work .
however , Dick &apos;s story is not yet finished .
the Police Chief argues that there is no more division of power , the military controls daily life - and what is left of the State .
then the wat@@ cher is himself being watched and is convicted of a future crime .
the system slips up .
it is perfect , but it lies .
it devis@@ es its own conditions .
it not only accepts errors and victims , but builds itself on them .
the system creates the threat that it is fighting against .
to read Philip K. Dick means to get closer to the truth , time and time again .
issuing statements regarding the Merkel sp@@ ying scandal from Russia
the former US intelligence expert , Edward Snow@@ den , may make further statements regarding the US espionage scandal involving Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , from his Russian asylum .
representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office could either submit questions in writing or meet the 30 @-@ year @-@ old in person in Russia , reported the Inter@@ fax Agency .
green Party parliament representative , Hans @-@ Christian Strö@@ bel@@ e , was yesterday the first German politician to meet with Snow@@ den in Moscow , to discuss the scandal with him .
N@@ SA revelations boost corporate parano@@ ia about state surveillance
on a mild day in late August a German police helicopter bu@@ z@@ zed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt , the financial capital of Germany .
on the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ F@@ V ) , Germany &apos;s domestic intelligence agency , its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost , which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank .
German media say the B@@ F@@ V hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin .
James cl@@ apper , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities &quot; to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line . &quot;
but ever since Edward Snow@@ den , the contractor turned whist@@ leb@@ lower , began releasing his treasure tro@@ ve of US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word .
reports that the US National Security Agency spi@@ ed on Brazilian oil company Petro@@ bras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have rat@@ ch@@ eted corporate parano@@ ia about state surveillance to new high@@ s .
the final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s phone had been bu@@ gged , possibly for about a decade .
if Europe &apos;s most powerful person can be targeted , then surely business leaders are also potential targets .
Snow@@ den has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies .
I think it &apos;s conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit .
&quot; Germany must wake up , &quot; says Oliver Grün , president of BIT@@ Mi , which represents small and medium sized German IT companies .
German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , according to a survey published in July by EY , the consultancy .
in all the documentation leaked by Mr Snow@@ den , there has , however , been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies &apos; trade secrets to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US .
business leaders are sceptical about this .
someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google .
I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again ...
&quot; that &apos;s not the way , &quot; H@@ asso Plat@@ tner , chairman of German business software company SAP , says .
if one wanted a strong European IT industry , then one shouldn &apos;t have let it die out 20 years ago .
everything is subsidised in Germany , from coal , to cars and farmers .
everything but the IT industry .
still , the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snow@@ den revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China .
a big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance , a trade body , some 10 per cent of non @-@ US members cancelled plans to use a US @-@ based cloud provider after revelations about the US Pris@@ m data mining programme .
Jim Sn@@ abe , co @-@ chief executive at SAP , says : &quot; we see a new question from customers that didn &apos;t come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction . &quot;
many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew : that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs .
that economic sp@@ ying takes place is not a surprise .
it has always taken place .
&quot; this has been a topic for many years and hasn &apos;t fundamentally changed through the current discussion , &quot; says Kurt Bock , chief executive of chemical maker BASF .
the Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the counter@@ measures they have taken , in case this hands an advantage to an attacker .
for large companies , the message has long since been dru@@ mmed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair , or leaving a laptop ung@@ u@@ arded in a hotel room are unwise , to say the least .
Ulrich Hack@@ enberg , board member at car@@ maker Audi , says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices .
Germany &apos;s B@@ F@@ V advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised .
the prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards .
however , there is concern that small and medium @-@ sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance .
in Germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche .
&quot; small and medium sized companies often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access , &quot; the B@@ F@@ V warns in a report .
the US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries .
the US National Intelligence E@@ stim@@ ate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence , behind China , according to The Washington Post .
a board member at a German blue @-@ chip company conc@@ urred that when it comes to economic espionage , &quot; the French are the worst . &quot;
Bernard S@@ quar@@ c@@ ini , former head of the French internal intelligence agency D@@ CR@@ I , was quoted in an interview this month as saying : &quot; the services know perfectly well that all countries , even as they co @-@ operate in the anti@@ terrorist fight , spy on their allies . &quot;
H@@ ech@@ ingen : trade fair provides the answers to wedding questions
&quot; marriage is and remains the most important journey of discovery a person can undertake , &quot; said the philosopher S@@ ören K@@ ier@@ k@@ eg@@ aard .
tips , at least as to how the wedding celebration can be a success , have now been given at a special trade fair in the Domäne in H@@ ech@@ ingen .
important suppliers of all wedding @-@ related products and services were represented .
a trend : the retro look is back once again .
this begins with the wedding clothing .
white is a must , best mut@@ ed or in cream .
at the front , dresses with numerous ru@@ ffles and embroidery are in , often with a veil , while to the rear they run down the back and often end in a train .
however , opinions differ , as Stef@@ anie Koch from the Mode@@ haus Kleider@@ müller emphasised .
for men , suits with a wa@@ ist@@ coat and nec@@ ker@@ chief are most popular , although some people do choose cream or brown combinations .
selecting the venue is important , it was explained .
plain adjoining rooms are not ideal , the ambience should be special .
in this regard , the Domäne drew attention to their own facilities in the carriage house .
Uwe Link has an offer for anyone who wants to set off in a carriage .
&quot; however , carriages are also popular for hen parties , &quot; he commented .
people were also on the lookout for romantic ideas for invitations , flower arrangements and wedding photographs .
the &quot; After @-@ Wedding Photo &quot; is becoming increasingly fashionable - that is , series of pictures taken a few days after the celebration , at special locations , preferably in front of waterfalls or the like , but in full wedding clothing , explained Elisabeth Kei@@ del .
many other details for a successful wedding were presented in the Domäne on Sunday .
flower arrangements , rings , wedding tables , cakes and also a mag@@ ician , such as Marko Ri@@ pper@@ ger , who can entertain guests with style .
the correct cosmetics and nail care must@@ n &apos;t be forgotten .
everything you need for an unforgettable celebration .

parents of Georgia teen who died in &apos; fre@@ ak accident &apos; believe son was murdered
the parents of a Georgia teenager , whose body was found inside a rolled @-@ up wrestling mat in his high school gym , believe their son was murdered , the family &apos;s attorney said Thursday .
K@@ end@@ rick Johnson , of Val@@ do@@ sta , G@@ a . , was found Jan@@ . 11 stuck in an upright mat pro@@ pped behind the ble@@ achers inside his high school gym .
L@@ own@@ des County sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s investigators concluded Johnson died in a fre@@ ak accident , but the 17 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s family disputes that .
&quot; they absolutely think their son was murdered , &quot; Benjamin C@@ rum@@ p , an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacqu@@ el@@ yn Johnson , told Fox@@ New@@ s.@@ com.
they never believed he died the way the sh@@ eri@@ ff concluded .
&quot; they believe that it de@@ fies logic , the laws of physics as well as common sense , &quot; C@@ rum@@ p said .
they think this is a cover @-@ up to protect the person or people responsible for their son &apos;s death .
&quot; they sent their son to school with a book @-@ bag and he was returned to them in a body bag , &quot; he said .
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson &apos;s death , noting that several key questions remain unanswered .
what was the cause of death ?
was his death the result of a crime ?
Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon .
I will follow the facts wherever they lead .
my objective is to discovery the truth .
&quot; I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists &quot; for a formal investigation , he said .
Moore told reporters that the initial autop@@ sy indicated Johnson died as a result of &quot; positional as@@ phy@@ xia . &quot;
a second autop@@ sy , however , listed a different cause of death , according to Moore .
&quot; there are several questions that must be answered or confirmed , &quot; he said .
Moore added that if he un@@ covers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it .
a representative from the L@@ own@@ des County Sher@@ i@@ ff &apos;s Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday .
a southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators reviewed .
the teenager &apos;s parents said they hope the video footage will contain clues to how he died .
CDC issues children &apos;s allergy guidelines for schools
on Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children &apos;s food allergies at school .
this is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out , as the number of school @-@ age children suffering from food allergies climbs .
one in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies .
the CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 .
the guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children &apos;s food allergies , and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur .
it also recommends schools have ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine stocked -- the Epi@@ Pen brand auto @-@ inj@@ ector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ xis .
state legislat@@ ures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine more easily .
the report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction .
kids may say , &quot; It feels like something is po@@ king my tongue , &quot; &quot; My tongue feels like there is hair on it , &quot; or &quot; My tongue is ting@@ ling . &quot;
parents of inter@@ sex Kids Can Pick &apos; Gender Un@@ determin@@ ed@@ &apos;
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous gen@@ italia .
no longer will new@@ bor@@ ns be rigi@@ dly assigned to male or female .
the new law doesn &apos;t require parents to declare any gender for such children , allowing parents to declare gender &quot; und@@ et@@ ermin@@ ed &quot; or &quot; un@@ specified &quot; on their birth certificates .
the aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex @-@ assignment surgery for new@@ bor@@ ns , and to fight discrimination against those who are inter@@ sex .
one inter@@ sex person , according to the BBC , said years later , &quot; I am neither a man nor a woman . &quot;
I will remain the patchwork created by doctors , bru@@ ised and scar@@ red .
an estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl .
they are inter@@ sex , part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development , an umbrella term for those with atypical chromo@@ som@@ es , gon@@ ads ( o@@ varies or testes ) , or unusually developed gen@@ italia .
Wallis Simpson may have been inter@@ sex .
gender identification is still not well understood , but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined , it &apos;s better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child &apos;s psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery , if at all .
new York City psychiat@@ rist Dr. Jack Dres@@ cher , who specializes in issues of gender identification , said the new German law &quot; sounds like a good thing . &quot;
inter@@ sex children pose ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people have life @-@ endangering conditions that require surgery , but most kids do not , &quot; he said .
you can make a gender assignment without surgery , and then see how identity develops .
the science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate .
nobody can answer the questions about why this happens .
it &apos;s like the mystery of why people are gay .
a report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described inter@@ sex people as different from trans@@ sexual or trans@@ gender people , as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup , which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female , but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either .
these features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics , such as muscle mass , hair distribution , breasts and stature ; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and gen@@ italia ; or in chromo@@ somal structures and hormones .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by inter@@ sex and trans@@ gender people in the realm of employment , as well as levels of harassment , violence and bias crimes .
gender non@@ conforming boys now have special camp .
already , Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male , female or a &quot; third gender &quot; on their official documents .
in June , a 52 @-@ year @-@ old Australian , Nor@@ rie May @-@ Wel@@ by , became the world &apos;s first recognized &quot; gen@@ der@@ less &quot; person after winning a legal appeal to keep an &quot; un@@ specified &quot; gender status for life .
German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X , for inter@@ sex , according to the Interior Ministry .
in neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news report on France 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of French law@@ makers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for &quot; gender theory &quot; to be withdrawn from school textbooks .
the U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law , writing that &quot; as the world is being dragged into a new state , where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , we reverse two more pillars of civilization . &quot;
one Maryland mother of a new@@ born also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth .
&quot; par@@ enting is stressful enough without extra limitations , especially if you don &apos;t know the gender of your child , &quot; she told the par@@ enting website .
children need stability and certainty .
historically , children born with both male and female gen@@ italia were called her@@ ma@@ ph@@ ro@@ di@@ tes , named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality .
and as little as a decade ago , the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then re@@ drawn .
but now , many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery , knowing that gender identity is complex , and doctors can sometimes get it wrong , not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up .
&quot; back in the middle of the 20th century , it was called a &apos; psychiatric emergency , &apos; &quot; said Dres@@ cher .
when these kids were born , you didn &apos;t call the psychiat@@ rist , you called a surgeon .
the prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous gen@@ italia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Joh@@ ns Hopkins University , who held that gender was mal@@ le@@ able .
he coined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that social and environmental cu@@ es -- how parents raised a child -- inter@@ acted with a child &apos;s genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female .
but in one 1966 case , known as &quot; John / Joan , &quot; his theories became controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been sever@@ ed in a bot@@ ched circum@@ c@@ ision to have the child fully ca@@ str@@ ated , removing his tes@@ tic@@ les , as well , and to raise him as a girl .
&quot; money presented the case as a successful case of transition , but it was not , &quot; said Dres@@ cher .
when the boy was around 15 , he transi@@ tioned back to a boy and married a woman .
but at 38 , he committed suicide .
Dres@@ cher said that now some doctors are still &quot; practicing that model . &quot;
but in the 1990s , with the advent of the Internet , survivors of these gender sur@@ geries have come forward &quot; not happy with the outcome . &quot;
such was the case with Jim Bruce , a 36 @-@ year @-@ old writer from Montana , who was born with XY male chromo@@ som@@ es but ambiguous gen@@ itals .
doctors couldn &apos;t be sure if he had a large cl@@ it@@ or@@ is or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a &quot; satisfactory life &quot; as a man .
so shortly after his birth in 1976 , Bruce &apos;s external organ and testes were surg@@ ically removed and he was raised as a girl .
he was given female hormones at age 12 .
&quot; I knew that I wasn &apos;t a girl , &quot; he told AB@@ C@@ New@@ s.@@ com.
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at 18 , he was set for a vag@@ in@@ op@@ last@@ y .
but depressed and knowing something was wrong , he demanded medical records .
what he found out was hor@@ rifying .
I was steri@@ lized at birth -- and no one ever told me .
Bruce was born with a DS@@ D that prevented his body from producing enough test@@ oster@@ one to properly develop his gen@@ itals .
after learning the truth , he changed back to a man , taking test@@ oster@@ one shots and having his breasts removed .
surgery rendered him infer@@ tile .
today , he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project , trying to norm@@ alize perceptions of those who are inter@@ sex .
but Anne Tam@@ ar @-@ Mat@@ tis , executive director for California @-@ based legal group Advoc@@ ates for Inform@@ ed Choice , worries that the German law &quot; invites labeling and stig@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; a lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an &apos; und@@ et@@ ermin@@ ed , &apos; &quot; she said .
we are afraid it will encourage intervention .
we think a better process is assigning male or female sex , then waiting .
but we haven &apos;t seen how the law will play out , so all we can do is speculate .
Tam@@ ar @-@ Mat@@ tis said that her organization supports the Australian law because &quot; it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender . &quot;
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender , &quot; she said .
German law is about assigning it at birth .
that is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point .
when they are grown , they can make decisions about their own bodies .
but Dr. Ar@@ lene Bar@@ atz , a Pittsburgh breast radi@@ ologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group , said the German law will &quot; empower &quot; both parents and children .
Bar@@ atz &apos;s daughter K@@ atie was born with male chromo@@ som@@ es , but has a DS@@ D called complete and@@ rogen in@@ sensitivity syndrome .
because her and@@ rogen recept@@ ors are faulty , K@@ atie developed female characteristics .
she has a vag@@ ina , but no uter@@ us or o@@ varies .
now at 29 , K@@ atie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania , a resident in child psychiat@@ ry .
though she is infer@@ tile , she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gest@@ ational sur@@ rog@@ acy .
&quot; the law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves , &quot; said Bar@@ atz .
it gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female . &apos;
this way , you are OK -- raise the child , love the child .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun .
we don &apos;t have to rush into surgery that is irreversible .
&quot; it brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motiv@@ ates parents because they don &apos;t feel they are doing the right thing , &quot; she said .
ultimately , the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that &apos;s a wonderful thing .
it em@@ powers children to make the decision for themselves .
unknown attackers inj@@ ure girl with shots fired from car
unknown attackers have injured a twelve @-@ year @-@ old girl in Saxony @-@ Anhalt when firing shots from a car .
the ass@@ ail@@ ants fired on a group of children on Thursday evening in G@@ enth@@ in , presumably with an air gun .
this was announced by the police in Burg .
the girl suffered minor injury to her left calf .
rescue workers took the girl to the hospital .
the shots came from a small car , which drove past a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the ass@@ ail@@ ants also fired shots at a bus stop .
a pane of glass was shattered .
they then drove away .
the Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department is investigating the matter , it was stated on Friday .
thus far , the Kemp@@ ten Police Department can look back on a calm Halloween night .
the authorities were only called out twice to deal with children throwing eggs against houses .
because the home owners realised this immediately , the egg remnants could be cleaned off at once , meaning that no material damage occurred .
furthermore , in the town centre area , while a few fireworks were set off , no material damage was caused here either .
the residents of the Bischof @-@ Freund@@ or@@ fer @-@ Weg reported that a car was wrapped in toilet paper and its wheel tri@@ ms stolen .
however , the man found all his wheel tri@@ ms nearby prior to the police arriving , on account of which no further police involvement was required .
living with a future @-@ oriented perspective
if truth be told , Wal@@ trau@@ d Ries , lives a dre@@ amy life .
her house is located in a peaceful neighbourhood in Stuttgart , with plenty of greenery , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
she is only a few minutes from the city centre using public transport .
&quot; hopefully you aren &apos;t afraid of spi@@ ders ? &quot; asks Wal@@ trau@@ d Ries , pointing out a large spi@@ der on the door frame .
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself for some time now .
but you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart .
however , the reason for the desire to move is not ar@@ ach@@ n@@ ophobia , but rather the fear of not being able to manage the large number of steps up to their house , and inside their home in their old age , she explained .
furthermore : since undergoing a men@@ is@@ cus operation , the lady , in her mid @-@ fif@@ ties , has had to experience for herself what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability .
only recently , she released a book on the subject of &quot; Living happily in old age - Which type of property is the best for me ? . &quot;
&quot; our home is the best example of a property that simply doesn &apos;t work in old age , &quot; she begins to re@@ count .
when she moved to the ma@@ ison@@ ette with her husband 20 years ago , it was simply just a pretty apartment in green surroundings .
now , in her mid @-@ fif@@ ties , Wal@@ trau@@ d Ries has different thoughts about it .
however , she is aware that she is one of the few people to actually deal with the topic of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
the majority of people put it to the back of their minds for as long as possible .
only other people get old , she says , sm@@ ir@@ king .
only when the psychological strain becomes severe do people give it consideration .
&quot; but at this stage it can be too late , &quot; said Ries .
in her book , the interior decor@@ ator presents 17 housing models for independent living in old age .
&quot; however , which type of residence you choose is always a personal decision , &quot; she explains .
there is no solution to overcoming old age .
even if you can afford to spend your retirement in Tuscany or Brittany , you should always take the fact that you may become ill into consideration .
and : &apos; without a sound knowledge of the local language , you can even become lonely when living the dol@@ ce vita , &apos; added the author , providing food for thought for those seeking to move abroad .
her models include classic care models , alternative living arrangements and the often @-@ mentioned pensioners &apos; living community .
in old age everyone has their quir@@ ks and ti@@ cks .
&apos;@@ However , this type of residential community would not be for me , &apos; she commented with a win@@ k .
definitely nothing like student accommodation with a shared bathroom and kitchen .
&apos;@@ in old age you simply need your own space to withdraw to , &apos; said Ries .
however , the author does not wish to rule out the possibility that a pensioners &apos; residential community can work .
however , it must operate differently to the classic student digs .
and sometimes you also just want your peace and quiet , &apos; she believes .
with this opinion she is at least not alone in the State Capital .
the experience of Ther@@ esa R@@ ütten , head of the citizen &apos;s Life in Old Age service in the State Capital , is also that &apos; the majority of old people in Stuttgart want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible &apos; .
her agency agency advises people on the topic of &apos; growing old &apos; .
therefore the experience of the Stiftung War@@ ent@@ est consumer study is also that elderly people in particular would accept in@@ conveniences and limitations just to be able to remain in their usual environment .
nowadays there are many possibilities for designing the house or apartment in such a way as to be barrier @-@ free .
Ries recommends that all those working on the age @-@ appropriate renovation of their house or apartment first seek out in @-@ depth information and don &apos;t simply use the first trades@@ man that comes along .
nowadays there are specialists in renovation to suit the needs of the elderly .
even in the case of rental apartments some land@@ lords can have this work carried out , even if it is just a matter of raising the level of the toilet seat , clarified the interior designer .
however , it is not always the case that your existing apartment can be made age @-@ appropriate and therefore barrier @-@ free , even if it is as beautiful as ever .
Wal@@ trau@@ d Ries had to go through this experience herself .
you could of course install a st@@ air lift inside the apartment , but the cobbled path up to the door of the apartment , featuring a number of steps would be a much greater hindrance .
she will keep looking until she has found the ideal property for herself and her husband .
she is more afraid of the move than of the spi@@ der on her front door .
the USA still want to prosecute Snow@@ den
the USA have not changed their position regarding the former US Secret Service employee Edward Snow@@ den .
he is still accused of passing on secret information without authorisation .
he must therefore face criminal proceedings in the USA , said the spokesperson for the US Foreign Office , Jennifer P@@ s@@ aki , in Washington .
even the most recent statements from Snow@@ den will not change this fact .
following a recent meeting with Snow@@ den in Moscow , German Green Party politician Hans @-@ Christian Strö@@ bel@@ e appealed to the USA not to continue to threaten him with prosecution .
P@@ s@@ aki emphasised that Strö@@ bel@@ e &apos;s comments were the views of a parliamentarian , and not those of a German government member .
secret Service whist@@ leb@@ lower , Edward Snow@@ den is , in principle , willing to hold a discussion with the German authorities .
however , he first wishes for his situation to be clarified .
this was made clear by the former N@@ SA employee , currently sought by the USA , in an open letter that Green Party politician Hans @-@ Christian Strö@@ bel@@ e made public on Friday following a meeting with Snow@@ den , and passed on to the Federal Government , the Federal Parliament and the Federal Public Prosecutor General .
the letter was pur@@ ported to have been worded as follows :
to whom it may concern ,
I have been invited to write to you regarding your investigation of mass surveillance .
I am Edward Joseph Snow@@ den , formerly employed through contracts or direct hire as a technical expert for the United States National Security Agency , and Defense Intelligence Agency .
in the course of my service to these organizations , I believe I witnessed systemic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act .
as a result of reporting these concerns , I have faced a severe and sustained campaign of persecution that forced me from my family and home .
I am currently living in exile under a grant of temporary asylum in the Russian Federation in accordance with international law .
I am hear@@ tened by the response to my act of political expression , in both the United States and beyond .
citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an un@@ accountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service .
these sp@@ ying revelations have resulted in the proposal of many new laws and policies to address formerly concealed abuses of the public trust .
the benefits to society of this growing knowledge are becoming increasingly clear at the same time that claimed risks are being shown to have been mitig@@ ated .
though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as def@@ ection , and seeks to crimin@@ alize political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no defence .
however , speaking the truth is not a crime .
I am confident that with the support of the international community , the government of the United States will abandon this harmful behaviour .
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved , I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of facts regarding reports in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of documents , as appropriate and in accordance with the law .
I look forward to speaking with you in your country when the situation is resolved , and thank you for your efforts in upholding the international laws that protect us all .

a kindergarten has found a private buyer
&quot; the building is in good hands , &quot; said Winter@@ lingen &apos;s Mayor Michael Mai@@ er .
the local authorities have sold the former Kindergarten on Garten@@ straße to a private buyer .
the Town Council cons@@ ented to the sale in its most recent meeting , during the part of the meeting that was not open to the public .
the building changed hands for an &quot; appropriate &quot; price .
&quot; the local authorities are satisfied , &quot; emphasised Mai@@ er .
EUR 100,000 have been added to the local budget .
it is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former Kindergarten .
the Mayor considers it the right decision that Winter@@ lingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter , and thus will no longer have to pay for the upkeep of the building , such as heating it , tending to the garden and clearing the pavement .
&quot; this expense has now been off@@ loaded , &quot; Mai@@ er was glad to say .

report : Obama campaign considered dumping Bi@@ den for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama &apos;s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Bi@@ den with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket , according to the New York Times .
the revelation is the most notable bomb@@ shell from Mark Hal@@ per@@ in and John Hei@@ lem@@ ann &apos;s heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome , &quot; Double Down : game Change 2012 . &quot;
the Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President &apos;s top ai@@ des conducted &quot; extensive group @-@ sessions and polling in late 2011 &quot; to gauge whether the dumping Bi@@ den could help bolster Obama &apos;s wan@@ ing re @-@ election hopes .
according to the Times &apos; national political correspondent Jonathan Martin , the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House , namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Dal@@ ey , to measure what effect sw@@ apping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls .
the potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the O@@ val Office .
only half a dozen of the President &apos;s closest advisers -- including Dal@@ ey , former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina , and former White House senior advisers David Ax@@ el@@ rod and David Pl@@ ou@@ ffe -- knew the change was under consideration .
&quot; double Down &quot; claims Dal@@ ey spear@@ headed the effort to replace Bi@@ den , despite their &quot; close personal rapport , &quot; before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn &apos;t &quot; materially improve Obama &apos;s odds . &quot;
in an interview with Martin , Dal@@ ey confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Bi@@ den with Clinton .
&quot; I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things , and this was one of them , &quot; Dal@@ ey told the paper .
you have to remember , at that point the President was in awful shape , so we were like , &quot; Holy Christ , what do we do ? &quot;
while Dal@@ ey characterized the research as &quot; due diligence , &quot; Martin told CNN &apos;s Anderson Cooper that the re @-@ election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls .
&quot; campaigns don &apos;t spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they &apos;re seriously considering something , &quot; Martin said on AC@@ 360 .
it &apos;s unclear , however , whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap .
Martin told CNN that he asked Dal@@ ey whether his then @-@ boss knew about the potential shuffle .
while Dal@@ ey said he doesn &apos;t think the President &quot; was aware &quot; of the potential change , the former chief of staff admitted that it &apos;s &quot; possible &quot; Obama knew .
Martin added that &quot; Double Down &quot; does not definitively answer whether the political prob@@ ing reached Obama &apos;s desk .
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Bi@@ den from the ticket .
&quot; possibly , &quot; Martin replied .
what happens with my e @-@ mail when in transit ?
e @-@ mail is short for electronic mail .
are there technical measures to maintain privacy of correspondence , similar to that of the traditional postal service , implemented into the design of this Internet @-@ based service ?
when designing the early Internet services , the focus lay on making communication possible .
thus , when developing the underlying technical protocols , no attention was given to creating a stable foundation for the interception @-@ proof exchange of mail .
for this reason , a traditional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .
when user &quot; Anna &quot; sends an email to &quot; B@@ enn@@ i , &quot; are the pair &apos;s computers then directly connected ?
Anna &apos;s email program or browser first sends the mail to her service provider &apos;s mail server .
if she has a Gmail account , for example , this would be Google .
this mail server sends the content to the provider that B@@ enn@@ i uses .
en route , the mail can pass through any number of other servers on the Internet .
B@@ enn@@ i can then call up the content from his provider .
are traditional e @-@ mails read by third parties on their journey through the net ?
the majority of e @-@ mails are read several times by software robots en route to the recipient .
checks are generally carried out by the sender &apos;s provider as to whether the mail contains malware as an attachment .
a virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems .
in addition , the providers check whether it is nuisance or unwanted spam mail , which are deleted immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder .
do the robots have other tasks ?
in the case of systems such as Gmail , the robots also identify the information that Google requires for displaying context @-@ based advertising .
if Anna and B@@ enn@@ i communicate about their upcoming holiday travels via Gmail , Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers .
do unknown individuals also read the e @-@ mails ?
the probability of unauthorised persons reading a mail is extremely low .
however , theoretically , it is possible .
within companies , administrators are often able to read electronic mail that is sent .
law enforcement authorities and Secret Services also have legal authorisation to interc@@ ept or take note of e @-@ mails .
this may include potential illegal sp@@ ying activities .
is it possible to protect e @-@ mails against being read ?
with an encryption using the Open@@ PGP standard , an e @-@ mail can be effectively protected against being read .
with great technical effort , it is also possible to conceal the metadata of email communication so that it is not even possible to tell who is communicating with whom .
how important are Yahoo and Google within the e @-@ mail market in Germany ?
according to a study conducted by Con@@ vi@@ os Consulting in August 2013 , among the main mail services in private use , Yahoo and Google play only a minor role .
while the number of Yahoo Mail accounts has fallen recently , Google &apos;s Gmail managed to grow considerably .
mother buried in shallow forest grave and pension stolen
when his elderly mother died , a man from Wolfsburg devised a plan .
he buried the deceased in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allowance .
according to police investigations , a 67 @-@ year @-@ old Wolfsburg resident buried his dead mother in the woods in order that he might continue to collect her pension and care allowance .
he first covered up the death of the 89 @-@ year @-@ old and then po@@ ck@@ eted the money for more than a year and a half .
the 67 @-@ year @-@ old must now face charges of fraud , said a spokesperson on Friday .
according to the statement , the man hid the woman in a forest near Helm@@ stedt .
the man was already under suspicion back in May : at that time the fact that medications for his care @-@ reliant mother were no longer required drew suspicion .
the pension@@ er told investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain .
the officials found this strange and so continued to investigate .
it was discovered that the mother and son had lived in the same residence for more than 15 years and that he had cared for her in her final days .
the 67 @-@ year @-@ old finally acknowledged the death of his mother .
according to police , an autop@@ sy showed no evidence of any capital offence .
fancy a glow @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark ice cream ?
a British entrepreneur has created the world &apos;s first glow @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark ice cream - using j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
Charlie Francis has harness@@ ed the fluor@@ escent properties of the marine animal to develop the lumin@@ escent snack .
he came up with the idea after reading a research paper on j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and convinced scientists in China to chem@@ ically recreate the glowing protein .
the ice cream reacts with the e@@ ater &apos;s tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow .
Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .
Charlie , founder of the &quot; L@@ ick Me I &apos;m Del@@ icious &quot; ice cream company , said : &quot; it is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production , so £ 200 gets you about 2@@ g of the stuff . &quot;
the protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH .
so as your mouth war@@ ms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow .
we have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish lumin@@ escence is four times more expensive than gold .
so each sco@@ op costs me around £ 140 .
it tastes pretty good though .
Charlie &apos;s experimental company , based in Bristol , is famed for its unusual flavours including beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .
but his next creation is set to be even more ambitious .
he said : &quot; I really want to develop an invisible ice cream . &quot;
it is inherently impossible because of the refra@@ ction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream , but I reck@@ on we will find a way of doing it .
the ice cream har@@ nesses the fluor@@ escent properties of a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , synthes@@ ized by Chinese scientists
after six match days , T@@ SV Mor@@ sum are yet to score a single point in the Hand@@ ball Association League .
and of all possible times , Ingo Eh@@ ler &apos;s team has a der@@ by match against T@@ SV D@@ aver@@ den tomorrow , which celebrated their first victory last week .
the season begins af@@ resh for us with this match .
&quot; I hope that we finally have our heads clear , &quot; commented Eh@@ lers , remaining cautiously optimistic .
for this match he finally has his complete squad available , with the exception of Hend@@ rick Blo@@ h@@ me who is out with long @-@ term injury .
like us , D@@ aver@@ den place emphasis on high tempo play .
for this reason , we must keep our errors to a minimum .
however , the top priority is to improve our cover play , which has recently left much to be desired .
D@@ aver@@ den &apos;s coach Thomas Pan@@ itz comes across as much more relaxed following his team &apos;s first victory of the season against Nord@@ horn .
the match was of course a indication of what we are capable of .
however , it by no means makes us favourites , as anything can happen in the der@@ by .
nonetheless , Pan@@ itz is now looking to come up with the goods in Mor@@ sum and thus start a winning stre@@ ak .
Jan @-@ Mal@@ te J@@ od@@ at will not be playing .
thus , A @-@ Youth player J@@ oo@@ st Wind@@ ß@@ uß , who plays an active part for A @-@ Youth League team HC Bremen , will be celebrating his season dé@@ but .
anyone who is not fired up for a game like this should stay at home .
Halloween 2013 : by the Numbers
when I was little , Halloween was magical .
my sister and I were allowed to eat candy , stay up late and play dress @-@ up for the neighborhood .
nowadays , I &apos;ve become more of a sc@@ roo@@ ge .
I haven &apos;t signed up for the past two years to give out candy in my apartment and probably won &apos;t this year .
but stats show that I &apos;m a black sheep when it comes to Halloween .
the majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 billion on candy , costumes and decorations , according to the National Retail Federation .
one thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends .
costumes are expected to account for $ 1.2 billion dollars out of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the N@@ RF .
this year , sexy in@@ anim@@ ate objects are all the rage .
women don &apos;t have to be sexy professionals anymore ; they can also be sexy foods like pizza , ham@@ bur@@ gers and car@@ rots .
as for men , I expect we will be seeing a lot of zom@@ bies , thanks to The Walking Dead and I &apos;ll bet the D@@ aft Punk space men will make it into our Inst@@ ag@@ ram feeds this year .
according to Google , the highest searched costumes are zom@@ bies , Batman , pirates and wit@@ ches .
I guess there &apos;s nothing wrong with going traditional .
we dressed our dogs up last year and to my amaz@@ ement we were not alone .
in fact , Americans will spend $ 330 million on pet costumes this year , according to the N@@ RF .
that &apos;s a lot of ironic Hot@@ dog dogs .
when it comes to candy , we don &apos;t screw around .
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion on it this year , according to The Nielsen Company .
that &apos;s around 600 million pounds worth of Her@@ sh@@ ey bars , l@@ ol@@ li@@ pops , Mil@@ k du@@ ds , Twi@@ zz@@ lers and Clark Bars .
that &apos;s great news for the 41 million trick @-@ or @-@ Tre@@ aters set to take over our neighborhoods , according to the U.S. Commerce Department .
in fact , we will buy and , who are we kid@@ ding , consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween .
the one thing we don &apos;t want to consume , candy corn ; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National Conf@@ ection@@ ers Association .
that &apos;s about 9 billion individual kernels of corn .
it &apos;s a mystery I have yet to solve .
nothing is more quint@@ essentially Halloween than ha@@ unted houses .
they have the best names , like &quot; Terror Beh@@ ind the Walls &quot; ( which , by the way is in an actual prison ) , &quot; How@@ l @-@ O @-@ Scre@@ am &quot; and &quot; The House of Sho@@ ck . &quot;
in fact , there are 1,200 officially sanctioned ha@@ unted houses in the United States generating about $ 500 million in revenue , according to America ha@@ unts , and that includes those awesome photos of you mid @-@ pe@@ eing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can &apos;t take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like &quot; nice face . &quot;
finally , let &apos;s talk pump@@ kins .
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pump@@ kin when we were kids , and carving a jack @-@ o @-@ lan@@ tern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it &apos;s something we &apos;ve done since we were little .
lucky for us , the &quot; baby in a pump@@ kin trend &quot; started only last year thanks to P@@ interest , so most of us grew up carving these gour@@ ds not sitting in them .
this year , Americans will spend around $ 106 million on pump@@ kins , according to the U.S. Cen@@ sus Bureau .
the jack @-@ o @-@ lan@@ tern slowly wi@@ thering on your front porch probably came from Illinois , which grew 5@@ 42 million pounds of pump@@ kin this year .
if you &apos;re looking for extra credit , call Tim and Susan Math@@ is@@ don in N@@ apa , Cal@@ if . , and try to car@@ ve up their 2,0@@ 32 pound pump@@ kin .
House fire in Hel@@ mb@@ rechts : rescue services retrieve char@@ red body
the fire service were called out to Hel@@ mb@@ rechts late on Thursday evening .
a three @-@ bedroom house in the district of Hof catches fire during the night .
rescue workers retrieve a char@@ red body from the house .
during a fire in Hel@@ mb@@ rechts , rescue services found a char@@ red body in a three @-@ bedroom house .
whether this person was living in the house is as yet unclear , said a police spokesperson in Bayreuth .
late on Thursday evening , fire broke out on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire service arrived , the flames were already bursting out of a window .
rescue workers entered the premises and found the body in a bedroom .
this and another bedroom were completely burnt out .
the entire ground floor suffered damage .
there were no other residents at home during the fire , continued the police spokesperson .
for the time being , the house is no longer hab@@ itable .
the precise cause of the fire was initially unclear .
Germany &apos;s largest national church has launched a campaign advertising the minister &apos;s position .
this comes at the same time as a possible shortage of ministers : the Protestant Luther@@ an Regional Church of Hanover calculates that , as things stand , the current number of around 1,@@ 800 past@@ ors will be halved by 2030 .
for the young people of today , the career is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Pastor Ma@@ this Bur@@ fien ( 43 ) in a conversation with the Protestant Press Service .
it is attractive to be able to determine your own daily working routine .
with Bur@@ fien , the regional church has for first time commissioned a minister to work full time , endeavouring to inspire young people to study theology .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study theology after their Abitur examinations ( equivalent to A levels ) .
Bur@@ fien puts this down to the process of secular@@ isation : &quot; God &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud . &quot;
the job is characterised by great freedom and variety .
I am the master of my own schedule and can therefore turn my focus to what is important to me .
as pastoral workers , ministers can be close to people .
they earn as much as teachers and can make a good living .
of course wages are higher within the private sector , but on the other hand , the@@ ologi@@ ans have a secure employer .
this would suit the young people of today , as it is not just about your career , but about having a meaningful job as well .
according to information from the Regional Church , which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 past@@ ors retire every year .
at the same time , around 40 theology graduates begin as vic@@ ars .
in future it may be difficult to fill positions in sparsely populated outlying areas such as Harz , Em@@ s@@ land or Wend@@ land .
among other initiatives , Bur@@ fien wants to organise study days for young people , inviting famous faces who have studied theology .
theology courses offer broad training .
you can even become Federal President with a theology degree .
land Rover rally series announced

options include upgraded brakes , a service package providing access to Bow@@ ler Works mechanics , logistic support , and vehicle storage between events .
drew Bow@@ ler , the managing director of Bow@@ ler Motorsport , said : &quot; rally customers coming to Bow@@ ler have changed . &quot;
they &apos;re not all experienced rac@@ ers , but people looking for excitement and adventure , and an achievable path towards world @-@ class events .
we &apos;re delighted to be offering this path in partnership with Land Rover and the M@@ SA , and believe the format offers a new way to experience different rally disciplines in the UK and overseas , and prepare entrants for the ri@@ go@@ urs and realities of Rally R@@ aid .
we &apos;ve really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it &apos;ll be a really fun championship .
additionally , the Defender Challenge will provide a training and test day in February , as well as the option to compete in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East .
fire crews called to rescue lost puppy after she got stuck 50@@ ft above the ground on precarious ledge in a quarry
Co@@ cker span@@ iel Ruby had run off after she was in a minor road crash
she was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the quarry
fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters ab@@ seil down cliff face to plu@@ ck the dog from certain death
a puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50@@ ft up on a precarious cliff ledge .
nine month @-@ old co@@ cker span@@ iel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .
her owners Scott Al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his girlfriend Beck@@ y Hall , 20 , were at Fl@@ app@@ it Quar@@ ry in Den@@ hol@@ me , West Yorkshire , to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .
they had searched fran@@ tically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident .
at around 2.@@ 15@@ pm on Wednesday , an eagle @-@ eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry , stranded 50@@ ft up .
a Technical Rescue Team from Cl@@ eck@@ he@@ aton Fire Station rushed to the scene and ab@@ sei@@ led down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff .
specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy C@@ lay@@ ton said : &apos; she was in a precarious situation .
she was right in the middle of the cliff face - 50@@ ft from the top and bottom .
she did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was frozen solid .
but she is fine now .
she was eating biscuits afterwards .
this was a very unusual call @-@ out .
the fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable .
specialist Technical Rescue Officer Peter L@@ au said : &quot; Ruby had a very lucky escape . &quot;
the potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse .
Ruby was taken to the vets for a check @-@ up and was found to be fine other than exhaustion and de@@ hydr@@ ation .
miss Hall , from Hali@@ fax , West Yorkshire , said : &quot; watching the rescue was terrifying . &quot;
I could not believe that she was up there in the first place .
it was amazing to get her back in our arms .
the vet said that if she became too exhausted and collapsed she would probably have fallen .
the fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters were amazing .
it was really daring what they did .
we are just so grateful and every single one of them was absolutely tremendous .
Mr Al@@ der@@ son , from K@@ eigh@@ ley , added : &quot; we were scared that she might fall but she stayed there . &quot;
the fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters were brilliant .
I just can &apos;t believe where she was .
M@@ ick Jag@@ ger says he never hit on K@@ aty Perry when she was 18 .
during an interview with an Australian radio show this week , the pop star said she sang backing vocals for Jag@@ ger &apos;s 2004 song &quot; Old Hab@@ its Die Hard . &quot;
Perry said she had dinner with the veteran ro@@ cker and that &quot; he hit on me when I was 18 . &quot;
she added , &quot; That was a long time ago , and he &apos;s been very kind . &quot;
in a statement Thursday , a representative for Jag@@ ger , 70 , says he &quot; categorically denies that he has ever made a pass at K@@ aty Perry . &quot;
the re@@ p adds : &quot; perhaps she is confusing him with someone else . &quot;

George Ker@@ evan : Europe break @-@ up gives Scots choice
another day , another independence scare story .
this time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe @-@ wide free @-@ travel zone as a condition of EU membership .
cue stories about passport controls at Ber@@ wick and a bar@@ bed wire border along Had@@ rian &apos;s Wall .
true , the Stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe , though - predict@@ ably - that did not figure in the headlines .
nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them .
since Scotland isn &apos;t in the Schengen area now , continued non @-@ compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots .
so , a non @-@ story , then .
and one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossi@@ l@@ ised : I first heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; can@@ ard at least 40 years ago .
yet there is an interesting point lost in this ret@@ elling of a whis@@ k@@ ery old tale .
why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe &apos;s bidding , anyway ?
why trade London &apos;s yoke for that of Brussels , especially now ?
here is the real European news : the great , post @-@ war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled .
with the euro crisis , Project Europe is officially dead .
across the EU , parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU , or to scrapping the euro as a common currency , are gaining ground .
even in Germany , the Euro@@ sceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September &apos;s federal elections , thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats ( equivalent to our own Lib D@@ ems ) out of the Bundestag .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .
however , the current economic crisis has proved a water@@ shed .
the austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , coupled with the stra@@ it@@ jacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency , has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far .
the crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece .
rather , the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep .
without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation , southern Europe finds itself with a built @-@ in productivity disadvantage vis @-@ à @-@ vis Germany .
the only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin .
beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise .
as a result of &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer &apos;s expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity , and four times as much for gas , as in the United States .
that is a crip@@ pling cost disadvantage , as we &apos;ve already seen at Gran@@ gem@@ outh .
all the wage free@@ zes in the world won &apos;t stop the European petro@@ chemicals industry being ham@@ mer@@ ed by cheap US shale gas .
as a result , revolt is brewing , especially in France , once the EU &apos;s main cheer@@ leader .
after the war , the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check , and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington .
but Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe , leaving the batter@@ ed French economy struggling .
result : marine Le Pen &apos;s right @-@ wing , anti @-@ EU National Front has just won a crucial by @-@ election , knocking the ruling Socialists into third place .
the Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can &apos;t assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left .
what is Le Pen doing with her new@@ found popularity among the French white , working class ?
she wants to use next year &apos;s EU elections to create an anti @-@ EU , anti @-@ common currency bloc across the European Parliament .
if , as is very possible , anti @-@ EU parties do well in these elections , such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time .
here &apos;s my point : sometime soon growing anti @-@ EU and anti @-@ common currency feeling in Europe will co@@ al@@ es@@ ce to kill the euro .
the EU won &apos;t disappear , but it will revert to something more like the loose &quot; Europe of the ( Sovereign ) Nations &quot; favoured by General de Gaulle .
Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies .
I expect the UK will distance itself from this project , hoping to cosy up to the US .
however , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold .
where does this leave Scotland ?
we can choose to be a region of ( essentially ) Little England .
or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off .
I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a loo@@ ser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency .
co @-@ operation with other like @-@ minded countries will be easier in a non @-@ federal Europe of the Nations .
otherwise we should consider em@@ ulating Norway and retaining our economic independence .
the SNP government in Scotland is - remark@@ abl@@ y@@ -- the most successful anti @-@ austerity political movement in Europe , having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by Labour &apos;s chancellor A@@ list@@ air Dar@@ ling and the subsequent T@@ ory @-@ Lib Dem coalition .
it would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
early pu@@ ber@@ ty : growing older sooner
African @-@ American and His@@ panic girls tend to reach pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier than their white counterparts , research shows .
physical changes don &apos;t mean pu@@ ber@@ ty is imminent
there &apos;s no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early pu@@ ber@@ ty
the trend toward early pu@@ ber@@ ty is not as pronounced with boys
former CNN correspondent Pat Eth@@ eri@@ dge is a journalist specializing in children &apos;s health and family issues .
should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to spro@@ ut breast buds and pub@@ ic hair at 7 or 8 ?
at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pedi@@ atri@@ cs this week in Orlando , Florida , pedi@@ atric en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Dr. Paul Kap@@ lo@@ witz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm .
&quot; I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually , this does not signal a rapid progression into full pu@@ ber@@ ty , &quot; said Kap@@ lo@@ witz .
obvious signs of development , such as bud@@ ding breasts , pub@@ ic and under@@ arm hair and body odor are appearing sooner in girls .
but there has been only a slight shift in the age of men@@ ar@@ che ( the first period ) over the past four decades .
in the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , down from 12.@@ 75 in 1970 .
&quot; once breasts begin to develop , it takes at least two to three years before men@@ ar@@ che , &quot; said Kap@@ lo@@ witz , also author of &quot; Early pu@@ ber@@ ty in Girls : the Essential Guide to Cop@@ ing with This Common Problem . &quot;
time is the most accurate test of how pu@@ ber@@ ty is going to progress .
there is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of pu@@ ber@@ ty , but it is considered &quot; pre@@ co@@ cious &quot; when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth sp@@ urt before age 8 .
in most cases , the process will slow down or stall -- something a pedi@@ atri@@ cian can monitor closely .
a more rapid progression may warrant tests by an en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist to rule out serious problems such as tum@@ ors or c@@ yst@@ s .
there are treatments to delay early men@@ ses and ward off another consequence : premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stun@@ ted growth and being short as an adult .
recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child &apos;s age , rate of development , growth rate and emotional maturity .
psycho@@ social aspects are important , too .
Kap@@ lo@@ witz is cautious with medication but acknowledges , &quot; suppressing pu@@ ber@@ ty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls &apos; feelings of being different from peers . &quot;
the other big issue is understandable : parents simply don &apos;t want their very young daughters having periods .
&quot; they worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene , &quot; said Kap@@ lo@@ witz .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10 .
even though there were signs and we had talked about menstru@@ ation , she was not emotionally prepared .
she came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends .
there are lots of well @-@ publici@@ zed theories about the causes of pre@@ co@@ cious pu@@ ber@@ ty .
yet , there &apos;s no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame .
boys - like girls - are hitting pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier .
Kap@@ lo@@ witz con@@ tends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity .
he helped conduct a 2001 study of 6@@ - to 9 @-@ year @-@ old girls that links body fat to the timing of pu@@ ber@@ ty .
other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
in this country , African @-@ American and His@@ panic girls tend to reach pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier than their white counterparts .
there are varying explanations .
globally , patterns of early pu@@ ber@@ ty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes .
another con@@ und@@ rum : although boys are getting facial and pub@@ ic hair at younger ages , the trend toward full @-@ blown early pu@@ ber@@ ty is not as pronounced as it is with girls .
other doctors attending the A@@ AP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic .
the appearance of acne and pub@@ ic hair is common even in infants and to@@ dd@@ lers .
&quot; we need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of pu@@ ber@@ ty , &quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silver@@ man , a pedi@@ atric en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist at Gor@@ y@@ eb Children &apos;s Hospital in Mor@@ rist@@ own , New Jersey .
parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pedi@@ atri@@ cian about how to talk with their child .
&quot; it may mean having a sooner @-@ than @-@ expected conversation , &quot; Kap@@ lo@@ witz advised .
if you remain calm , your child usually will respond well .
girls who blossom early need reassurance that , even when it happens ahead of schedule , the process is a normal part of life .
jet makers feu@@ d over seat width with big orders at stake
a row has flar@@ ed up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist @-@ class seats on long @-@ distance flights , setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month &apos;s Dubai Air@@ show .
the dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long @-@ haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most cour@@ ted by airlines , but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches ( 46 cm ) wide in economy cabins , but its U.S. arch @-@ rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide .
the dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever @-@ larger versions of their twin @-@ eng@@ ined long @-@ distance aircraft , with potentially record orders expected at the November 17 @-@ 21 event .
how the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot; mini @-@ j@@ umbo &quot; jet designs .
Boeing says its rev@@ amped &quot; 77@@ 7@@ X &quot; will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row .
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18 @-@ inch @-@ wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast .
plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press .
now , Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air@@ show , where the 77@@ 7@@ X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders .
it recently pre@@ viewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financi@@ ers a slide illustrating three people squ@@ ashed together at a restaurant , titled &quot; W@@ ould You Acc@@ ept This ? &quot;
&quot; Boeing is proposing long @-@ distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo @-@ pro@@ ps , &quot; said Airbus sales chief John Le@@ ahy .
as diets change , people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed .
between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 j@@ umbo defined modern long @-@ haul travel , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American 40@@ - to 49 @-@ year @-@ old male increased by 10 per cent , according to U.S. Health Department Data .
the waist of the average 21st @-@ century American male is 39.@@ 7 inches , according to U.S. health statistics .
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average gir@@ th of the newly chri@@ sten@@ ed &quot; jet set &quot; was narrower .
Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent .
Boeing disputes Airbus &apos;s figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities .
it also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat .
&quot; it really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful , &quot; said Boeing cabins expert Kent Cra@@ ver .
they don &apos;t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for flyers it is about more el@@ bow room , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings .
behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $ 700 @-@ billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades , enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports .
as Reuters first reported in July , seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets .
both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin @-@ eng@@ ined long @-@ haul designs than the market leader in that segment , the 365 @-@ seat Boeing 777 @-@ 300@@ ER .
Boeing &apos;s performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10 @-@ abreast 77@@ 7@@ X with an original 9 @-@ abreast 777 design .
the gain in unit costs is bl@@ unted compared with 10 @-@ abreast now in use .
&quot; the reason Boeing are doing this is to cra@@ m more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products , &quot; said Kevin Ken@@ ist@@ on , head of passenger comfort at Europe &apos;s Airbus .
on the other hand , analysts say full 10 @-@ seat @-@ per @-@ row cabins for existing 77@@ 7@@ s suggest many passengers are voting for the den@@ ser layout , which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares .
&quot; eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777 , &quot; said cabin interiors expert Mary Kir@@ by , founder and editor of the Run@@ way Girl Network .
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from .
globe @-@ tro@@ t@@ ting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts .
while boasting comfort , all builders also offer jets with high @-@ density layouts for low @-@ cost airlines and regional travel .
Airbus offers a 10 @-@ abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it .
until recently , Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets .
without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets , experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly , but could distract from a wave of 77@@ 7@@ X sales .
new anti @-@ nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking
scientists have developed an anti @-@ nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette .
a single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life .
further tests are needed before starting human trials , which would take several years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Wei@@ ll Corn@@ ell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good .
&quot; we are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop , exhausting all the methods on the market today , but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches , &quot; Pro@@ f Corn@@ ell said .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti @-@ nicotine anti@@ bodies .
the virus selectively inf@@ ects liver cells , which then start to make a steady stream of the anti@@ bodies .
the anti@@ bodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the blood@@ stream , neutr@@ alising them before they reached the brain , preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit .
in tests , vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity .
but mice who had not been given the vaccine &quot; chilled out , &quot; say the researchers , a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains .
the experiments are described in the journal Science Transl@@ ational Medicine .
previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained anti@@ bodies .
the j@@ abs had to be given so frequently to keep anti@@ body levels topped up that they proved expensive and im@@ practical .
but the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower , because it turns liver cells into anti@@ body factories .
pro@@ f Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , preventing nicotine addiction .
but more likely it would be used by smokers to quit .
&quot; they will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine , and that can help them kick the habit , &quot; he said .
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed .
Tri@@ po@@ di denies being influenced by O@@ bei@@ d
former N@@ SW Labor minister Joe Tri@@ po@@ di will be investigated by the state &apos;s corruption watch@@ dog .
former N@@ SW minister Joe Tri@@ po@@ di has denied changing maritime le@@ ases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie O@@ bei@@ d , who had hidden interests in three properties on government @-@ controlled land .
the Independent Commission Against Cor@@ ruption ( IC@@ AC ) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr O@@ bei@@ d lob@@ bi@@ ed several state ministers to have le@@ ases at Cir@@ cular Quay , where the O@@ bei@@ ds owned two restaurants and a cafe , renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005 .
it &apos;s now investigating allegations Mr Tri@@ po@@ di knew of Mr O@@ bei@@ d &apos;s secret interest in the properties , after evidence given by Mr Tri@@ po@@ di &apos;s former deputy chief of staff , Lynne Ash@@ pole , on Thursday .
during years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the le@@ ases to go to public tender .
the les@@ sees were against this and also wanted longer terms .
in 2009 le@@ ases for the Cir@@ cular Quay enterprises , which earned the O@@ bei@@ ds about $ 2.5 million annually , were renewed without going to public tender .
Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009 , was initially in favour of public tenders .
but he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr O@@ bei@@ d , who Mr Tri@@ po@@ di acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy .
a phone trans@@ cript tabled in IC@@ AC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr O@@ bei@@ d , Mr Tri@@ po@@ di and Steve Dunn , a senior bureau@@ cr@@ at who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr O@@ bei@@ d in the fisheries department .
&quot; was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy , &quot; Assistant Commissioner Anthony W@@ heal@@ y asked Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
&quot; no , &quot; Mr Tri@@ po@@ di replied .
I can &apos;t remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn &apos;t that .
definitely not between myself and Mr O@@ bei@@ d .
Israeli war@@ planes attack target inside Syria , official says
Israeli war@@ planes struck a target inside the Syrian port city of Lat@@ akia Thursday night , a senior administration official confirms to Fox News .
the official did not specify what the target was , but said there was at least one .
the Associ@@ ated Press reports the target was Russian @-@ made SA @-@ 125 missiles .
at least twice earlier this year Israel launched air@@ strikes on shipments of missiles inside Syria .
foreign workers on 4@@ 57 visas could undergo &quot; genu@@ in@@ eness &quot; test
a &quot; genu@@ in@@ eness &quot; test for foreign workers on 4@@ 57 visas is being considered by the government as it contem@@ plates expanding a crackdown .
the test , if adopted , would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 45@@ 7@@ s being used to fill unskilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia .
a government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Max@@ ine Mc@@ Ke@@ w sl@@ ammed the government &apos;s rhetoric about foreign workers , saying it could offend Australia &apos;s neighbours .
&quot; loud declarations about &apos; foreigners getting to the back of the queue &apos; and &apos; Aus@@ sie jobs first &apos; are a very unpleasant thro@@ w@@ back to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market , &quot; she told the Australia India Institute today .
historically , that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact , I wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
the discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bow@@ en .
immigration Minister Br@@ end@@ an O &apos;@@ Connor , who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling , has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration .
if the &quot; genu@@ in@@ eness &quot; criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrutin@@ ised about &quot; whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business . &quot;
businesses could also be required to account for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds .
meanwhile , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week .
the man &apos;s distr@@ au@@ ght nine @-@ year @-@ old son travelled to Australia with him and has been comfor@@ ted since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the vessel .
Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .
a study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the H@@ S2 rail project has been announced by the UK government .
the work by H@@ S2 Ltd suggests high @-@ speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 20@@ 26 .
transport minister Baroness Kr@@ amer said the project would &quot; bring the UK together . &quot;
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was &quot; excited &quot; to work with the UK government on the plan .
phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands .
when Phase Two is completed , lines will run to Manchester and Leeds .
in June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high @-@ speed link between London and the North of England from £ 32.@@ 7@@ bn to £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6@@ b@@ n.
the UK government , which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland , has instructed H@@ S2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland .
this is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less .
Baroness Kr@@ amer said : &quot; our goal for H@@ S2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together . &quot;
we are driving forward H@@ S2 because the benefits it will bring are huge .
without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network .
but it is also about connectivity , across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of H@@ S2 .
Scottish Secretary A@@ list@@ air Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael added : &quot; today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &quot;
for the Scottish government , Keith Brown called on Mr Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael to &quot; unequivocally &quot; back Scotland &apos;s inclusion in the H@@ S2 network .
Mr Brown said : &quot; high speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland , but also adds Scotland &apos;s economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain . &quot;
so we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland , creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow @-@ Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning .
I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps .
aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now
Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take @-@ off and landing despite moves in the US to loo@@ sen regulations covering the devices .
the US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e @-@ books , watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in &quot; airplane &quot; mode .
passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e @-@ books during take @-@ offs and landings .
Australian carriers are looking at the decision , which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements , but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures .
the Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia .
&quot; Casa currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft , &quot; it said .
the issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members .
Virgin , which has already been talking to CASA about extending the use its in @-@ flight wi @-@ fi entertainment system , was am@@ enable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator .
&quot; we would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have ( wireless in @-@ flight entertainment ) on our planes , &quot; a spokesman said .
Q@@ ant@@ as said it would stick with the current rules for now .
&quot; our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take @-@ off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that , &quot; it said .
the FAA ruling applies to American airlines .
however , we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA &apos;s decision and the reasons behind it .
for US carriers , the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet .
carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals , training materials , carry @-@ on baggage programs and passenger bri@@ e@@ fin@@ gs .
&quot; once an airline veri@@ fies the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use handheld , lightweight electronic devices such as tablets , e @-@ readers , and smart@@ phones @-@ at all altitudes , &quot; the FAA said .
in rare instances of low visibility , the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing .
the group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely st@@ owed under seats or in overhead bins during take @-@ off and landing .
travelling B@@ VB fans created terrible scenes with flar@@ es in the Velt@@ ins Arena before the district der@@ by against Schalke
Bor@@ ussia Dortmund announced that there would be serious consequences .
before Friday &apos;s Bundesliga match against VfB Stuttgart , the &apos; Ul@@ tras &apos; responded with silence - initially .
it was an unusual , almost gho@@ stly atmosphere that the fans created until shortly before the kick @-@ off of the Bundesliga match between the German runners @-@ up Bor@@ ussia Dort@@ mend and VfB Stuttgart , in the Signal Id@@ una Park .
it was mainly the ch@@ ants of away fans that could be heard .
the south stand , on the other hand , where the most loyal - and the lou@@ dest - of B@@ VB fans stand , was initially unusually quiet : no singing and no battle cries .
the &apos; Capo &apos;s &apos; podium , the individual who usually coordinates the un@@ ison ch@@ ants , remained empty .
and right at the front , on the stand , a single large flag with the text &quot; Stadium Ban Section &quot; ble@@ w in the wind .
only when goal@@ keeper , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller , was the first B@@ VB player to step onto the field , did che@@ ers briefly erup@@ t , as is usually the case .
when his team mates followed , there was loud singing and scar@@ ves were wav@@ ing - but by no means everywhere .
in the central blocks of the south stand , blocks 12 and 13 , nothing moved .
even stadium announ@@ cer , Norbert Dick@@ el , speaking once again of the successful results in recent days - the der@@ by victory , the win against Arsenal , the contract extension of coach Jör@@ gen Kl@@ opp - did not raise spirits .
just five minutes before kick @-@ off , the Capo climbed onto his podium - and the tension that had been almost tangible up until that point , lifted with a large shout , as Dick@@ el asked for a shout from each section of fans as usual .
as always , the south stand was left until the end , and finally the stand resumed its usual role as the lou@@ dest section of the stadium .
and as soon as the vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous request for &quot; der@@ by winners stand up &quot; came from the south stand upon kick @-@ off , everything was back to normal .
the previous silence was indeed a reaction to the events of previous days .
immediately before the local district der@@ by against FC Schalke 04 , some of the travelling B@@ VB fans fired flar@@ es into the crowds of spectators and onto the pitch - and in so doing almost hit goal@@ keeper Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller .
the kick @-@ off was delayed on account of the chaotic scenes ,
as a result , B@@ VB Chairman Hans Joachim W@@ atz@@ ke had invited the heads of the Dortmund Ul@@ tras fan group to his office - and if W@@ atz@@ ke &apos;s words are to be believed , this was a rather uncomfortable meeting for the fan representatives .
&quot; there will be massive impact for the entire Ultra movement , &quot; announced the B@@ VB Chairman on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .
as an immediate measure , W@@ atz@@ ke prohibited the Ul@@ tras from organising chore@@ ography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart .
&quot; I have banned it , &quot; he explained .
we cannot ignore the zero tolerance policy regarding pyro@@ technics in Saxony .
in addition , the Ul@@ tras were given the option of several different punishments - they now have until Tuesday to decide which one to accept .
otherwise B@@ VB will impose a sanction by the end of next week , said W@@ atz@@ ke .
&quot; it will be severe , &quot; assured W@@ atz@@ ke .
it will be interesting to see the reactions in the south stand then .
pa@@ wn@@ brokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the p@@ inch
at a pa@@ wn@@ shop in Ben@@ de@@ meer shopping centre in Singapore , Jan@@ ani Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ inga is sw@@ apping a gold b@@ angle , ring and pair of ear@@ rings to pay her daughters &quot; school fees .
&quot; my husband and I have just bought a house so all my money &apos;s stuck there , &quot; Mrs Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ inga says .
even though she earns S $ 3,000 ( $ 2,@@ 400 ) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well , the monthly family income is insufficient , she says .
indeed , such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that Val@@ ue@@ Max , where she is carrying out her transaction , this week became the third pa@@ wn@@ shop to list on the Singapore stock exchange .
pa@@ w@@ ning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S $ 1,@@ 300 in Ms Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ inga &apos;s case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .
typically pa@@ wn@@ brokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent , just above the 15.@@ 4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .
however , pa@@ wn@@ brokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary , and can arrange loans faster than banks .
hence millions of people across the region are turning to pa@@ wn@@ shops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballo@@ oning household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies , lower@@ - and middle @-@ income families are turning to pa@@ wn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow .
this week Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s , the rating agency , cited increasing household leverage , mainly from rising mortgages , as a risk factor for Asian banks &quot; credit@@ worthiness .
it said that Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia .
Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP , up from 60 per cent in 2008 .
economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession .
on Thursday , data showed continued export weakness , and a sof@@ tening in consumer demand .
&quot; bottom line is that with costs rising , people in the middle to lower end &#91; of the income scale &#93; will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can , &quot; says Song Sen@@ g W@@ un , economist at C@@ IM@@ B , a Malaysian bank .
historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pa@@ wn personal belongings , as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery .
in Singapore , about 70 per cent of items pa@@ w@@ ned at the city @-@ state &apos;s 200 pa@@ wn outlets are gold .
people are saying &quot; the gold price looks good , let &apos;s pa@@ wn grand@@ ma &apos;s gold chain and get it back next month .
in Thailand the largest pa@@ wn@@ shop operator , Easy@@ Money , has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months .
such is the growth in the pa@@ wn business that Val@@ ue@@ Max , operator of the outlet at Ben@@ de@@ meer and of 15 others like it in Singapore , plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too , says Ye@@ ah Lee Ch@@ ing , Val@@ ue@@ Max &apos;s executive director .
the company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S $ 66@@ m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange .
while some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates , Ms Ye@@ ah says that not only does pa@@ w@@ ning offer cheaper rates than other lenders , it also does not add directly to debt .
&quot; customers are mortg@@ aging items that they already own , and mon@@ eti@@ sing personal assets does not increase household debt , &quot; she says .
there &apos;s an increased social acceptance of pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ king as a means to secure short term , secured financing .
nor are the types of people who use pa@@ wn@@ brokers only the financially stretched .
wealthy people in Singapore also use Val@@ ue@@ Max outlets , pa@@ w@@ ning gold bars or Rolex watches , which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash .
we see customers from all walks of life .
&quot; they include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments , or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs , &quot; says Ms Ye@@ ah .
sometimes they just need the money very quickly .

$ 3@@ 25@@ m rescue package for Tas@@ sie health
the Federal Government insists a $ 325 million rescue package for Tas@@ mania &apos;s ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can &apos;t waste the funds .
Federal Health Minister T@@ anya P@@ liber@@ sek has announced the Commonwealth is taking &quot; urgent action &quot; to head off a crisis caused by the island state &apos;s aging population , higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints .
the funding , over four years , was decided after government consultations with Tas@@ man@@ ian independent MP Andrew Wil@@ kie .
&quot; the Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state , &quot; Ms P@@ liber@@ sek said today .
the $ 325 million package includes a $ 31 million el@@ ective surgery bl@@ itz .
an additional 2600 operations including orthop@@ edic and cat@@ ar@@ act surgery will help clear a backlog .
there &apos;s also money for walk @-@ in clinics in Hob@@ art and Laun@@ c@@ eston , better after @-@ hospital care , medical specialist training , mental health services and the roll@@ out of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals .
&quot; these investments respond to the ideas that front @-@ line clin@@ icians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tas@@ mania &apos;s health system , &quot; Ms P@@ liber@@ sek said .
the minister insisted the Tas@@ man@@ ian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime .
the state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds .
a three @-@ person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
Mr Wil@@ kie today said the $ 325 million would count for little &quot; unless it &apos;s followed by genuine reform to put Tas@@ mania &apos;s public health system on a more sustainable footing . &quot;
he nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .
&quot; I &apos;m hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state &apos;s public health system off the critical list , &quot; Mr Wil@@ kie said .
according to the State Government these additional el@@ ective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
but federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dut@@ ton believes today &apos;s announcement is a &quot; band @-@ aid solution . &quot;
&quot; the reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ri@@ pped $ 430 million out of its health system , &quot; he told ABC TV .
you can &apos;t have a state government ri@@ pping out almost half @-@ a @-@ billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $ 300 million and pretend it &apos;s a good news day .
Mr Dut@@ ton called on Ms P@@ liber@@ sek to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .

Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability , watch@@ dog group says
Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions , the global chemical weapons watch@@ dog said Thursday as fierce clashes ra@@ ged in the country &apos;s north , close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored .
also Thursday , a Syrian activist group said more than 120@@ ,000 people have been killed since the start of the country &apos;s civil war nearly three years ago .
the announcement by the Organization for the Prohi@@ bition of Chemical Weapons came one day ahead of the Nov@@ .
1 deadline set by The Hague @-@ based organization for Damascus to destroy or &quot; render in@@ oper@@ able &quot; all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions .
the completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus &apos; chemical weapons by mid @-@ 2014 .
destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
however , Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stock@@ piles .
the country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including must@@ ard gas and the nerve agent s@@ arin .
the announcement came as fighting ra@@ ged Thursday in the town of Saf@@ ira , which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites , reported the Britain @-@ based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights .
the activist group , which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria , said Thursday that 120@@ ,@@ 296 people have died .
of those , it said 6@@ 1,0@@ 67 are civilians , including 6,@@ 365 children .
on the government side , it said 29,@@ 9@@ 54 are members of President Bashar Assad &apos;s armed forces , 18,@@ 6@@ 78 are pro @-@ government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants .
also among the dead it said were 2,@@ 202 army def@@ ectors and some 5,@@ 375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .
on July 25 , the U.@@ N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011 .
it has not updated that figure since .
the conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country .
Assad &apos;s troops have been batt@@ ling rebels , many of them linked to al @-@ Qaida groups , in Saf@@ ira for weeks .
the Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics .
the fighting under@@ scored the dangers the chemical weapons &apos; inspectors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war .
a statement from the O@@ PC@@ W , which works closely with the United Nations , said its team was &quot; now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria &apos;s declared critical production and mixing / filling equipment . &quot;
it added that , &quot; no further inspection activities are currently planned . &quot;
earlier this week , the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work , visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus .
they were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns , the inspectors said .
on Thursday , O@@ PC@@ W said the two locations were , according to Syria , &quot; abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites , which were inspected . &quot;
it was not immediately clear if the facility in Saf@@ ira was one of the two sites that O@@ PC@@ W inspectors were not able to visit .
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the O@@ PC@@ W &apos;s executive committee .
&quot; I salute the for@@ titude and courage you &apos;ve all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization , &quot; the watch@@ dog &apos;s director @-@ general , Ah@@ met U@@ zum@@ cu , said in comments released by the O@@ PC@@ W .
now in its third year , the civil war pits the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad &apos;s government and its security forces , which are stacked with members of his Ala@@ wi@@ te sect , an off@@ shoot of Shi@@ ite Islam .
in other developments , the Observatory &apos;s chief Ram@@ i Ab@@ dur@@ rah@@ man said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria &apos;s coastal province of Lat@@ akia .
the cause of the blast was not known , he said .
anger over Bali bomb plotter &apos;s sentence
survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plot@@ ters to face justice , saying Um@@ ar Pat@@ ek should face a firing squad .
Pat@@ ek , who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South @-@ East Asia &apos;s most wanted , was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing .
he could be released within 15 years if granted par@@ ole .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of K@@ uta which left 202 people dead , including 88 Austr@@ ali@@ ans , and injured scores more .
he was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism @-@ related charges , including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .
prosecutors had demanded a life sentence , although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the &quot; Demo@@ lition Man &quot; for his reputation as a master bomb @-@ maker be sentenced to death .
the decision has reign@@ ited painful memories for Perth mother June Cor@@ teen , who lost her 39 @-@ year @-@ old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Pat@@ ek and his co @-@ con@@ spir@@ ators almost a decade ago .
fighting back tears , she said Pat@@ ek should have been sentenced to death .
I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .
&quot; he should be put in front of the firing squad , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen told A@@ AP .
I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren , and my daughters .
the S@@ ari Club was levelled when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside was det@@ on@@ ated just after 11@@ pm on October 12 , 2002 .
Peter Hughes was in Pad@@ dy &apos;s Bar where a suicide bom@@ ber det@@ on@@ ated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier .
he lap@@ sed into a month @-@ long com@@ a in the wake of the bombing , and &quot; died &quot; three times while on life support .
Mr Hughes said Pat@@ ek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the J@@ em@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ iah terror cell responsible for the car@@ nage - Am@@ ro@@ zi , Mu@@ k@@ h@@ las and Imam Samu@@ dra - who were executed four years ago .
really , this guy should get the death penalty before anybody .
to keep him alive , well , there &apos;s no reason to keep him alive .
to get 20 years , after killing 202 people and inj@@ uring many hundreds , it &apos;s not much .
Pat@@ ek is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice .
he had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually appre@@ h@@ ended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where US forces killed former al @-@ Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later .
during the trial , an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Pat@@ ek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re @-@ establish links between South @-@ East Asian terrorist groups and al @-@ Qaeda .
&quot; he didn &apos;t give himself up , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen said .
until just recently , he really didn &apos;t feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people .
the verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year , which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia .
&quot; there will be a lot of tears this year , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen said .
Pat@@ ek may yet appeal his sentence .
FAA : air passengers can now use gadgets on planes ( but not make cell phone calls )
airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate @-@ to @-@ gate to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cell@@ phones - under much @-@ anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration .
but passengers shouldn &apos;t expect changes to happen immediately .
how fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline , FAA Administrator Michael Hu@@ erta said at a news conference .
airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they &apos;ve updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for st@@ owing devices to reflect the new guidelines .
the FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes .
Delta and Jet@@ Blue were among the air@@ liners who have already submitted plans .
&quot; depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the FAA said in a statement .
currently , passengers are required to turn off their smart@@ phones , tablets and other devices once a plane &apos;s door closes .
they &apos;re not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go @-@ ahead .
passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane desc@@ ends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground .
under the new guidelines , airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during take@@ offs , landings and tax@@ i@@ ing , the FAA said .
most new air@@ liners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria .
Laura Gl@@ ading , president of the Association of Professional Flight At@@ ten@@ dants , welcomed the changes .
&quot; once the new policy is safely implemented - and we &apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win @-@ win , &quot; Gl@@ ading said in a statement .
we &apos;re frankly tired of feeling like &apos; hall monitors &apos; when it comes to this issue .
but connecting to the Internet to surf , exchange emails , text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet , the agency said .
passengers will be told to switch their smart@@ phones , tablets and other devices to airplane mode .
so , still no Words With Friends , the online Scr@@ ab@@ ble @-@ type game that actor Al@@ ec Bald@@ win was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate .
and heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be st@@ owed because of concern they might inj@@ ure someone if they go flying around the cabin .
in @-@ flight cell@@ phone calls also will continue to be prohibited .
regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission , not the FAA .
FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during take@@ off and landing
last month , National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosen@@ ker , a CBS News national transportation safety expert , said that cell phones are still considered a risk .
&quot; cell phones , that really is an issue , not just because potentially it could create interference with navig@@ ational devices , but we do know , according to the F@@ CC , that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they &apos;re in the air , &quot; Rosen@@ ker said .
an industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices .
pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use .
critics such as Sen@@ . Claire Mc@@ Cas@@ kill , D @-@ Mo . , contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions .
the restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous .
some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices .
the FAA began restricting passengers &apos; use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios , the high @-@ tech gadgets of their day .
new air@@ liners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference .
airlines have been offering Wi @-@ Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years .
planes modified for Wi @-@ Fi systems are also more resistant to interference .
the vast majority of air@@ liners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines , Hu@@ erta said .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices .
e @-@ readers , for example , emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page .
but transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data .
among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers &apos; use of the devices has been Amazon@@ .com.
in 2011 , company officials loaded an air@@ liner full of their Kin@@ dle e @-@ readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none .
FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk .
Douglas Kid@@ d of the National Association of Airline Pass@@ engers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal .
other committee members said there are only anec@@ dot@@ al reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems , and most of those reports are very old .
however , the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility .
a travel industry group welcomed the changes , calling them common @-@ sense accommodations for a traveling public now bri@@ st@@ ling with technology .
&quot; we &apos;re pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security , &quot; said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .
bird air@@ lifted to safety from North Sea rig released back into wild
a bird air@@ lifted ashore after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild .
the water rail was put on a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before being nur@@ sed back to health by the Scottish SP@@ CA at its rescue centre in Al@@ lo@@ a .
centre manager Colin Sed@@ don said : &quot; this water rail was likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who got caught up in strong winds over the North Sea . &quot;
it seems the bird became exhausted and managed to find refuge on the oil rig .
he added : &quot; it was unable to fly off again so we were contacted for help . &quot;
the water rail was fit and well by the time it was released .
is Europe &apos;s elite ready to do business with Britain ?
business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK &apos;s wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU .
to that end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain , business and the EU .
You@@ G@@ ov poll@@ ed over 1,000 business leaders , broadly representative of Britain &apos;s business sizes , sectors and regions .
the conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many .
we found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe , focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagn@@ ate .
they want to see the Government prioritise new trading links with the likes of China , India and Brazil , rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU &apos;s ar@@ cane institutions .
when asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster .
there was general discontent with the Single Market , with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now out@@ weighed the benefits of being part of Europe &apos;s trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses , traditionally the most pro @-@ European of companies , agreed .
finally , and most tell@@ ingly of all , our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade , not politics .
this finding , which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups , shows that business is pushing for a &quot; meaningful change &quot; that brings powers back to the UK .
the stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum .
the Prime Minister should be in no doubt : this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegoti@@ ating the terms of Britain &apos;s membership of the EU .
it also shows that business expects that renegoti@@ ation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK .
a better deal for British business is possible , and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embark@@ s on the road to closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and , as the findings of our poll show , for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels &quot; regulatory approach .
Gazprom &apos;s Alex@@ ei Miller says pipeline in Bulgaria starts new gas era
the start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s largest energy projects , Gazprom &apos;s chief said .
&quot; a landmark event has taken place today : construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the most large @-@ scale and important project in Europe , &quot; Gazprom Chairman Alex@@ ei Miller said in a statement Thursday .
this project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent .
South Stream is meant to add diversity to Russia &apos;s export routes through Europe .
a contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , which hosts most of Russia &apos;s gas for Europe , adds a layer of risk to conventional routes , officials say .
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &quot; forever . &quot;
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015 .
Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by year &apos;s end .
the pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
nothing beats Germany as a property location for national and international investors .
the economic situation is right , and the financing options are fantastic .
this was the message of the 9th &apos; Immobili@@ entag &apos; ( Property Day ) organised by the Börsen Zeitung ( stock exchange newspaper ) .
the German property markets are benefiting from the country &apos;s economic strength and general conditions which , compared with the rest of Europe , are very competitive .
this was pointed out by Christian Ul@@ br@@ ich , Jones Lang La@@ S@@ alle CEO for Europe , the Near East and Africa , at the 9th &apos; Immobili@@ entag &apos; ( Property Day ) organised by the Börsen Zeitung ( stock exchange newspaper ) .
the extent to which German commercial properties are sought after is evident in the transaction volumes , said Ul@@ br@@ ich .
in the first three quarters of this year , there was an increase of 31 % compared to the same period the year before .
in Great Britain , growth stands at just 6 % , and in France at 19 % .
&quot; property investments offer an attractive rate of return , &quot; said Ul@@ br@@ ich .
the yield gap between properties and federal government bonds is at a historically high level .

two Y@@ M@@ CA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord , Royal Commission h@@ ears
two Y@@ M@@ CA N@@ SW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Car@@ ing@@ bah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011 , the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard .
but in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had &quot; never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation , &quot; the Commission was told .
chief executive officer Phillip H@@ are was asked about one case where a Y@@ M@@ CA employee was charged child pornography offences , and another when a gym instructor at the Y@@ M@@ CA Car@@ ing@@ bah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991 .
Mr H@@ are told G@@ ail Fur@@ ness , counsel assisting the Commission , he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one .
he conc@@ eded the Y@@ M@@ CA &apos;s opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming &quot; there have been external audits of the Y@@ M@@ CA that have recognised the Y@@ M@@ CA as being at the forefront of child safety . &quot;
evidence before the commission is that Y@@ M@@ CA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year .
Mr H@@ are , who started with the Y@@ M@@ CA when he was 21 , conc@@ eded management &quot; from myself down &quot; failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches .
earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the Y@@ M@@ CA .
he was j@@ ailed for a minimum of six years .
but Mr H@@ are rejected the suggestion the Y@@ M@@ CA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord &apos;s breaches of child safety .
staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children , baby@@ sitting them privately , having them sit on his lap , saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone .
Daniel@@ le O@@ ck@@ well , who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour , testified she found the Y@@ M@@ CA Car@@ ing@@ bah children &apos;s services manager Jacqu@@ i Bar@@ nat who supervised Lord &quot; very intimid@@ ating and hard to approach a lot of the time . &quot;
the CEO said he did not accept staff &apos;s evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers .
rather , he said , their friendships with Lord clou@@ ded their judgements about reporting him .
Mr H@@ are said he had provided his view to the Y@@ M@@ CA N@@ SW board that the lesson for the organisation from the &quot; Jonathan Lord incident &quot; was &quot; not about reporting &quot; by staff , and the board agreed with him .
Mr H@@ are said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by Y@@ M@@ CA general manager of children &apos;s services Li@@ am Whit@@ ley .
he said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was &quot; over@@ ze@@ alous &quot; and poorly executed .
Y@@ M@@ CA N@@ SW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 , child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Small@@ bone of Griff@@ ith University told the commission .
he said there were &quot; serious problems &quot; in recruitment , screening , induction , training and supervision of staff .
the hearing adjourned until December 20 .
Tony Blair said he &apos;d seize the chance to return as Britain &apos;s prime minister - but acknowledges a comeback is unlikely .
in an interview overnight to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 59 @-@ year @-@ old aired his views on various domestic policies .
since he stood down in June 2007 after a decade as leader , Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics , confin@@ ing most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy to the Quartet of Middle East peac@@ emakers .
asked if he would return to the post of prime minister , Mr Blair was quoted by London &apos;s Even@@ ing Standard as saying : &quot; yes , sure , but it &apos;s not likely to happen is it , so ... &quot;
as crowds of horse @-@ showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Horse of the Year , they knew the competition would be tough .
but nobody was quite ready for three @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ent@@ on Kir@@ kland .
not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps , the tod@@ dler and his pet Shet@@ land p@@ ony T@@ off@@ ee tro@@ t@@ ted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents trailing behind .
the inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance , behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sunn@@ y@@ bank Equ@@ estrian Centre , in Ru@@ dry near Cardiff .
taking to the stage against men and women in smart bow@@ ler hats , he ti@@ pped his flat cap at a ja@@ un@@ ty angle and par@@ aded two @-@ year @-@ old T@@ off@@ ee around the ring .
F@@ ent@@ on was lau@@ ded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years .
and T@@ off@@ ee received top marks for his appearance and personality .
F@@ ent@@ on was given T@@ off@@ ee as a third birthday present last March and has practised with the Shet@@ land p@@ ony every day since .
his mother Donna , 30 , said : &quot; F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee are a great double act . &quot;
they were up against all com@@ ers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and ros@@ ette .
it was only the second time he had competed with T@@ off@@ ee and we were all ec@@ static when he won .
complete strangers in the arena all thought he was so phenomenal they wanted photos taken with him .
the young@@ ster , from the village of N@@ ant@@ y@@ gl@@ o , near Eb@@ b@@ w Vale , South Wales , is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon How@@ ells , who has been showing horses for more than 10 years .
Mrs How@@ ells said : &quot; the whole place was electric and everybody was che@@ ering and cl@@ apping . &quot;
he was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a marvellous job .
F@@ ent@@ on is animal mad - he loves horses , tractors and farms and has got two chickens which he looks after .
the way he has started he &apos;ll be at the Horse of the Year show before long - and I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll do well .
a spokesman for the annual horse show said : &quot; F@@ ent@@ on is only three but he knows how to handle his p@@ ony . &quot;
they are a great team together .
the judges marked F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring .
they look for good teamwork between the p@@ ony and the handler - F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee were the best in the ring .
I &apos;m sure F@@ ent@@ on was helped by his cute clothes , he really looked the part .
China plea paper &apos; to be overhau@@ led@@ &apos;
a Chinese newspaper that made a front @-@ page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defam@@ ation is to be overhau@@ led , a press regulator says .
the Guangzhou @-@ based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Y@@ ong@@ zhou .
but Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bri@@ bes to fabric@@ ate stories about a part state @-@ owned company .
now the New Express is to undergo &quot; full rectification , &quot; the regulator said .
the &quot; rectification &quot; order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Public@@ ation , Radio , Film and Television .
a preliminary investigation showed that Yang@@ chen@@ g Even@@ ing News Group &apos;s New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoom@@ lion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013 .
&quot; new Express &apos;s editorial management was dis@@ ordered , &quot; the regulator said in a statement .
it said it had decided to &quot; impose an administrative penalty on Chen Y@@ ong@@ zhou by revo@@ king his reporter &apos;s license . &quot;
it had also &quot; instructed Yang@@ chen@@ g Even@@ ing News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express , and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express &apos;s leadership team . &quot;
Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleg@@ ing financial irregularities at a construction @-@ equipment company called Zoom@@ lion .
after he was detained , his newspaper published two front @-@ page appeals for his release , saying it backed his journalism .
but Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money .
&quot; in this case I &apos;ve caused damages to Zoom@@ lion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public &apos;s trust , &quot; he told state broad@@ caster CCTV .
I did this mainly because I han@@ k@@ ered after money and fame .
I &apos;ve realised my wrong@@ doing .
following Mr Chen &apos;s apology , New Express issued a front @-@ page apology , saying it had failed to properly check his reports .
several high @-@ profile suspects have made telev@@ ised con@@ fes@@ sions recently .
experts say con@@ fes@@ sions are still routinely coer@@ ced , despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to inc@@ rimin@@ ate themselves .
us @-@ Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway found
one of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found , complete with its own lighting , ventilation and electric rail systems .
us authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered .
the tunnel , which zig@@ z@@ ags the length of nearly six football pitches , links warehouses near Ti@@ juana , Mexico and San Diego , USA .
the area is filled with non@@ descri@@ pt warehouses , making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs .
the tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through und@@ et@@ ected , authorities said .
authorities seized eight @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half tons of mari@@ juana and 3@@ 27 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel &apos;s discovery , according to court records .
three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of mari@@ juana and cocaine with intent to distribute .
they face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convicted .
in N@@ og@@ ales , Arizona , smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals .
the tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .
some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico &apos;s mari@@ juana harvest in October , which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers .
in 2010 , authorities found a roughly 700 @-@ yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Ti@@ juana home to two San Diego warehouses .
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways .
however , in an interview , Bloom has said that he and Kerr still love each other .
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents to two @-@ year @-@ old Flynn .
actor Orlando Bloom announced his separation from his wife , super@@ model Miranda Kerr .
in an interview with US journalist K@@ atie Cour@@ ic , which is to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , &quot; sometimes life doesn &apos;t go exactly as we plan or hope for . &quot;
he and Kerr still love each other , emphasised the 36 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; we &apos;re going to support one another and love each other as parents to Flynn . &quot;
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 . their son Flynn was born in 2011 .
according to dictionaries , veg@@ anism is a sub @-@ category of veget@@ arianism , yet the two do differ considerably .
for while veget@@ arians allow themselves to consume cream tar@@ ts , ice cream or a strong E@@ dam , these indul@@ gences are off the menu for veg@@ ans .
milk , cheese , egg - alongside avoiding meat and fish , veg@@ ans refrain from eating all products of animal origin - even honey is not permitted .
you might ask what is left , however , upon closer inspection the world of vegan nutrition is characterised by great resour@@ c@@ efulness .
&quot; spreads are very popular , &quot; explained U@@ te H@@ enk@@ el@@ mann the owner of the local health food store , which provides a host of special products for veg@@ ans .
Reu@@ ben Proc@@ tor also likes to visit the store on &quot; Dom@@ gasse . &quot;
the New Ze@@ al@@ ander has been vegan for 13 years , and in Lam@@ per@@ theim he can find ( almost ) everything that he needs to get by . &quot; in 1997 I adjusted my diet and became a vegetarian . &quot;
at the turn of the millennium I took the next step and became vegan .
&quot; however , it wasn &apos;t just the diet that convinced me , but also my choice of shoes , &quot; said Proc@@ tor , who prefers artificial leather over normal leather .
he realised that you can also overcome all other daily concerns without animal products .
first and foremost , being vegan is a matter of ethics .
&quot; I don &apos;t want animals to have to die for me , &quot; said Proc@@ tor , expressing the maxim of veg@@ ans , which applies to all their consumer behaviour .
rather than missing bur@@ gers , scram@@ bled eggs or gum@@ mi bears , the vegan has quickly discovered entirely new products that really inspire him .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; says Proc@@ tor now , &quot; in actual fact being vegan is not about doing without , it &apos;s not about as@@ ce@@ ticism , but rather it is an enhancement . &quot; regarding the assumption that when you convert your diet you are reducing your choice of meal options , Proc@@ tor puts this down to force of habit .
and it is precisely this conditioning that results in many a well @-@ intentioned attempt failing .
&quot; the temptation factor is a decisive factor in causing many to quickly give up , similar to with smoking , &quot; says Proc@@ tor , providing a comparison .
and he argues : &quot; certain flavours are not linked to animal produce . &quot;
often it is the herbs or the type of preparation that provide the flavour .
&quot; you can , however , create the same effect in other ways , &quot; explains the vegan .
for example , when attending a barbecue party , Proc@@ tor brings auber@@ g@@ ines , mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages .
he ensures a balanced , varied diet , whereby everything should also have a good hearty flavour .
of course you want to have something with a bit of bite , that is fair enough .
&quot; it should be tasty , but this doesn &apos;t necessarily mean animal @-@ based food , &quot; said Proc@@ tor .
he has not suffered any damage to his health or eating disorders - another wide @-@ spread assumption .
converting has had a positive effect for me .
I do not consume any foreign cholesterol and have increased my vitamin intake .
there are top athletes who also have an exclusively vegan diet .
&quot; my blood values are excellent - I have myself checked on a regular basis , &quot; revealed Proc@@ tor .
many critics of veg@@ anism warn in particular of the lack of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; because animals are fed on fodder instead of grazing , it is dubious whether the vitamin B@@ 12 content in meat sold in free@@ zers is actually high , &quot; commented Proc@@ tor .
for veg@@ ans there is also the option of taking the co @-@ enzyme in the form of tablets .
&quot; my B@@ 12 values are fine , &quot; he explained .
Proc@@ tor does not have to travel far to buy food .
there are basic foodstuffs available everywhere , and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .
I can find everything I need locally .
I only purchase special items now and again .
&quot; many people overlook the fact that even though ready @-@ made vegan products are expensive , it is well @-@ known that this is also the case for &quot; normal &quot; ready @-@ made products .
in any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than commonly assumed .
&quot; in home cooking , there is much to be discovered - with a few minor tweak@@ s you can achieve good , if not sometimes better results , &quot; said Proc@@ tor .
mar@@ gar@@ ine in place of butter , a little more baking powder and bic@@ arbon@@ ate of so@@ da in place of egg - Proc@@ tor has even managed to aston@@ ish his in @-@ laws with his vegan cheese cakes .
the vegan adds new spice to family parties .
when you cook together there is a certain dynamic - cooking takes on new value .
&quot; the situations that may arise are as varied as the people themselves , &quot; said Proc@@ tor .
of course he has already met with scepticism .
do you not like my food any more ?
&quot; should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? &quot; - as a vegan you have to be tac@@ tful in such matters .
&quot; I do not dis@@ approve of people , I am part of this society , &quot; said Proc@@ tor , explaining that he was not choosing a life of isolation .
and on closer observation , the everyday world does not appear quite so &apos; un @-@ vegan &apos; - and veg@@ ans are not quite as limited in their everyday lives as is commonly assumed .
fast food is also permitted .
chips are available everywhere !
&quot; many don@@ er keb@@ ab houses offer fal@@ afel , or even vegetarian y@@ uf@@ ka , &quot; says Proc@@ tor .
in a pizzeria he avoids pasta dishes or just orders a pizza without cheese , all just a question of habit .
restaurants are slowly adapting to things .
&quot; when I began eating a vegan diet 13 years ago , things were even more difficult , &quot; says the New Ze@@ al@@ ander , and he points out : &quot; you have to talk with people , make them aware . &quot;
&quot; if enough requests are made , they will perhaps be inclined to expand their menus , &quot; he hopes .
there are vegan restaurants opening up , such as the Kom@@ bü@@ se in Mannheim or Café Vogel@@ frei .
Proc@@ tor hopes that other restaurants will also have at least one vegan dish on the menu .
essentially , vegan dishes are for everyone .
anyone can eat them , they are the exact opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes , on the other hand , are exclusive , in the tru@@ est sense of the word , as they rule others out , &quot; assessed Proc@@ tor .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scandals , veg@@ anism is a safe way to rule out the majority of scandals from the outset , &quot; says Proc@@ tor .
however , purchasing vegan products can be difficult to start with .
O@@ In@@ ce you come to understand that pe@@ an@@ uts , in particular , may also contain animal additives as a colour@@ ant , people seem to quickly lose courage when following a code of ethics with so many hurdles and pitfalls .
therefore , for this reason and others , Reu@@ ben Proc@@ tor and Lars Thomsen have written a book . &quot; Veg@@ an@@ issimo - Tier@@ ische Inhaltsstoffe und ihre Alternativen &quot; ( Veg@@ an@@ issimo - Animal In@@ gre@@ di@@ ents and their Altern@@ atives ) explains the many ingredients hidden in both foodstuffs and cleaning agents .
&quot; you gradually develop an internal scanner and you know which symbols and logos you have to look out for . &quot; Proc@@ tor has learned that &quot; it is sometimes better too take small steps rather than to stand still or stum@@ ble . &quot;
veg@@ anism is an important moral compass , which has an effect on your consciousness .
perhaps he won &apos;t manage to help you break old habits altogether , but at least he manages to teach consumers to critically question their habits .
stock exchange operator Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X keeps its customers on t@@ enter@@ hooks .
trading at the Nas@@ da@@ q Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon , German time .
in an announcement , the operator cited technical problems as the reason .
on the other eleven options markets , including two also operated by Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X , business continued as normal .
the most recent incident is the latest in a series of both small and large break@@ downs suffered by the stock exchange operator .
as recently as last Tuesday , the Nas@@ da@@ q indices were not calculated for one hour due to data transfer errors .
in August of this year there were two break@@ downs in a single week .
first of all , US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent large quantities of incorrect purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems .
as a result , the stock exchange operators required almost an entire day to look through and delete the orders .
two days later , half of all stock dealing in the USA came to a standstill for several hours , due to a computer failure in the Nas@@ da@@ q exchange .
furthermore , last year the listing of Facebook on the stock exchange caused quite a fur@@ ore .
the Nas@@ da@@ q systems could not cope with the flood of purchase and sales orders , the Exchange Supervisory Authority established at a later date , imposing a record penalty of 10 million dollars on the company .
Konstanz : cycl@@ ist kno@@ cks over 63 @-@ year @-@ old man
according to the police , the accident occurred on Thursday evening at around 10 : 00 p.m. , when a 26 @-@ year @-@ old man was cycling illegally , on the left foot@@ path of the Bahnhof@@ platz in the direction of Markt@@ stätte , on a ladies bicycle .
according to police , when a 63 @-@ year @-@ old man suddenly stepped out of a pub onto the foot@@ path , the cycl@@ ist was unable to brake in time .
during the subsequent collision , the pedestrian was thrown against the wall of the building , and then fell onto the ground , suffering a lac@@ eration to the head that measured around 15 cen@@ timet@@ res in length .
an ambul@@ ance team brought the injured man to the clinic for medical treatment .
British police serve Ass@@ ange with extradition notice
B@@ ti@@ tish police served an extradition notice today on WikiLeaks founder Julian Ass@@ ange , who has taken refuge in Ecuador &apos;s embassy in London and requested asylum .
Scotland Yard said they had served a &quot; surrender notice &quot; on the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station , adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest .
Ass@@ ange faces extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations , having exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition earlier this month .
fearing Stockholm would pass him on to the US , he sought refuge at Ecuador &apos;s embassy in London on June 19 , asking the South American country for political asylum .
Scotland Yard has &quot; served a surrender notice upon a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing , &quot; a spokesman said .
he remains in breach of his bail conditions .
the embassy declined to comment on the serving of the police notice .
Ass@@ ange fears he will be extradi@@ ted from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges , after releasing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks anti @-@ secrecy website .
driver speeding at 130@@ mph with hot drink between legs fined £ 1,000
a motor@@ ist has been fined £ 1,000 for driving at up to 130@@ mph ( 2@@ 10km / h ) with a hot drink balanced between his legs .
Andrew Ho@@ wie , 35 , of Ti@@ p@@ tree , Essex , was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A@@ 120 at Brain@@ tree on 27 May .
when police stopped him they discovered the take@@ away drink between his legs .
at Col@@ chester Magist@@ rates &apos; Court Ho@@ wie admitted a charge of driving without due care and attention .
seven points added to his licence resulted in him receiving a six @-@ month driving ban .
Ho@@ wie was also ordered to pay costs of £ 90 and a victim surcharge of £ 100 .
tax on foreign property owners to burst London &apos;s bubble
the Treasury have provisionally co@@ sted out the C@@ GT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne , who , in the 2012 Budget , introduced a 7 % rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £ 2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals .
already the stamp duty take for residential property in the bor@@ ou@@ ghs of Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea , which stood at £ 7@@ 08 million in the 2012 / 13 tax year , exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North East , North West and Yorkshire and the Hum@@ ber put together .
Mr Cook said : &quot; following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti @-@ avoidance legislation , it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under @-@ taxed irrespective of the effect of the out @-@ dated council tax system . &quot;
&quot; but this move could make some foreign investors retic@@ ent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell , &quot; he added .
Prime property - the top 5 % to 10 % of the housing market by price - in the affluent south @-@ west London belt , which stretches from Ful@@ ham to Wimbledon , has increased by a record 11.@@ 8 % over the past year .
prices in central London continued to show steady year @-@ on @-@ year growth of 5.6 % but were overshadowed by a burge@@ oning &quot; domestic market &quot; with the city &apos;s south west , north ( 7.4 % ) and east ( 6.5 % ) all experiencing an up@@ tick , according to research from Sav@@ ills .
scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog &apos;s tail are linked to its mood .
earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wa@@ g their tails more to the right ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while nervous dogs have a left @-@ dominated s@@ wish .
but now scientists say that fellow can@@ ines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences .
pro@@ f Georgi@@ o Vall@@ or@@ tig@@ ara , a neur@@ osci@@ enti@@ st from the University of Trento , said : &quot; it is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that inv@@ okes positive or negative emotions . &quot;
here we attempted to look at it in other species .
he added that just as in humans , for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left @-@ handed movement and vice versa , and the two h@@ emis@@ p@@ heres played different roles in emotions .
to find out more about how dogs react to the l@@ op @-@ sided tail w@@ ags of other dogs , the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs .
they measured the pets &apos; heart rates and analysed their behaviour .
it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other
pro@@ f Vall@@ or@@ tig@@ ara said : &quot; we presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a natur@@ alistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other con@@ founding issues , and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right . &quot;
when the animals saw an otherwise expres@@ sion@@ less dog move its tail to the right ( from the tail @-@ wag@@ ging dog &apos;s point of view ) , they stayed perfectly relaxed .
but when they spotted a tail ve@@ er predominantly to the left ( again from the tail @-@ s@@ wishing dog &apos;s point of view ) , their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious .
pro@@ f Vall@@ or@@ tig@@ ara said he didn &apos;t think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements .
instead , he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn &apos;t feel worried about .
he said : &quot; if you have several meetings with other dogs , and frequently their tail wag@@ ging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour , and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour , you respond on the basis of that experience . &quot;
the researchers say the findings could give owners , vets and trainers a better insight into their animal &apos;s emotions .
dog behaviour expert John Brad@@ sha@@ w , a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol &apos;s school of veterinary science , said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to can@@ ines .
last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog .
and in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada , he said : &quot; dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its &apos; tail &apos; was made to wa@@ g left rather than right , rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study . &quot;
he said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or rob@@ o @-@ dogs as can@@ ines .
a study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help , he explained .
&quot; while there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes , much of the detail still has to be ham@@ mer@@ ed out - and dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .
however , given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded , it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other .
Arctic Mon@@ keys postpone Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner &apos;s illness
rock band the Arctic Mon@@ keys have postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer was diagnosed with lar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis .
the Sheffield group were scheduled to perform at the Hydro venue in the city on Friday .
however , lead singer Alex Turner &apos;s illness has forced them to res@@ che@@ dule the show .
the band &apos;s announcement came after they were forced to similarly postpone a gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .
in a statement on their official website , the Arctic Mon@@ keys said : &quot; following the decision to postpone the show at the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical advice , Arctic Mon@@ keys must also postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday , November 1 . &quot;
&quot; Alex Turner has been diagnosed with lar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis and is regrettably not able to perform . &quot;
the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20 and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will now take place on November 21 .

Pope Francis to name first car@@ din@@ als in February
Pope Francis will create new car@@ din@@ als of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22 , the Vatican announced Thursday .
Car@@ din@@ als are the highest @-@ ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pop@@ e , and they &apos;re the ones who elect pop@@ es , so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor .
there are now 201 car@@ din@@ als .
however , once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pop@@ e -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot; cardinal electors . &quot;
in a statement announcing the news , Father Federico Lombar@@ di , a Vatican spokesman , said a meeting of all the existing car@@ din@@ als would be held before the ceremony to elev@@ ate the new car@@ din@@ als , known as a consist@@ ory .
&quot; Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to con@@ vo@@ ke February &apos;s consist@@ ory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of car@@ din@@ als from different parts of the world , &quot; Lombar@@ di said .
Jack Val@@ ero of Catholic Vo@@ ices said that by February , the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped .
he said usually a pop@@ e would name as many car@@ din@@ als as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many car@@ din@@ als aged over 80 as he wanted .
next year &apos;s consist@@ ory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year , Val@@ ero said .
at the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America , but they have a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
the car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Car@@ din@@ als , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church .
in the past the Pope decided everything on his own .
&quot; now Francis has selected these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him , &quot; Val@@ ero said .
he said it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that Francis would ask the car@@ din@@ als for advice .
but we &apos;ve not been in that situation before -- it &apos;s all completely new .
Val@@ ero said pop@@ es typically elevated bishops from large places to the position of cardinal but that Francis was &quot; full of surprises -- so we don &apos;t know who he &apos;ll name . &quot;
GM recalls some new pickup trucks in U.S. to fix se@@ at@@ backs
general Motors Co is recalling nearly 19@@ ,000 of its all @-@ new 2014 Chevrolet Silver@@ ado and GM@@ C Sierra pickup trucks to repair a problem with the manual rec@@ lining se@@ at@@ back , according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday .
on some of the trucks , the front seats may have a defect in the rec@@ lining mechanism .
as a result , the se@@ at@@ backs fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restraints .
&quot; if the vehicle is struck from behind , the head restraint may not properly protect occupants , increasing the risk of injury , &quot; according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website .
the recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10 .
GM &apos;s truck roll @-@ out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. autom@@ aker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring .
GM told truck owners about the defect in the first half of October .
N@@ HT@@ SA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16 @-@ day government shutdown , which tempered auto sales growth in October .
sales of the Silver@@ ado and Sierra trucks , which were redesigned for the 2014 model year , were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year , GM said on Friday .
in October , GM sold 4@@ 2,@@ 660 Silver@@ ado and 16,@@ 503 Sierra pickup trucks .
GM shares were up 1.4 percent at $ 3@@ 7.@@ 47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon .
an Obama voter &apos;s cry of despair
I voted for President Obama twice , sharing hope in possibility of change
he says Obama has had worthy efforts thwar@@ ted by G@@ OP obstruc@@ tion@@ ism
obstruc@@ tion@@ ism can &apos;t excuse Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are website wo@@ es , drone attacks
Obama &apos;s 2008 campaign mem@@ oir is a sad reminder of what might have been
Nath@@ an@@ iel P. Morris is a second @-@ year student at Harvard Medical School .
I &apos;m reading a terribly sad book these days .
it &apos;s a book that I thought would up@@ lift me during the dol@@ drums of second @-@ year medical school , and renew in me a sense of hope .
it &apos;s called &quot; The Au@@ d@@ acity to Win , &quot; and it &apos;s a mem@@ oir of Barack Obama &apos;s 2008 presidential campaign .
when I &apos;m finished with my patient write @-@ ups at night and get into bed , the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away .
the election turned out to be a land@@ slide , and news anch@@ ors paus@@ ed to reflect on the historic nature of the hour .
my class@@ mates cried with joy , and my parents saved every newspaper they could find .
a young team of vision@@ aries was headed for the White House , and the nation was ready for change .
during Obama &apos;s transition to office in 2008 , he had an 82 % approval rating .
and then I close the book .
cutting to the present is a rude awakening , like sn@@ apping out of a dream .
it &apos;s hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory , a sad reminder of opportunities gone by .
change indeed happened , in the years since I cast my first ballot .
it was simply nothing I could have imagined .
I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments , from the passage of the Af@@ for@@ dable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq , the end of &quot; don &apos;t ask don &apos;t tell , &quot; to the killing of Osama bin Laden .
moreover , I believe that partisan obstruc@@ tion@@ ism has up@@ ended too many efforts to push our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health care , and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay , among others .
but , after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers , I &apos;ve reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide .
I &apos;ve reached a point of political despair .
Republican obstruc@@ tion@@ ism cannot explain allowing the bu@@ gging of foreign leaders , nor having drones strike innocent children overseas .
it cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans , nor prosecuting whistle @-@ blowers who reveal government wrong@@ doing .
it cannot account for assassin@@ ating Anwar al @-@ Aw@@ l@@ aki , an American citizen , without a trial , nor shir@@ king public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns .
it cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House &apos;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration . &quot;
and , most recently , it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Af@@ for@@ dable Care Act was signed into law .
I don &apos;t know if this is what I should have expected .
if , at 18 years old , I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that prec@@ ede it .
obviously , el@@ ective office isn &apos;t a predictable course , as the opposing political party and random events , such as the New@@ town massacre , will shape our public conversation .
yet , of all of the examples that I have listed above , they largely seem to be of the administration &apos;s own choosing .
that is what troubles me most of all .
I voted for Obama again in 2012 , but not because I was excited by his candidacy .
Mit@@ t Romney presented a confusing and un@@ refined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions .
I felt that a second term for Obama , free from the pressures of future elections , would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long .
still , as Obama &apos;s approval rating sank below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder .
it makes me y@@ earn for the many promises that disappeared .
this week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary .
at a post @-@ mor@@ tem campaign meeting , he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause .
&quot; I want us to get our mo@@ jo back , &quot; he said .
we &apos;ve got to remember who we are . &apos;
it &apos;s five years later , Mr. President , and I couldn &apos;t agree with you more .
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nath@@ an@@ iel Morris .
C@@ live Pal@@ mer claims PM Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has conflict of interest over parental leave scheme
billi@@ on@@ aire MP C@@ live Pal@@ mer says Prime Minister Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it .
the mining magn@@ ate , who is in a dispute about paying a $ 6 million carbon tax bill , made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict .
the Pal@@ mer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are ax@@ ed .
but Mr Pal@@ mer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s daughters stood to personally benefit from policies .
&quot; he &apos;s got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant , he &apos;ll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not , &quot; Mr Pal@@ mer said .
two months after the election , the electoral commission officially declared Mr Pal@@ mer the winner of the Sun@@ shine Coast seat of Fair@@ fax by 53 votes , after a re@@ count .
Mr Pal@@ mer called for overhaul of election counting to speed up the process .
Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s daughters Fran@@ ces and Brid@@ get .
should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting ?
&quot; we need to have a better system , &quot; he said .
why is it that we shouldn &apos;t have a system where you can walk in , punch your details into a computer , vote immediately and have a result at 6.30 that night ?
Mr Pal@@ mer also criticised the use of pen@@ cils to mark ball@@ ots .
is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn &apos;t like it ?
in this day and age having a pencil seems extraordinary .
the Elec@@ toral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand .
Mr Pal@@ mer , 59 , said his policies included an international airport for the Sun@@ shine Coast and he would take &quot; very seriously &quot; his new job .
public office is about public service .
&quot; we seek no reward , except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community , &quot; he said .
R@@ BS suspen@@ ds two forex traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation , in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including UBS , Bar@@ cla@@ ys , Deutsche Bank and R@@ BS , have confirmed they are co @-@ operating with regulators in investigations into the world &apos;s largest financial market , where $ 5.@@ 3@@ t@@ n changes hands each day .
the two traders would be the first R@@ BS employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Lib@@ or inter@@ bank lending manipulation scandal .
the bank , which declined to comment on the sus@@ pensions , confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators .
&quot; our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co @-@ operating fully with the F@@ CA and our other regulators , &quot; the bank said two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation said that R@@ BS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator , the Financial Conduct Authority , sent to and from a former trader .
this trader , Richard U@@ sher , left R@@ BS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JP@@ Morgan .
Roh@@ an Ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of European spot trading at C@@ iti , went on leave this week , while Matt Gar@@ diner , a former senior currencies trader at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and UBS , was suspended by Standard Char@@ tered this week .
none of these traders have been accused of any wrong@@ doing .
Mr U@@ sher &apos;s instant message group included bankers at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and Ci@@ tig@@ roup , people close to the situation said .
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator , FIN@@ MA , said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks .
at least six authorities globally - the European Commission , FIN@@ MA , Switzerland &apos;s competition authority We@@ Ko , the F@@ CA , the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers coll@@ u@@ ded to move the currencies market .
HS@@ BC , Ci@@ tig@@ roup , JP@@ Morgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators , said people familiar with the situation .
banks are scour@@ ing through years &quot; worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrong@@ doing .
news about the probes has ratt@@ led traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks &apos; trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators .
some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate , but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true .
a senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks &quot; increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that &quot; you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices . &quot;
the news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $ 6m loss late last year .
the bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co @-@ operating with its regulators .
&quot; we are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained , &quot; Credit Suisse said .
ho@@ arding on the Bech@@ tle plot painted
a group belonging to the &quot; Schweizer Wiese &quot; citizen &apos;s initiative has given the ho@@ arding on the Bech@@ tle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b a face @-@ lift .
in addition , they have cleaned and widened the foot@@ path , a press release announced .
the planned covering of the di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated house to the rear of the plot was not permitted for safety reasons , as the premises were at risk of collapsing .
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the site , arranged the &apos; face @-@ lift &apos; in cooperation with his colleague , Reinhard Dom@@ ke , from the citizen &apos;s initiative .
before the citizen &apos;s initiative project , a banner with the message &quot; We are in favour &quot; was put up .
however , this did little to distract the 20 or so members of the citizen &apos;s initiative from their project .
their motto , on the large bill@@ board stated &quot; We are against unfinished buildings . &quot;
in so doing they wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Schweizer Wiese - should the huge project one day fail .
chatting with many people passing by the &quot; construction site , &quot; it became clear that many citizens believe the execution of the project would make things much better for the town , although many have the same questions as the citizen &apos;s initiative regarding the scale of the planned project .
however , they are beginning to resign themselves as the town continues to stall in providing answers , said a statement from the citizen &apos;s initiative .
we have now been told that the public statements made by the Mayor are also having an impact .
in May , in the meeting of the Town Council , he said that he feared for the outcome of the spa should the population vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Schweizer Wiese in the local referendum .
some appear utterly frightened by it , others perceive it as a &quot; blatant attempt to blackmail &quot; the population , continued the press release from the citizen &apos;s initiative .
the citizen &apos;s initiative thanked those who donated paint and all those who lent a hand .
Ran@@ gn@@ ick sc@@ ol@@ ding for ref@@ s : man@@ e is no diver
as satisfied as Ralf Ran@@ gn@@ ick is with the present winning form of the Austrian Bundesliga table @-@ top@@ pers , Red Bull Salzburg , the Sporting Director of the &quot; Bul@@ ls &quot; expressed equal disappointment with the refer@@ ees .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous trend , with Man@@ e and Alan being dubbed as &apos; divers &apos; , &quot; he said at a press conference in Sal@@ burg on Thursday , in defence of the two tricky offensive players .
the most recent cause for Ran@@ gn@@ ick &apos;s criticism was the yellow card for Man@@ e at 3 : 0 against Grö@@ dig last Sunday , whereby the Seneg@@ alese stri@@ ker was penalised for supposed play acting - admittedly this was not justified , as shown by TV footage .
&quot; a blatant wrong decision , &quot; commented Ran@@ gn@@ ick , who referred to Hark@@ am as being &quot; completely out of his depth . &quot;
Hark@@ am also played &quot; his part &quot; in the escalation between Salzburg Coach Roger Schmidt and Grö@@ dig Trainer A@@ di H@@ üt@@ ter after the game .
he firmly defended his German compatri@@ ot : &quot; in each individual situation I would have behaved in the same way as Roger Schmidt . &quot;
Schmidt himself did not wish to have any contact with his colleagues after the skir@@ mis@@ h with H@@ üt@@ ter .
I do not know why .
&quot; after all , I was the one who was insul@@ ted , &quot; emphasised the 46 @-@ year @-@ old .
however , with regard to the winning run , Ran@@ gn@@ ick sang his team &apos;s praises .
&quot; there are only two words for it : really good , &quot; he stated .
there is not a lot you can criticise .
most of all , the manner in which the team is playing is impressive .
we must stay composed and keep it up .
there will hardly be any squad changes in the winter transfer window .
there is no major reason to change anything .
&quot; unless a player comes forward and expresses the desire to leave the club , &quot; explained Ran@@ gn@@ ick .
Supreme Court upholds Obama health care law
in a major victory for the Obama administration , the US Supreme Court today ruled Barack Obama &apos;s signature health care law is constitutional .
by a 5 @-@ 4 vote , the justices ruled the Patient Protection and Af@@ for@@ dable Care Act &apos;s individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the taxing power of the government .
chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while Jus@@ tices Sc@@ alia , Thomas , Ali@@ to and Kennedy dis@@ s@@ ented .
the court also upheld the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 page law , and further held that the health care law &apos;s requirement that states increase Medic@@ aid eligibility or else lose all federal Medic@@ aid funding is not un@@ constitu@@ tionally coerci@@ ve .
the suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .
the law was vigorously opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season , including presum@@ ptive nominee Mit@@ t Romney .
Norway : Norwegian village lights itself up with huge mirrors
using huge mirrors , the residents of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dre@@ ary valley .
due to the low level of sunshine , from autumn until spring the village of R@@ ju@@ kan in the Vest@@ fjord valley normally langu@@ ishes in the shadows of the surrounding mountains .
with three gigantic mirrors , each 45 metres tall , a centuries @-@ old dream came true on Wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &apos; , ra@@ ved Mayor Stein@@ ar Ber@@ gs@@ land at the inaugural ceremony , telev@@ ised by broad@@ caster TV@@ 2 .
some valley residents lay back on sun loungers , while others safely put on their sung@@ lasses .
up until now , those hungry for sunshine in the winter had to travel to a nearby peak by cable car .
ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal of directing the sun into the valley using mirrors .
however , this basic idea had been talked of in the location since 1913 .
after several years of debate , the Town Council finally approved the project , which cost 5 million kr@@ one ( around EUR 6@@ 15,000 ) .
a similar construction has provided sunshine to the Italian alpine resort of Vig@@ an@@ ella for a number of years .
the post is hardly ever emp@@ tied on Sundays
&quot; many citizens will not yet have noticed that red dots indicating a Sunday post collection are still to be found on many post boxes in the town centre and its districts . however , if you read the small print on the yellow boxes operated by Post AG , you will quickly find out that the boxes are no longer emp@@ tied on Sundays and holidays , &quot; announced the FDP .
an inquiry by the FDP confirmed this .
only the post boxes in front of the post office building at Ernst @-@ Ludwig @-@ Straße 36 and at Jakob @-@ Müller @-@ Straße 1 in Hütten@@ feld are still emp@@ tied .
whether there are still Sunday collections in Hof@@ heim and Rosengarten is not addressed in the inquiry by the FDP .
the FDP spokesperson for social and youth @-@ related affairs , Fritz Rö@@ hren@@ beck wants to dig deeper into this .
the Sunday collection is an important postal service , especially in the case of scheduled post .
&quot; the company is radically and unacceptably cutting back on this , despite the price increase for letters in January 2013 .
Thomas B@@ itt@@ ner , Liberal Party Parliamentary Group and Municipal Association Chairman , is supporting his fellow group members : &quot; what anno@@ ys me , is the fact that the collection times have been changed or cancelled on the quiet here . &quot;
in so doing , the postal service is miles off the mark when it comes to public accessibility .
&quot; at least the post boxes in the districts of Neu@@ sch@@ loß and Rosengarten must still be emp@@ tied on Sundays , &quot; said B@@ itt@@ ner and Rö@@ hren@@ beck in un@@ ison .
it is also the case for the town centre that those citizens in particular who are not mobile must also be able to access a post box with a Sunday collection on foot .
in the Town Parliament , Rö@@ hren@@ beck asked whether the Town Council was planning discussions with the postal service regarding this matter .
Mayor Erich Mai@@ er responded that the postal service had not communicated with Lam@@ per@@ theim .
to the best of his knowledge , however , there is a Sunday collection in Hof@@ heim .
their party has spoken out in favour of privatisation .
&quot; decisions will then be made elsewhere , &quot; said Mai@@ er .
Frankfurt parking fees to increase dramatically
parking in Frankfurt could soon be noticeably more expensive .
the City Magist@@ rate today discussed a submission by the head of the department for transport , Stefan Maj@@ er ( Green Party ) .
according to the proposal , parking fees are to be increased by 50 per cent .
this increase will not , however , be the result of raised prices , but rather the fact that time interval permitted by parking meters and ticketing machines will be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes .
the City Council must reach a decision on this in December .
the Retail Committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Industry and Commerce believes that this is &quot; not a good idea . &quot;
the option of parking right outside their businesses is &quot; an advantage to smaller retailers that must not be underestimated .. &quot;
the Verkehr@@ sclub Deutschland ( German Traffic Club ) is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is &quot; completely appropriate and actually long overdue . &quot;
local public transport will also become more expensive .
Freu@@ den@@ stadt : quick moves take hosts by surprise
with a s@@ lender squad , the T@@ SV Freu@@ den@@ stadt Herren I team ( Men &apos;s First Team ) stepped into the Schiller School Gymnasium in Reut@@ lingen to face TG Gön@@ n@@ ingen of the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b region .
the Al@@ b men stood on the other side of the net with what was undoubtedly a more experienced team .
however , it soon became evident that , due in part to their age , they could not really keep up with the fast pace of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt team .
Gön@@ n@@ ingen found it extremely difficult to cope with the hard and well @-@ positioned offensive moves .
they repeatedly missed the passes and attacks coming clean@@ ly over the net from Simon Schen@@ k and Eduard Schulz and their blocking game was not up to scratch .
clear victories in the first two sets clearly demonstrated the superiority of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt team in all areas .
faced with this overwhelming and match @-@ determining performance , the third set was won following a somewhat t@@ ame and spirit@@ less performance , for a final score of 3 : 0 ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
on 2 November , when they play TV Ba@@ ier@@ s@@ bronn , who managed a clear victory in Nag@@ old , they will step onto the court to face a much stronger opponent .
T@@ SV Freu@@ den@@ stadt I : Dominik Bäu@@ er@@ le , Y@@ ann@@ ik Bü@@ ch@@ le , Sebastian D@@ öl@@ ker , Felix P@@ äl@@ chen , Stefan R@@ äl@@ ler , Simon Schen@@ k and Eduard Schulz .
in the B Class , two teams from Ba@@ ier@@ s@@ bronn and Freu@@ den@@ stadt faced off in the M@@ urg@@ tal@@ halle in Ba@@ ier@@ s@@ bronn .
they produced a hard @-@ fought two @-@ hour match .
nerves on both sides , particularly when receiving the ball , resulted in errors and lost points ; there was even a lack of passing at times and at some critical moments over@@ eag@@ ern@@ ess saw potential points wasted .
however , in this evenly matched game , the great physical effort of Marcus Blas@@ utto &apos;s T@@ SV team proved decisive in spite of tremendous commitment by both teams .
maintenance day at the small &apos; Eng@@ länder@@ h@@ üt@@ te@@ &apos;
for what was then the fifth maintenance day in the follow @-@ up to the Natura 2000 project in Upper Hot@@ zen@@ wald , a group of dedicated participants met at the small Eng@@ länder@@ hütte ( English@@ man &apos;s Cottage ) in I@@ bach
following suggestions from the population , the of the valley in the area of the cottage was to be cleared , said Mayor Helmut Kaiser .
according to Kaiser , many hikers refer to this area as the show@@ piece of the Schlu@@ chten@@ steig , where the landscape provides the ideal framework for fantastic views .
he thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasised that the maintenance day is a suitable instrument through which to strengthen the connection between people and nature ,
he is offering every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself .
at the same time as the tourist aspect , environmental aspects should also be taken into consideration .
this environmental aspect was explained by Fri@@ e@@ deri@@ ke Tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it of the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Regional Council , following the greeting by Regional Coun@@ cill@@ or Til@@ man Boll@@ acher , who had taken on the role of patron and wished the campaign every success .
according to Tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it , the tourist objective of the vision coincided with the goal of preserving the now extremely over@@ grown old All@@ mend grazing pasture , with its specific protected habitats , through its opening and connection to the still existing grazing land .
certain species , such as rare butter@@ flies or gr@@ as@@ shoppers , cannot get past barriers in the form of forest areas .
they require these clear pathways in order to preserve their species .
Tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it said that she did not want to fail to use this opportunity to say a word in defence of the planned bio@@ sphere area .
the current measures do not integrate seamlessly into these plans .
a bio@@ sphere area offers the chance for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status , and thus offers an extension to what has been achieved thus far with the Life Project and the previous care days .
after the various statements , forest ran@@ ger Christoph W@@ ehle and Life Project manager Corn@@ elia Bisch@@ off divided the helpers into groups .
the larger trees had been cut down in advance , although forest tractors were on @-@ call if required .
one group of helpers were to take care of the clearance of juni@@ per bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone wall .
the objective was to create a clear view at the viewpoint .
L@@ öff@@ ingen : K@@ öpf@@ ler still the only candidate
information online : although L@@ öff@@ ingen , the small town of Ba@@ ar , with its 7,@@ 5@@ 14 residents , can be described as having an intact infrastructure , forward @-@ looking school , youth and senior citizens policies and its own municipal energy companies , thus far no @-@ one has registered as a second may@@ oral candidate .
so far , the only candidate to succeed Mayor Norbert Bru@@ g@@ ger , who is no longer running on account of his age , is 46 @-@ year @-@ old banker and business economist Dieter K@@ öpf@@ ler from L@@ öff@@ ingen .
the deadline for applications is Monday 11 November , at 6 : 00 p.m.
Google , Samsung , Hu@@ a@@ wei su@@ ed over Nor@@ tel patents
the group that owns thousands of former Nor@@ tel patents filed a bar@@ rage of patent law@@ suits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google , the company it out@@ bid in the Nor@@ tel bankruptcy auction .
Rock@@ star , the consortium that bought the Nor@@ tel patents for $ 4.5 billion , su@@ ed Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Cor@@ p , Hu@@ a@@ wei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas .
Rock@@ star is jointly owned by Apple , Microsoft , Blackberry , Ericsson and Sony .
Google is accused of infringing seven patents .
the patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising , the lawsuit said , which is the core of Google &apos;s search business .
representatives for Samsung , Hu@@ a@@ wei , HTC and Rock@@ star could not immediately be reached .
Samsung , Hu@@ a@@ wei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google &apos;s Android operating system , which compet@@ es fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products .
in 2011 Google placed an initial $ 900 million bid for Nor@@ tel &apos;s patents .
Google increased its bid several times , ultimately offering as much as $ 4.4 billion .
after losing out to Rock@@ star on the Nor@@ tel patents , Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a deal driven partly by Motorola &apos;s library of patents .
&quot; despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents @-@ in @-@ suit at auction , Google has infringed and continues to infringe , &quot; the lawsuit said .
Rock@@ star is seeking increased damages against Google , as it claims Google &apos;s patent infringement is will@@ ful , according to the complaint .
Egypt swe@@ ars in first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt .
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a &quot; new Egypt &quot; as he took the oath of office to become the country &apos;s first freely elected president , succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ou@@ sted 16 months ago .
at his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi also became the Arab world &apos;s first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he took the oath before the court &apos;s 18 black @-@ ro@@ bed judges in its Nile @-@ side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple .
&quot; we aspire to a better tomorrow , a new Egypt and a second republic , &quot; Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television .
&quot; today , the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said Morsi , a 60 @-@ year @-@ old US @-@ trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an out@@ law@@ ed organisation harsh@@ ly targeted by successive governments .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11@@ am local time in a small motor@@ cade .
only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and , in a departure from the presidential pom@@ p of the Mubarak years , traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motor@@ cade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs .
deri@@ ded as the Brotherhood &apos;s un@@ charismatic &quot; spare tyre , &quot; his personal prestige has sur@@ ged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak .
&quot; Egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; Morsi , wearing a blue business suit and a red tie , told the judges in the wood @-@ pan@@ elled chamber where he took the oath of office .
Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address .
he was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention .
military ruler Field Marsh@@ al Hussein Tan@@ ta@@ wi was in attendance .
his arrival was greeted with ch@@ ants of , &quot; The army and the people are one hand , &quot; from the hundreds gathered in the university &apos;s main lecture room .
established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s .
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tah@@ rir Square , birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak &apos;s authoritarian rule last year , and v@@ owed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over from the ou@@ sted leader .
but by agreeing to take the official oath before the court , rather than before parliament as is customary , he is b@@ owing to the military &apos;s will in an indication that the contest for power will continue .
Morsi &apos;s speech in Tah@@ rir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures .
Falken@@ berg club makes for two wonderful evenings .

worker falls from ladder : seriously injured
on Thursday , a 51 @-@ year @-@ old worker in Eg@@ gel@@ sberg fell from a ladder while replacing a broken external sensor and was seriously injured .
the man from Lamp@@ recht@@ shausen wanted to replace a broken heating sensor on the external facade of a guest house .
as he was climbing the ladder , which was resting on the roof gut@@ tering , it slipped away and the man fell onto the concrete below .
he suffered serious injuries and was taken by the &quot; Christ@@ oph@@ or@@ us 6 &quot; rescue helicopter to the Salzburg Regional Hospital .
rap@@ ist in South Africa : two life sentences
nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl in South Africa , the perpetr@@ ator was condemned to two life sentences on Friday .
this was reported by broad@@ caster S@@ ABC .
the victim later died as a result of the serious injuries .
Johannes K@@ ana had already been found guilty of the crime at the start of the week .
the crime had caused nationwide horror .
the then 21 @-@ year @-@ old had raped an@@ ene Boo@@ y@@ sen in February in an industrial estate in Bre@@ das@@ dor@@ p , near Cap@@ etown .
for 14 hours , doctors batt@@ led to save the life of the victim , ultimately in vain .
the sight of the young girl was so horrific that the carers and nursing staff required psychological support .
during the trial , K@@ ana admitted to having been in a bar with Boo@@ y@@ sen on the night of the attack .
he also admitted to beating and rap@@ ing her , however he denied being responsible for the death of the girl .
the police had initially assumed that there were multiple attackers , however , they released two suspects from custody as the evidence against them was insufficient .
during the proceedings the public prosecution also emphasised that they were convinced that K@@ ana was alone at the time of the attack .
rapes are almost part of everyday life in South Africa : there are around 64@@ ,000 reports of sexual assault every year .
this is almost ten times as many as in Germany , although with a population of 82 million people , Germany has a much higher number of residents than South Africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s associations in South Africa , however , estimate the number of unreported cases of sexual assault to be 10 @-@ 25 times as high .
Jumbo visits the home of Black Forest ham
Jumbo on the search for the &quot; world &apos;s best ham &quot; : for the TV programme &quot; Galileo , &quot; the Pro@@ 7 star visited Bon@@ n@@ dorf .
the presenter established one thing right from the outset : the most important thing when it comes to ham are the legs of pork - turbo f@@ atten@@ ing does not provide a good basis for this .
can ham bought in a supermarket be as good as a quality product ?
U@@ li , boss of the large ham factory in Schwarzwald , explained to Jumbo how the Bon@@ n@@ dorf company , &quot; Adler , &quot; operates .
&quot; Germany &apos;s most @-@ loved ham , &quot; said Jumbo , presenting the Black Forest ham .
he could only enter the factory when wearing hair protection and a white coat .
Jumbo also had to first disinf@@ ect his hands before he could reach for the microphone .
Jumbo seen getting something to keep him going at a fast food restaurant in Wald@@ shut
&quot; here they work with huge quantities , &quot; commented the television producers , astonished by the mass production of Black Forest ham .
16@@ ,000 joints of meat per week speak for themselves .
weight , fat content and colour : U@@ li explained what was required for the best quality .
the majority of the pigs are slaughtered at six months old .
television with standards ?
even specific details such as the pH value of the meat play a role .
the darker the meat , the higher the pH value .
&quot; I would be curious what would happen if you were to measure Roberto Blanco , &quot; said Jumbo cyn@@ ically .
here the standard of private television production is presented in its pur@@ est form .
nonetheless , it is worth watching .
the viewer sees that joints are still carved by hand .
after all : black Forest ham traditionally arrives on the shelf bon@@ eless .
the secret of the ham is the mix of herbs combined with salt .
the appearance of the smoking tower and furnace remind Jumbo of a submarine .
the trick : here fir branches in the smoker provide the special flavour of Black Forest ham .
after 20 days in the smoke , the ham is finally almost black .
&quot; and now the slice will disappear inside Jumbo , &quot; he said , announcing his sampling of the product .
&quot; that is really delicious , &quot; said the TV star in conclusion .
all those involved will be happy with that evaluation .
thought travel agents were a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight Centre seem to be bu@@ cking the trend .
the company has upgraded its full year profit forecast and is looking to record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
the travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $ 325 million and $ 340 million , compared with the $ 305 million to $ 315 million it previously forecast .
if the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $ 29@@ 0.4 million profit it achieved in 2011 / 12 .
managing director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and had started the second half strongly especially in Australian and UK non @-@ business travel .
&quot; year @-@ to @-@ date , our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full @-@ year earnings before interest and tax contributions , &quot; he said .
this includes Australia and the United Kingdom , which are typically our largest profit generators .
in Australia the leisure business re@@ bounded during the second half which offset a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market .
similarly in the UK , Flight Centre &apos;s leisure business performed well while corporate clients were spending less .
its US business had recovered its losses during its season@@ ally weaker first half and was expected to deliver its third consecutive full year profit .
flight Centre shares were up 3@@ c at $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .
schools urged to focus more on ma@@ ths , spelling and grammar
English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play , a 19th century novel , Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards .
the exam will also feature &quot; un@@ seen texts &quot; to encourage wider reading ;
a combined English literature and language course will be scrapped .
from 2015 , pupils will be required to take a standalone G@@ C@@ SE in language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .
the Department for Education is due to release the new syll@@ abuses in English and ma@@ ths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul .
it will make changes in other core subjects next year .
in a separate move , O@@ f@@ qu@@ al , the exams regulator , will un@@ veil a shake @-@ up of the structure of G@@ C@@ SE@@ s , with a new grading system and less cour@@ se@@ work .
speaking in the summer , Michael Go@@ ve , the Education Secretary , said there was a &quot; widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , &quot; insisting G@@ C@@ SE@@ s would be &quot; more challenging , more ambitious and more rigorous . &quot;
studies show that English schools devote less time to ma@@ ths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries .
by comparison , Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and pupils do around 138 hours in Singapore .
while there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to ma@@ ths , Coalition sources said the extensive ma@@ ths G@@ C@@ SE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching .
the syll@@ ab@@ us will place a greater focus on &quot; real world problems , &quot; including financial mathematics .
beautiful animals and delicious tar@@ ts entice
the most beautiful rab@@ bits of various breeds and colour@@ ings will be presented at the District Exhibition this weekend in the community centre .

SALEM : Johanna Rah@@ ner at the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Disc@@ ussion Forum
at the next E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Disc@@ ussion Forum on Monday 21 October , in the Neues Museum des Schlosses ( New Castle Museum ) , the focus will be on the topic of &quot; To hell with Hell - The@@ ological reflections on how we now approach the notion of end times . &quot;
the speaker will be Johanna Rah@@ ner .
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Disc@@ ussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches in Sal@@ em , the Sal@@ em Castle and the Lake Constance District Cultural Office .
at the forum , Johanna Rah@@ ner wants to address the question of how people today view the &quot; end times &quot; after death .
while people in past centuries were overly conscious of it , focusing on the pictures of heaven and hell &quot; that up until now have defined our ideas , &quot; contemporary proph@@ etic teaching on the hope of consum@@ mation is characterised more by a certain bas@@ h@@ fulness , or even spe@@ ech@@ lessness .
&quot; the greater hope has been well and truly cast out of Christians by religious critics , &quot; said the speaker .
they have &quot; provided us with so many question marks , that we seem to have lost our exc@@ lamation marks . &quot;
Johanna Rah@@ ner continued : &quot; however , the crucial challenge to this remains fear of death . &quot;
associated with this is the matter of that longing , &quot; that dreams that everything will be good at the end . &quot;
Johanna Rah@@ ner , born in 1962 in Baden @-@ Baden , studied Catholic theology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert Ludwig &apos;s University in Freiburg .
in 1997 she graduated as a doctor of theology , also in Freiburg .
a post @-@ doctoral lec@@ turing qualification in fundamental theology and ec@@ umen@@ ical theology followed in 2003 at the West@@ f@@ alian Wilhelm &apos;s University .
since 2010 , Johanna Rah@@ ner has occupied a Chair for System@@ atic The@@ ology in the Institute for Catholic The@@ ology at the University of Kassel .
Gei@@ s@@ lingen : more than 100 young Catholics from Kl@@ einer Heu@@ berg stand together in the confirmation of their profession of faith
in two services , 101 15 and 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from the Am Kleinen Heu@@ berg pastoral care unit were confirmed .
in the morning , the service was accompanied by the Lau@@ dato @-@ Si Group , while the afternoon service featured &apos; The Spirit &apos; youth choir .
upon receiving the confirmation sac@@ r@@ ament , the young people accepted their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit .
over recent months those being confirmed , under the direction of De@@ acon R@@ einer Deh@@ ner and the assistance of several church members , have been preparing for the special day .
in various projects , they learned of the different tasks involved in Christian church life and attended the Youth Day in Unter@@ macht@@ al together .
Ill@@ men@@ see : second mountain bike race enth@@ uses participants
in fantastic weather , 214 cyclists came to Ill@@ men@@ see to take on the circuit , over the hills and around the lake .
this was announced by Ulrich Kno@@ bel of the organising Ill@@ men@@ see Sports Club .
among the participants there were also numerous amateur cyclists who wanted the chance to practice their hobby in a competitive environment , in particular over the short distance of 15 kilometres with a 300 metre climb .
two top @-@ class junior cyclists were also in the starting line @-@ up for the competition : Felix B@@ ader from Bad Wald@@ see and Pascal Tre@@ ub@@ el from A@@ ach @-@ Linz came with the recommendation of having achieved good positions at the German Championships .
the pair managed to break away from the field in keeping with expectations .
as was the case the previous year , Felix B@@ ader managed to hold on to a small lead right to the end and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance race
once again , Pascal Tre@@ ub@@ el took second place .
in the ladies &apos; race it was Ther@@ esa Du@@ elli of Team Alb@@ traum who managed to take top place on the podium .
in second and third places were Anne Adel from Ill@@ men@@ see and Leon@@ ie Treiber from O@@ win@@ gen .
the increasing number of riders that live or work in the area is a fantastic development .
and it was not only about top performance - the entire range of athletic ability was represented .
participants &apos; ages were also wide @-@ ranging , with the youngest starters at ten years old up to the oldest at over 70 .
this year , there were even more absolute top athletes at the starting line for the main race .
four cyclists managed to break away from the top regional rac@@ ers .
these included Philipp Pan@@ ger@@ l , a semi @-@ professional mountain bi@@ ker from the Black Tus@@ k Racing Team .
together with a team mate , Pan@@ ger@@ l has already twice been crowned World Champion in the 12 @-@ hour race .
this year he became European Champion in this special discipline .
also competing was Roland B@@ aller@@ stedt , who has already claimed two German du@@ athlon championships .
after 45 kilometres and a climb of 900 metres , the leading riders were neck and neck on the final straight in front of the Drei @-@ Seen @-@ Hall .
Pan@@ ger@@ l sp@@ ed over the finish line in first place .
only one second later , the experienced B@@ aller@@ stedt managed to take second place in the overall stand@@ ings .
Hermann and War@@ th@@ mann then reached the finish line simultaneously to take joint third in the overall stand@@ ings .
in the ladies &apos; race , Christi@@ ane Coh@@ smann achieved the fastest time in the main race .
Are@@ ane B@@ ler@@ sch from Bin@@ zw@@ angen took second place , ahead of Nat@@ asch@@ a Werner from Stuttgart .
athletes and assistants seemed very satisfied with the smooth and well @-@ organised running of the event .
trekking through mud , rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges B@@ welle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon
B@@ welle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
there aren &apos;t many doctors in the west African country ; just one for every 5,000 people
cast your vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges B@@ welle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013 .
you can vote for him , or any of the other top 10 Heroes , to be CNN Hero of the Year .
that person will receive $ 250,000 to continue their extraordinary work .
for 21 years , Georges B@@ welle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness , traveling to hospitals that weren &apos;t equipped to help him .
J@@ ame@@ f B@@ welle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Ya@@ o@@ unde , Cameroon &apos;s capital .
he suffered only a broken arm at first , but an infection developed and spread to his brain , creating a hem@@ atom@@ a that would affect him for the rest of his life .
&quot; there were no neur@@ o@@ surgeons in Cameroon , &quot; Georges B@@ welle said .
we would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money .
instead , B@@ welle spent years escor@@ ting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals , getting whatever treatment they could get .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy , &quot; B@@ welle said .
you can leave home at 5 a.m. , running to the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
there are a lot of patients .
some people can die because they are waiting .
the situation hasn &apos;t changed much since B@@ welle &apos;s father passed away in 2002 .
in Cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .
for comparison &apos;s sake , the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 4@@ 13 people .
and even if they could see a physician , many Camero@@ onians couldn &apos;t afford it .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three @-@ quarters of the country &apos;s health @-@ care spending is private .
&quot; the only problem they have is poverty , &quot; B@@ welle said .
and with poverty , they cannot enjoy their life .
seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer , B@@ welle was determined to do something about it .
Dr. Georges B@@ welle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free sur@@ geries in the past year .
he became a doctor himself , working as a vascular surgeon in Ya@@ o@@ unde &apos;s Central Hospital .
and he started a non@@ profit , AS@@ CO@@ V@@ IME , that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32@@ ,000 people .
almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people jam into vans , tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need .
their luck doesn &apos;t always hold out .
they &apos;ve had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once .
but when they arrive , they receive a true heroes &apos; welcome : a feast , singing and dancing , and the best accommodations the community can offer .
in these villages , free medical care is truly a cause for celebration , and B@@ welle -- with his big smile and bound@@ less energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun .
the next morning , the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients .
&quot; we are receiving 500 people in each trip , &quot; B@@ welle said .
they are coming from 60 kilometers around the village , and they &apos;re coming on foot .
each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care .
many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
others might receive cr@@ ut@@ ches , a pair of donated ey@@ eg@@ lasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that &apos;s required for school but that many impoverished families simply can &apos;t afford .
in the evenings , the team will do simple sur@@ geries with local an@@ es@@ thesia .
operations are usually done in a school@@ house , town hall or home ; after the procedure , patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person .
with the group &apos;s generator lighting the operating room and san@@ iti@@ zing equipment , B@@ welle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning .
it &apos;s a back@@ breaking pace , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .
&quot; they are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work , &quot; B@@ welle said .
on Sunday , the team heads back to the city , tired but proud of their work .
the group -- a mix of Camero@@ onian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free sur@@ geries in the past year , and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help .
one man explained that the free her@@ nia surgery he &apos;d received will allow him to work again .
&quot; this will change my future with my family , &quot; the man said .
in addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon , B@@ welle also works nights at private medical clinics around Ya@@ o@@ unde .
it &apos;s this second job , he said , that funds about 60 % of his non@@ profit ; the rest is covered by private donations .
&quot; I &apos;m not sure when he sleeps , &quot; said K@@ atie O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , a second @-@ year medical student from Dre@@ xel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with B@@ welle &apos;s group .
he is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns .
for medical and nursing students such as O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , who come from the United States and Europe to join B@@ welle on his missions , it &apos;s a hands @-@ on opportunity they &apos;d never get at home .
&quot; we &apos;ve been able to scru@@ b in on sur@@ geries where we help blo@@ t blood away or hold tools for Dr. B@@ welle , &quot; O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said .
that &apos;s not something you &apos;d ever get to do in America as a second @-@ year medical student .
the student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon , often arriving with donated medical supplies .
but once they arrive in Ya@@ o@@ unde , their board , transportation and instruction are covered by B@@ welle .
&quot; he &apos;s a hero , without a doubt , &quot; O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said .
he gives his life to this organization , and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting .
for B@@ welle , the near @-@ constant workload isn &apos;t a hardship .
helping others live happier lives , fulfilling a promise he made to his father , is something that brings him great joy .
&quot; I am so happy when I am doing this work , &quot; B@@ welle said .
and I think about my father .
I hope he sees what I am doing .
to make people laugh , to reduce the pain , that &apos;s why I &apos;m doing this .
check out the AS@@ CO@@ V@@ IME website and see how to help .
mastering the struggle to perfection .
the role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway &apos;s novel &quot; The Old Man and the Sea , &quot; is perfectly suited to Horst Jan@@ son .
Jan@@ son is an old hand himself when it comes to his profession , the art of acting .
the old man , Santiago , is the best there is when it comes to fishing .
as such , the pair complement one another superbly .
you almost think that you can see the folds in the old man &apos;s neck , of which young fisherman Man@@ olo speaks .
when Santiago sits arch@@ ed over on the chair , tired of life , this is a genuine emotion for Jan@@ son .
furthermore , the role of the old fisherman is a character role , through and through , which Jan@@ son masters excellently .
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who doesn &apos;t give up and who ultimately wins the battle against the fish as a result of his knowledge and his strong will .
for long periods , Jan@@ son is the only performer on the stage .
he manages to focus the audience &apos;s attention on himself , with the result that his mon@@ olo@@ gues never become boring , not even for just a moment .
his efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that members of the audience forget that the sea in question consists merely of water bottles , illuminated in blue .
director Jens Has@@ sel@@ mann has the old man in the boat perform in front of Fischerdorf .
during the course of the performance he has the respective active scene illuminated . Santiago &apos;s cabin and the bar of singer Marie @-@ Lu@@ ise Gunst , who sings of the Cuban lifestyle , with your songs and beautiful voice .
the four musicians accompany with Cuban rhythms and guests at the bar at the same time .
tourism : descent to the Romans
beneath Cologne , a sewage channel from Roman times , measuring around 120 metres in length , has been preserved .
anyone visiting Cologne cannot miss the cathedral .
the two towers , measuring around 157 metres , extend into the heavens , making it Europe &apos;s second tallest church building .
however , only a few visitors who marvel at the two ornate church towers realise that there is much to discover beneath the cathedral .
Rainer Schulze is an expert when it comes to the Cologne under@@ world .
the meeting point for his tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Centre , right at the cathedral .
the tour begins in a somewhat un@@ spectacular fashion : &quot; we begin in the underground car park , &quot; says Schulze .
in the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a car @-@ friendly city , and therefore the only sections of the old city wall that remain are those that were not too tall .
the majority of the users of the parking garage therefore now hurry past the Roman relics and simply drop off their car .
however , anyone who takes a closer look on parking level D2 will discover an archaeological site , cord@@ oned off by metal rail@@ ings .
ruins measuring five metres tall , made from stones around the size of the palm of your hand , are waiting to be discovered .
&quot; these are remnants of the Roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century A.@@ D , &quot; explains Schulze .
before returning to daylight , Schulze has participants take a glance into a dark , 15 @-@ metre shaft on the upper parking level .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which is barely noticed at all these days .
the next stop on the tour is the Praet@@ orium , where participants once again descend to the depths .
here we find the residence of what was once the most powerful man to the north of the Alps , the Praet@@ or of the C@@ CA@@ A .
one visitor wants to know what C@@ CA@@ A means .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; Colonia Claudia Ar@@ a Agri@@ pp@@ inen@@ si@@ um , &quot; which is basically amounts to &quot; City under Roman Law and City of the Agri@@ pp@@ in@@ ians , founded under Emperor Claudius at the Site of the Al@@ tars for the Imperial Cul@@ t . &quot;
and the Praet@@ orium refers to the former Governor &apos;s Palace and the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .
from the exhibition vesti@@ bu@@ le , a tunnel leads to the preserved Roman se@@ wer , measuring around 120 metres in length .
&quot; if you want you can take a peaceful stroll along a section of the so @-@ called Clo@@ aca Maxim@@ a , &quot; says Schulze , encouraging the guests .
Schulze has one more surprise .
once he has collected the key from the information desk , he leads the group to a 16 @-@ metre , accessible shaft .
&quot; we are now in the Mik@@ we , a ritual Jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the Jewish congregation built their bath deep into the ground in order to reach the groundwater essential for ritual washing .
to this day the differing water levels caused by the varying levels of the Rhine can be read at the lower end of the Mik@@ we , the origins of which trace back to the eighth century .
the Mik@@ we is to form part of an archaeological area at the Town Hall Square , on which construction work is set to begin shortly .
however , it will be a few years before it is complete .
leg almost h@@ acked off : ro@@ cker re@@ trial
a bloody attack within the &apos; Ro@@ cker &apos; scene is to be re @-@ investigated after more than four years .
proceedings for attempted murder , griev@@ ous bodily harm and material damage , brought against two 30 @-@ year @-@ olds have begun before the Frankfurt District Court .
they are being accompanied by strict security precautions .
the accused initially remained silent .
they are said to have been active within the Ro@@ cker scene and to have at the time belonged to the ban@@ di@@ dos .
the Public Prosecutor accused them of having stab@@ bed and beaten three men in a car in Fin@@ ow@@ furt , together with unknown ac@@ complic@@ es .
all the victims were seriously injured , with one man almost losing a leg .
the victims were said to have belonged to the competing gang , the Hell &apos;s Angels .
one is said to have been a high @-@ ranking member from Berlin .
it seems that the attack was preceded by a car chase involving several cars .
according to accusations , this was part of a turf war and represented a demonstration of power .
the two accused were acqu@@ itted in an initial trial at the beginning of 2012 .
at the time , a speaker for the court said that it could not be proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feu@@ d .
the ass@@ ail@@ ants had worn masks and had not been recognised .
the Federal Supreme Court repealed the verdict following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office and referred the case back to the District Court for a re @-@ trial .
one of the accused is currently serving time in an open prison on account of another offence .
proceedings initially mainly involved the reconstruction of the series of events on the night of the crime .
the police inspec@@ tor responsible at the time was invited as a witness .
the central point of focus was on mobile phone conversations between the accused and third parties , which the police had intercepted .
what makes things difficult is that Rock@@ ers almost always observe what they consider to be complete silence appearing before the court - they say absolutely nothing .
this also applies in the case of the victims .
in the first trial , only one of the victims spoke out .
when asked , Public Prosecutor Stefan Gol@@ fier of the Frankfurt ( Oder ) Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office said that new evidence had come to light since the previous trial .
a further eleven days of proceedings have been scheduled for the trial .
the thro@@ wa@@ way society does not think
the night was long , the music loud and the atmosphere good , but at some point everyone has to go home .
except : in the stom@@ achs of those in the passenger and back seats , hunger strikes .
of course , this may be down to the odd cocktail or glass of bub@@ bly !
so what could be more natural than to cas@@ ually pull into the next drive @-@ through to pick yourself up a little treat ?
I admit , I am right with you with it comes to picking up some fast food late at night , or early in the morning as the case may be .
a few chips , a co@@ ke , a burger - and then straight home and into bed !
however , on the way home the clear differences between me and other hungry club@@ bers become evident .
what is wrong with people who continually throw their fast food bags out of the car window ? !
at the weekend in particular , discarded paper bags can be found at the side of the road and in car parks .
&quot; why is this ? &quot; I ask myself .
are the people too stupid to take their bags home or throw them into the nearest rubbish bin ?
after all , waste paper does more than spoil the landscape .
bags have also been seen covering transport facilities such as crash barriers , thus causing accidents .
however , the so @-@ called &quot; thro@@ wa@@ way society &quot; does not think about such things . they probably do not even know what the term even means .
if you are often out and about in the evening , more often than not with several people in the car , you will know what a back seat can look like after having parti@@ ed through the night : clothes , bottles and other rubbish begin to pile up .
a few bags won &apos;t make much of a difference there - in contrast to on the street where no @-@ one wants to tr@@ ample through other peoples &apos; lefto@@ ver food .
I can see the day coming when towns and municipalities will get fed up clearing up - and the fast food chains will have to operate a deposit scheme for their bags .
Obama &apos;s Health Care Walk Back
amid a fi@@ restor@@ m of criticism , President Obama yesterday walked back his oft @-@ repeated , unambiguous promise that &quot; if you like your health plan , you can keep it . &quot;
with hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers , Republicans have sl@@ ammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public .
yesterday , Obama tweak@@ ed his original pledge .
&quot; for the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works , you can keep it , &quot; he said in a speech in Boston .
addressing what he called the &quot; fl@@ urry in the news &quot; about the cancellations , Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace .
most people are going to be able to get better , comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected .
&quot; you &apos;re going to get a better deal , &quot; he said .
the administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn &apos;t meet the new standards required under the Af@@ for@@ dable Care Act .
&quot; let me say directly to these Americans : you deserve better , &quot; Seb@@ elius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington .
Seb@@ elius , who is overseeing implementation of the Af@@ for@@ dable Care Act , said the launch of the online marketplace has gone &quot; miser@@ ably &quot; since October .
&quot; I am as frustrated and angry as anyone , &quot; she said .
I am eager to earn your confidence back .
an ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated Seb@@ elius ut@@ tered that phrase , caught by a hot mic , to an aide seated behind her at yesterday &apos;s House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep@@ . Billy Long , R @-@ Mo . , over whether she should be required to en@@ roll in Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are .
more than three hours into the hearing , Long repeatedly pressed Seb@@ elius on why the &quot; architect &quot; of the Af@@ for@@ dable Care Act has not voluntarily for@@ gone government @-@ sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through Health@@ Care@@ .@@ gov , which she is now pit@@ ching to millions of Americans .
the government in Jerusalem fails to confirm an attack on the Syrian air@@ force base
on Thursday , an American government official , who wished to remain anonymous , made a statement to American news broad@@ caster CNN , stating that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an air@@ force base in the Syrian town of Lat@@ akia the day before .
the target was &quot; missiles and related equipment , &quot; which the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .
the Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as Arabic broad@@ caster Al @-@ Arab@@ iya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of Lat@@ akia was fired upon during the night from Wednesday to Thursday , and the Israelis were identified as the responsible party .
Israeli television broad@@ caster Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Lat@@ akia , in which Russian S @-@ 125 Ne@@ wa @-@ type defence missiles and a battery of SA @-@ 3 missiles could be seen , which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport war@@ heads weighing up to 70 kilograms .
unsure , the government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , press agency Reuters has also quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believed that Israel had carried out the attack , but was not sure .
in any case , a spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : &quot; we are not commenting on these reports . &quot;
journalist Ron Ben @-@ Y@@ is@@ hai , writing for daily newspaper Y@@ edi@@ oth Ahr@@ on@@ oth , emphasised that the Syrian regime had already previously attempted , in some cases successfully , to deliver ground to air missiles to Hezbollah .
the Israeli government had previously repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be crossing a &quot; red line , &quot; which would result in a military response .
John Kerry says US sp@@ ying has &quot; reached too far in@@ appropriately &quot; in unprecedented admission
John Kerry has indicated a sof@@ tening of the U.@@ S &apos;s defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its sp@@ ying has &quot; reached too far in@@ appropriately . &quot;
the Secretary of State also admitted that he &apos;d been guilty , along with Barack Obama , of being on &quot; automatic pilot &quot; as incen@@ diary revelations from whist@@ leb@@ lower Edward Snow@@ den about the N@@ SA &apos;s sp@@ ying activities emerged .
the leaks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
speaking to an open government conference in London via video link , Mr Kerry said : &quot; there is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there , going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War , and then , of course , 9 / 11 . &quot;
he then became the first high @-@ ranking member of the U.@@ S government to admit that US sp@@ ying had crossed the line , but emphasised that no one &apos;s rights had been abused .
he said : &quot; in some cases , it has reached too far in@@ appropriately . &quot;
and the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse .
I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process .
Mr Kerry insisted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
he added : &quot; we &apos;re dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up . &quot;
there is radical extremism in the world that is hell @-@ bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments .
so what if you were able to interc@@ ept that and stop it before it happens ?
we have actually prevented airplanes from going down , buildings from being blown up , and people from being assassinated because we &apos;ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plans .
meanwhile , U.S. law@@ makers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. sp@@ ying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti @-@ terrorism efforts with the U.S. , the chairman of a Senate sub@@ committee on European affairs said on Thursday .
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti @-@ terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency .
&quot; it &apos;s really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti @-@ terrorism endea@@ vors , &quot; Murphy , a first @-@ term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs , said in an interview from Washington .
and I &apos;m going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism , notwithstanding their anger over these N@@ SA programs .
news reports that the N@@ SA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have fra@@ yed relations with some U.S. allies , though the agency &apos;s chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States .
other revelations cited documents leaked by Snow@@ den that the N@@ SA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s cell@@ phone and those of up to 34 other world leaders .
the national intelligence director , James cl@@ apper , defended sp@@ ying on allies as necessary and said it &apos;s commonplace on both sides .
amid the upro@@ ar , Murphy said his office is arranging the congres@@ sional trip , expected to take place this year , and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers .
names of other participating law@@ makers were to be released in coming days .
he said the itinerary is still being worked out .
while Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships , he said some &quot; tough love &quot; will also be dispens@@ ed .
he said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they &apos;ve used for years themselves .
&quot; while we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans , they also need to come to terms with the fact that we &apos;re not the only ones that are out there sp@@ ying , &quot; Murphy said .
meanwhile , Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address ran@@ c@@ or over U.S. strategies in the Syria , Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities .

Australian woman appeals Thai jail time
a 21 @-@ year @-@ old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for fal@@ sely claiming she was ass@@ aulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail .
St@@ evi@@ e Rochelle Bam@@ ford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver , with two other men res@@ training her , carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10 .
however , CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend .
Phuket police interviewed Bam@@ ford for two days before she conf@@ essed to fabric@@ ating the story .
she was held in local police cells before the court hearing .
Bam@@ ford was sentenced to serve the 15 @-@ day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women &apos;s jail .
she is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter tun@@ ks , who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter .
tun@@ ks told Sydney &apos;s Sunday Teleg@@ raph the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about his daughter &apos;s welfare and wanted her back in Australia .
&quot; it &apos;s obviously been a worrying time but we &apos;re hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible , &quot; tun@@ ks said .
Bam@@ ford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht .
reports in Australia said that in the meantime , she was holi@@ da@@ ying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand .
Thai @-@ based legal sources said Bam@@ ford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison .
however , following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand may also be looking to repair its batter@@ ed tourist image , leading to an acqu@@ itt@@ al .
